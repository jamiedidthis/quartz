But with emotions, it‚Äôs not always clear who ‚Äúowns‚Äù them.

The image asks us to consider that as much as a boundary is a limit, it‚Äôs also a meeting place.

The primary task in all healing relationships‚Äîsuch as that between a therapist and client‚Äîis to listen deeply. Conversely, traumatic relationships are ones in which people consistently deny, overlook, and avoid each other‚Äôs truths.

In 2017, positive psychology researchers published findings that suggested emodiversity‚Äîwhich they defined as ‚Äúthe breadth and relative abundance of emotions that individuals experience‚Äù‚Äîis more significant to wellness than happiness. When they asked 175 adults between the ages of forty and fifty to record their positive and negative emotions over thirty days, they discovered that those who reported a broader range of emotions had less inflammation, a biological process that has been linked to both early morbidity and mortality, but also to emotional states.</description></item><item><title>Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/frankenstein/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/frankenstein/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mary-wollstonecraft-shelley/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mary-wollstonecraft-shelley/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The importance of anger</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-importance-of-anger/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-importance-of-anger/</guid><description>From [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]], [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]]:
Validating fury in ourselves and others isn‚Äôt simply a means to an end of making it go away‚Äî==if your goal is to squash it, you‚Äôre not really validating anything.== Evolutionary psychology researchers have suggested a thing called ==the recalibration theory of anger==, which suggests that anger evolved to help us increase our social bargaining power and ensure that we demand better deals for ourselves when we‚Äôve either been slighted or might be again.</description></item><item><title>Moral dumbfounding</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/moral-dumbfounding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 21:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/moral-dumbfounding/</guid><description>Moral judgement and moral reasoning are basically two different processes.
