While there are people out there with malicious intentions, abuse can often happen when there’s no intent to harm.</description></item><item><title>All relationships involve power</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/all-relationships-involve-power/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/all-relationships-involve-power/</guid><description>Every relationship involves a power exchange, and learning the dynamics of power exchanges can be key to navigating relationships in general—and I’d argue life in general. It gets a hell of a lot easier to spot abuse and control.
Just as all power relationships are relationships, all relationships also involve power.</description></item><item><title>Confusion is a crucible</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/confusion-is-a-crucible/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/confusion-is-a-crucible/</guid><description>On the whole radical acceptance front, even confusion—especially confusion—can be enormously helpful in our lives. It points to where the soil needs to be tilled, old ways dug up and new ways cultivated and planted.
The idea that confusion could have therapeutic value is powerful because it takes a human condition that’s generally thought to be negative and suggests that it could actually be a kind of crucible.</description></item><item><title>How to detect manipulation</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/how-to-detect-manipulation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/how-to-detect-manipulation/</guid><description>If you feel muddled, scrambled, disoriented, that’s a sign of psychological manipulation/distortion, or often downright abuse. If you feel clarity, even if it’s challenging and uncomfortable, you’re likely on to something true.
Note: to me this is different than feeling uncertain. Uncertainty is an honest and even necessary state, open to inquiry and reflection.</description></item><item><title>Pleasure can be therapeutic</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/pleasure-can-be-therapeutic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/pleasure-can-be-therapeutic/</guid><description>In Who Gets to Medicate Me?, Jesse Meadows (@sluggish) interrogates the cultural, puritanical idea that pleasure is destructive.
Psychoactive drugs have direct effects on us, and sometimes those effects feel good, which can be helpful in itself. Puritanical thought and anti-drug propaganda have led us to think of pleasure as destructive, but pleasure can be therapeutic, too.</description></item><item><title>Self-censorship is primarily state censorship</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-censorship-is-primarily-state-censorship/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-censorship-is-primarily-state-censorship/</guid><description>State censorship shapes and causes self-censorship, directly and intentionally. To act like it’s primarily a civilian phenomenon is to perpetuate the illusion and miss the point entirely.
Hence, my biggest conclusion, the majority of real censorship is self-censorship, but the majority of self-censorship is intentionally cultivated by an outside power trying to cause that self-censorship to occur.</description></item><item><title>The holistic definition of trauma</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-holistic-definition-of-trauma/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-holistic-definition-of-trauma/</guid><description>One of the most accurate definitions of trauma I’ve found is from [[books/chinese medicine for the mind|Chinese Medicine for the Mind]] ([[authors/nina cheng|Nina Cheng]]), which acknowledges that it involves many aspects of emotional, psychological, and physiological conditions.
The defining characteristics:
Overwhelms the nervous system Violates boundaries Disrupts relationality Severs connections Admits feelings of powerlessness Damages the sense of meaning Inhibits the sense of self Disrupts contact with the self Instigates or stimulates collapse/separation of yin and yang (dysregulation) Interestingly, I was just looking up TRE on the cptsdfoundation.</description></item><item><title>The three lies of power</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-three-lies-of-power/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-three-lies-of-power/</guid><description>For all the aspiring authoritarians wanting to “do the right thing” and force their good ideas on everyone, [[authors/adam mastroianni|Adam Mastroianni]] outlines the wildly delusional three lies of power:

Propaganda blitzes are fast-moving attacks intended to inflict maximum damage in minimum time. They are:
based on allegations of dramatic new evidence communicated with high emotional intensity and moral outrage apparently supported by an informed corporate media/academic/expert consensus reinforced by damning condemnation of anyone daring even to question the apparent consensus often generated with fortuitous timing characterised by tragicomic moral dissonance Every one of these things, much less the concatenation of all of them, signals red flag, red flag, red flag.</description></item><item><title>At every level we are a web of interdependencies</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</guid><description>When we talk about being inseparable from the universe, or an animistic view of the world, it’s not uniformity, conformity, or a primordial soup where everything is nothing and nothing is everything. From the macro to the micro, it’s very much a web of interdependencies.</description></item><item><title>Core values</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/core-values/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/core-values/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Emodiversity is a sign of well-being</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emodiversity-is-a-sign-of-well-being/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emodiversity-is-a-sign-of-well-being/</guid><description>Experiencing a broad range of emotions, aka “emodiversity,” is more significant to wellness than happiness. The more we feel, the less we resist feeling, which leads to states of chronic stress and inflammation.
In 2017, positive psychology researchers published findings that suggested emodiversity—which they defined as “the breadth and relative abundance of emotions that individuals experience”—is more significant to wellness than happiness.</description></item><item><title>Emotions are experienced individually and collectively</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emotions-are-experienced-individually-and-collectively/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emotions-are-experienced-individually-and-collectively/</guid><description>From [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]], [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]]:
But with emotions, it’s not always clear who “owns” them. I’ve woken up heavy with the boulder of my grandmother’s grief on my chest, breathed deeply while sweating from the fire of my mother’s rage, and I could say, “That’s theirs, not mine,” if I wanted to, but what good would that do?</description></item><item><title>Getting clear on your core values prevents manipulation</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/getting-clear-on-your-core-values-prevents-manipulation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/getting-clear-on-your-core-values-prevents-manipulation/</guid><description>One of the most valuable things I learned in therapy is how to define my own core values and principles.

When we say that human behavior is unpredictable, we are right, because it is too complex to be predicted, especially by ourselves.</description></item><item><title>Individuality is inseparable from community</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/individuality-is-inseparable-from-community/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/individuality-is-inseparable-from-community/</guid><description>It shouldn’t surprise me anymore that I keep running across taoism when reading about anarchism or indigenous animism, or running across anarchism/animism when reading about the tao. (But it still does, bc I wanna stay childlike like that ☺️)
The principle is that if everything is allowed to go its own way the harmony of the universe will be established, since every process in the world can “do its own thing” only in relation to all others.</description></item><item><title>Is fear of groupthink another pursuit of purity?</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/is-fear-of-groupthink-another-pursuit-of-purity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/is-fear-of-groupthink-another-pursuit-of-purity/</guid><description>Is ridding yourself of all “groupthink” another pursuit of purity? Does the quest for purity only happen within the groupthink/ideology? Are there elements of “groupthink” that are merely the human traits as a communal species? Like censorship, there has never been some ideal state without it, only existing to various healthy or toxic degrees?</description></item><item><title>Mute the narrative soundtrack for global politics</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mute-the-narrative-soundtrack-for-global-politics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mute-the-narrative-soundtrack-for-global-politics/</guid><description>Much like mindfulness helps cut through the internal noise, muting the narrative helps cut through the external noise.
Learn the art of perceiving life without the perceptual filter of narrative. Mentally “mute” the narrative soundtrack and watch where all the resources are going, where the weapons are moving to and coming from, who’s being killed and imprisoned etc, to get a clear picture of what’s going on in the world.</description></item><item><title>No organization is organic</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/no-organization-is-organic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/no-organization-is-organic/</guid><description>No organization, in the political and commercial sense of the word, is organic. Organizations, in this sense, are based on the following of linear rules and laws imposed from above—that is, of strung-out, serial, one-thing-at-a-time sequences of words and signs which can never grasp the complexity of nature, although nature is only “complex” in relation to the impossible task of translating it into these linear signs.</description></item><item><title>Nothing is all good or all bad, even black and white thinking</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/nothing-is-all-good-or-all-bad-even-black-and-white-thinking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/nothing-is-all-good-or-all-bad-even-black-and-white-thinking/</guid><description>The idea that nothing is all good or all bad is, paradoxically, is also true for “black-and-white” thinking. Sometimes the straightforward, yes-or-no, this-or-that way is beneficial.
I like how [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]] puts it in [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]], referring to the ace of swords:</description></item><item><title>Purity and supremacy go hand-in-hand</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/purity-and-supremacy-go-hand-in-hand/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/purity-and-supremacy-go-hand-in-hand/</guid><description>This has been one of my private working theories for years, and the more I see confirms it. Any aspiration towards purity—be it spiritual, moral, ideological, cultural, political, on and on—leads to supremacy. The concept of purity means that impurity exists, so you’re drawing a line between the two, and placing yourself on the side that is elevated, superior, preferred.</description></item><item><title>Self-organizing systems of vast complexity are the way of the world</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</guid><description>We get in trouble when we try to impose external, hierarchical order on ourselves—much like how monoculture fails to thrive, and instead entangled ecosystems are key.
If you think chaos is the only result of a non-hierarchal system, your own body disproves it. Try to get your mind to tell your lungs to breathe, your heart to beat, your stomach to digest, your skin to sweat, your colon to poop.</description></item><item><title>The boundary is a meeting place</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-boundary-is-a-meeting-place/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-boundary-is-a-meeting-place/</guid><description>Instead of only viewing a boundary as a limit, what if we also view it as a meeting place? Therefore the boundary is doubly necessary—to meet people where they are, we must be where we are, not overextending ourselves into places we don’t belong.
This happens internally too.</description></item><item><title>The importance of anger</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-importance-of-anger/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-importance-of-anger/</guid><description>From [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]], [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]]:
Validating fury in ourselves and others isn’t simply a means to an end of making it go away—==if your goal is to squash it, you’re not really validating anything.== Evolutionary psychology researchers have suggested a thing called ==the recalibration theory of anger==, which suggests that anger evolved to help us increase our social bargaining power and ensure that we demand better deals for ourselves when we’ve either been slighted or might be again.</description></item><item><title>The principle of mutual arising</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-principle-of-mutual-arising/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-principle-of-mutual-arising/</guid><description>It is basic to the Taoist view of the world that every thing-event (shì 事 or wù 物) is what it is only in relation to all others. The earth, and every tiniest thing upon it, inevitably “goes-with” the sun, moon, and stars. It needs them just as much as it needs, and consists of, its own elements.</description></item><item><title>The relationship abuse checklist</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-relationship-abuse-checklist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-relationship-abuse-checklist/</guid><description>In the years since I read it, I still haven’t come across a better relationship inventory than [[authors/anton fulmen|Anton Fulmen’s]] in [[books/the dominance playbook|The Dominance Playbook]]. (Leave it to the kink community to nail down the dynamics of abuse.) I reference it all the time, and what I like most is it applies to any interactions between people, not just sexual or romantic relationships.</description></item><item><title>“Complexity” is sometimes noise</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/complexity-is-sometimes-noise/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/complexity-is-sometimes-noise/</guid><description>Note to self: as someone who always strives to grasp complexity and nuance, recognize when that can be used against me, especially when it comes to global politics.

I hope that means it’s becoming common knowledge, because it often really is that simple: trust is simple and usually very obvious.</description></item><item><title>We are making ourselves up as we go</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-making-ourselves-up-as-we-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 02:01:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-making-ourselves-up-as-we-go/</guid><description>The current cultural orthodoxy, often formulated or short-handed as “stay in your lane,” postulates that a writer ought to remain centered in their own community, to write from their own and their community’s experience: to stay home.

Lila (or leela) can be loosely translated as “divine play”. The concept of lila asserts that creation, instead of being an objective for achieving any purpose, is rather an outcome of the playful nature of the divine.</description></item><item><title>The human mind mistakes its opinions for truth</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-human-mind-mistakes-its-opinions-for-truth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-human-mind-mistakes-its-opinions-for-truth/</guid><description>I think of it like this: we’re always missing data.

We tend instinctively to call things censorship primarily when we perceive those involved to have bad intentions. But we tend to excuse or discount censorious actions when we perceive the motives to be good.</description></item><item><title>We exist only in relationship to others</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-exist-only-in-relationship-to-others/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-exist-only-in-relationship-to-others/</guid><description>We cannot exist apart from each other.

When the nineteenth-century medicolegal term “homosexuality” was brought into official Catholic speech, it replaced the eleventh-century theological term “sodomy.” “Homosexuality” took the place of “sodomy” in the way a substitute teacher takes over a class.</description></item><item><title>All fiction is fanfiction</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/all-fiction-is-fanfiction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/all-fiction-is-fanfiction/</guid><description>You knooooow I will get on this soapbox all day long.

It’s a practice “as old as philosophy itself,”1 and a central element of mysticism and early Christian thought.
I like the turn of phrase in this one: the Mystical Languages of Unsaying.</description></item><item><title>Be like a cat and let go of yourself</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/be-like-a-cat-and-let-go-of-yourself/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/be-like-a-cat-and-let-go-of-yourself/</guid><description>The more relaxed you are, the more flexible you are, the more lightly you land.
When a cat falls out of a tree, it lets go of itself. The cat becomes completely relaxed, and lands lightly on the ground. But if a cat were about to fall out of a tree and suddenly make up its mind that it didn’t want to fall, it would become tense and rigid, and would be just a bag of broken bones upon landing.</description></item><item><title>Behaviorist theory proves retributive justice does not work</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/behaviorist-theory-proves-retributive-justice-does-not-work/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/behaviorist-theory-proves-retributive-justice-does-not-work/</guid><description>Behaviorism claims that the only thing powerful enough to spur people into action is the promise of reward or the fear of punishment.

Some of the conflict between saying sexuality is a choice might be this erotic plasticity.
In fact, women in general are far more likely than men to report being bisexual. Tellingly, they’re also more likely to change their self-identification as straight or gay during their adult lives.</description></item><item><title>Both memes and needlework are collective folk texts</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/both-memes-and-needlework-are-collective-folk-texts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/both-memes-and-needlework-are-collective-folk-texts/</guid><description>“Teks,” the root of “technology,” meant a treatise on an art, craft, or grammar, before the meaning transferred to mechanical arts and then to digital tech.

Bottom-up thinkers have an associative thought process, an inductive approach, a “details-before-the-concept” type brain.
[[notes/autism|Autistic people]] tend to belong overwhelmingly to the second category.1

Monocropping/monoculture leads to a very precarious existence, prone to disease, collapse, and death. But the more diverse the ecosystem, the more robust and healthy it is.
Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Fungi are also dependent on very stable conditions and support other species underground, protecting them from complete collapse and ensuring one species of tree doesn’t dominate.</description></item><item><title>Everything is fiction</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/everything-is-fiction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/everything-is-fiction/</guid><description>Lest we get so attached to our stories we can’t surrender them, remember: what we experience and the way we describe it is fiction.
