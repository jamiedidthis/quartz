Holy crap, I think so. The struggle. The hope. The tenderness.

I should probably wait till the end of the trilogy to make declarative statements, but there’s WWI spies and bookshops and gentle friendship despite odds and this is as far into my wheelhouse as you can get until, like, sheep herding or Belgium is involved.</description></item><item><title>Pet</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pet/</guid><description>A YA book that discusses [[authors/hannah arendt|Hannah Arendt]] and [[books/the origins of totalitarianism|the banality of evil]] in the introduction, then goes on to drop some biblically accurate angels?</description></item><item><title>The Henchmen of Zenda</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-henchmen-of-zenda/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-henchmen-of-zenda/</guid><description>When KJ Charles is on, she’s on.
