Every time, tingling chills down my spine on page 254:
I am the window through which you watch the coming storm. He is the lightning.

And it’s often difficult to articulate why.
This is one of the above. I just loved the… gentleness of it.</description></item><item><title>Inferno</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/inferno/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/inferno/</guid><description>So good to read this while steeped in Florentine history. These are real people and real places, not just an abstract Lewis-esque allegory. Now I wish I knew Italian to read his terza rima original, especially since I’ve had to dig through the Longfellow to see what’s underneath.</description></item><item><title>Gideon the Ninth</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gideon-the-ninth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:43:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gideon-the-ninth/</guid><description>WOULD HAVE HARROWHARK’S BABIES.
I mean, it’s a good thing I like nice people in real life, because in fiction, Harrowhark is 10000% my type.
And just, 10/10 on working through your Catholic upbringing by writing meme-filled fic about blood sacrifice and redemption and necromancy and lesbian saints and cavaliers.</description></item><item><title>Parable of the Sower</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/parable-of-the-sower/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:43:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/parable-of-the-sower/</guid><description>I loved the Earthseed parts of this (God is Change), but the dystopia parts went the way of most dystopias for me, almost too limited in its imagination? It also feels like only half of a whole, so I think that’s part of it too.

Be still my heart! This was brilliant. It would be easier to make a list of the things I didn’t like about it than all the things I loved. The things I didn’t like: zero.</description></item><item><title>Paladin of Souls</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paladin-of-souls/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 15:55:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paladin-of-souls/</guid><description>Magnificent. I didn’t think Bujold could top Cazaril as a character, and she does. Illvin and beloved Ista. Such a rich, full, scarred world she’s created. It spoke to me deeply, even more than the first. I cried. I felt joy-struck. Cursed, bitter Ista is also blessed, beloved Ista.</description></item><item><title>Purgatorio</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/purgatorio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/purgatorio/</guid><description>Reading this alongside Guido Ruggiero’s [[books/the renaissance in italy|The Renaissance in Italy]] is A+ recommended. Once again, vastly more interesting than my first exposure, where school curriculum wanted it read like it was Pilgrim’s Progress. I needed the Bondanella introduction back then to dispense with the nonsense: “Such allegorical abstractions are simply not what Dante’s great poem is all about.</description></item><item><title>Parable of the Talents</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/parable-of-the-talents/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:43:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/parable-of-the-talents/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sword &amp; Citadel</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sword-citadel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:43:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sword-citadel/</guid><description>Ugh, my [[notes/puzzle-book worldbuilding|puzzle-loving brain]] absolutely loved this. Even all the places where it was like, Gene, your Roman Catholicism is showing. And when apparently such brilliant flights of imagination can’t imagine a different role for women in the universe.
But the brilliant ideas were brilliant, and the execution thereof.</description></item><item><title>Seven Surrenders</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/seven-surrenders/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 13:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/seven-surrenders/</guid><description>There’s no way I can talk comprehensively about this series, so for now I’m just going to keep a running list of different things I notice each time I read them. This time (2/2023), it was how the many names for JEDD Mason echoes the [[notes/apophatic naming|apophatic naming]] of God, a classical theological strategy of the “negative” naming, an effort to call God by every time, thereby acknowledging and preserving God’s transcendence of all of them.</description></item><item><title>Harrow the Ninth</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/harrow-the-ninth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 11:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/harrow-the-ninth/</guid><description>Amount of times this book made me cry: [redacted]. It is a sum equal to or only slightly less than the amount of times it made me cackle, gasp, and yelp.
“I cannot behold that apocalypse, Harrow. I think you are one of the only Lyctors who can really and truly understand apocalypse… It is not a death of fire.</description></item><item><title>The Will to Battle</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-will-to-battle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 22:56:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-will-to-battle/</guid><description>Reader, I cried like Mycroft Canner. It’s very much the first half of a whole (third quarter of four?), and it needs [[books/perhaps the stars|the last book]] to be complete, but what a feat it is on its own.</description></item><item><title>The Hallowed Hunt</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-hallowed-hunt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 15:55:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-hallowed-hunt/</guid><description>Not the heights of Ista or Cazaril, but going backwards in this timeline instead of forwards is a choice I admire. I can see returning to this one as often as the two favorites, especially if those two get worn out by re-reading.</description></item><item><title>Paradiso</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paradiso/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paradiso/</guid><description>My dilemma since the early years of Sunday school: hell is more interesting than paradise. Thus, true to form, though I wanted to be contrary, [[books/inferno|Inferno]] is more interesting than any amount of heavenly light (so bright! so much dancing!), but get to that last line and you can’t help but feel the awe and poetry of it:</description></item><item><title>Nona the Ninth</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/nona-the-ninth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:43:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/nona-the-ninth/</guid><description>Verdict still stands after book three: would have Harrowhark’s babies.
The end of [[books/gideon the ninth|Gideon]] had some pacing things, the start of [[books/harrow the ninth|Harrow]] had some pacing things; Nona was the one I barreled through in 1.5 days because I could not put the book down.</description></item><item><title>Perhaps the Stars</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/perhaps-the-stars/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 23:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/perhaps-the-stars/</guid><description>I still haven’t found the words to talk about this one. Maybe next year I will. It should be in the Smithsonian, or win the Nobel prize, or something, as one of humanity’s greatest achievements.</description></item><item><title>Tarot for Change</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tarot-for-change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tarot-for-change/</guid><description>I’d prefer a bit less Joseph Campbell and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,1 but overall, the best book on tarot I’ve encountered so far. Or, rather than a definitive superlative, it’s the book that most resonates with me so far. It’s how I engage with tarot, not for divination, but therapeutically, creatively, narratively, for introspection and storytelling.</description></item><item><title>The Cyclist and His Shadow</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-cyclist-and-his-shadow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-cyclist-and-his-shadow/</guid><description>I like how right away, in the forward, Thomazeau François is pitting this book against [[books/the rider|The Rider]] as the seminal classic of cycling literature. I arched a skeptical eyebrow, and… was in total agreement by like, chapter 3.
Brilliant. Insane. Philosophical. Spiritual. Erotic. I read it during the nearly-hallucinatory six hours of Milan—San Remo and feel like bits of it have embedded in my brain like gravel, because I think of it every time I watch a race.</description></item><item><title>What is Tao?</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/what-is-tao/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/what-is-tao/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Finding the Fool</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/finding-the-fool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/finding-the-fool/</guid><description>Bounced off it big time. I like the introduction, especially with Meg Jones Wall’s ex-evangelical background, but once she got to the cards, very little resonated. I feel at odds with her perspective and energy level, and not in a challenging, interesting way. I’ll stick with [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]] and keep exploring.</description></item><item><title>The Believers</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-believers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-believers/</guid><description>“The Believers”—as in, the first of the eight stories, from which this collection takes its title—is a barnburner. A houseburner? That’s what literally happens in the end, when a couple from Jamaica try to disentangle themselves from the creepy church who sponsors them in Brooklyn and wants to marry off their daughter.</description></item><item><title>The Saint of Bright Doors</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-saint-of-bright-doors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-saint-of-bright-doors/</guid><description>Gobsmacked at how good this is, without even the caveat of “for a first novel.” Fetter, the feral only child of a messiah, trained by his mother as assassin, destined to commit matricide and fratricide, navigates a dystopian Sri Lanka far too recognizable in the present.</description></item><item><title>Goddess</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/goddess/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/goddess/</guid><description>Chapbooks and zines are an art form, the ideal container for poetry. I wanted more of this one, which is the indication of a good chapbook indeed.

It’s a great and thorough introduction. I can’t attest to how well it stacks up against others of its ilk, but it suited my needs and rewarded my curiosity. Beautifully designed too, which counts for a lot.</description></item><item><title>Lent</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/lent/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 15:55:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/lent/</guid><description>It seems like every year there’s a book that I want to beg people to read because I struggle to describe it, and it’s nothing like what they’d expect. This year, it’s this book.
It’s beautiful. It’s delightful and unusual and quietly profound. It’s a master class in plot.</description></item><item><title>The Second Safest Mountain</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-second-safest-mountain/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 22:54:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-second-safest-mountain/</guid><description>What even is Otava Heikkilä’s brain? There are nuns and orgies and authoritarian patriarchal tentacle gods, and it maps completely onto the experience of being outcast in our world, for simply being true to yourself. As with [[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]], the images are more powerful than words.</description></item><item><title>Conversion</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/conversion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 13:53:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/conversion/</guid><description>A 12th century missionary finds shelter in a blizzard with a gruff, kindhearted hermit. The conversion is his own, shedding the self-loathing shame for genuine tender romantic connection. Like with [[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]], Heikkilä does so much with so little, spare art and spare dialogue packing a punch of emotions.</description></item><item><title>Always Coming Home</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/always-coming-home/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 12:40:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/always-coming-home/</guid><description>I’ve been saving this one because [[notes/the carrier bag theory of fiction|the Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction]] has been such a foundational text for me, and this is where Ursula, more than ever, puts that theory to practice.
As Shruti Swamy says in the introduction, what is on offer here is a profoundly different way of looking, seeing, even thinking.</description></item><item><title>Tao Te Ching</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tao-te-ching/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 12:40:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tao-te-ching/</guid><description>In my opinion, the definitive text. The Ursula K. Le Guin translation (and footnotes!) is everything. Nobody listens to language the way Ursula does. If [[books/kalpa imperial|Kalpa Imperial]] was an ideal pairing between text and translator, this is even more so.
From her introduction:
“It is the most lovable of all the great religious texts, funny, keen, kind, modest, indestructibly outrageous, and inexhaustibly refreshing.</description></item><item><title>Tao Te Ching: A New English Version</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tao-te-ching-a-new-english-version/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 15:55:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tao-te-ching-a-new-english-version/</guid><description>Since I had [[books/tao te ching|Ursula K. Le Guin’s translation]] on hand, I picked up Stephen Mitchell’s as well. Reading them side by side: Mitchell’s version is what we expect spiritual texts to be; Le Guin’s is what spiritual texts should be.
In the introduction, he says he played with the text, but there’s very little playfulness involved.</description></item><item><title>The Twice-Drowned Saint</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-twice-drowned-saint/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:15:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-twice-drowned-saint/</guid><description>I don’t even know how the hell to describe this, except amazing. Apparently my unintentional theme lately is biblically accurate angels—see [[books/pet|Pet]], see [[books/exodus 20|Freydís Moon]]. Here, Cooney made the mythology its own thing and the worldbuilding is fiendishly clever. A refugee crisis in the midst of a celestial city with bloodthirsty angels who must be overthrown by two secret saints, a newly-sprouted godhead, and a family of filmmakers and waste collectors—that’s the best stab I can take at the plot.</description></item><item><title>Exodus 20</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/exodus-20/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 13:55:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/exodus-20/</guid><description>If you’re gonna write monster kink, make it a biblically accurate angel.
