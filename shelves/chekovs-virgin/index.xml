I thought I could just dip my toe in, get the gist, no harm done. I’d only read [[books/heaven official’s blessing vol 1|one other xianxia]] at that point and it was by the same author, so I’d just read others in the meantime to have more points of comparison by the time I got around to evaluating MDZS as a whole.</description></item><item><title>Something Fabulous</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/something-fabulous/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/something-fabulous/</guid><description>So far the theme of the year is romances that I read and then re-read right away and install on my best-of-year list (best-of-ever list too, in the case of Something Fabulous, which more than lives up to its name).
A few notes:
We’re starting to see the books written during the pandemic where authors are writing what they WANT, not what they SHOULD.</description></item><item><title>Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation Vol 2</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation Vol 3</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-3/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation Vol 4</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-4/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation Vol 5</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-5/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Band Sinister</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/band-sinister/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 14:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/band-sinister/</guid><description>If this isn’t everything that’s wholesome and good in the world, I don’t know what is.

One of those books where I have to be careful what I read next because it might not measure up.</description></item></channel></rss>
