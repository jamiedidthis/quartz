How do you craft art from the horror? How do you count your loved ones, now dead, in lines of poems?
I read this twice, once fast, once slow, and let it break me. 50 years of occupation and apartheid.</description></item><item><title>From the River to the Sea</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/from-the-river-to-the-sea/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/from-the-river-to-the-sea/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Justice for Some</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justice-for-some/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justice-for-some/</guid><description/></item><item><title>On Palestine</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-palestine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-palestine/</guid><description>Many of the world’s problems are so intractable that it’s hard to think of ways even to take steps toward mitigating them.
The Israel-Palestine conflict is not one of these.
I admit I’ve fallen prey to the line, re: the occupation of Palestine, “it’s too complex to understand.</description></item><item><title>Ten Myths About Israel</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ten-myths-about-israel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ten-myths-about-israel/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Palestine Laboratory</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-palestine-laboratory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-palestine-laboratory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Manufacturing Consent</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/manufacturing-consent/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/manufacturing-consent/</guid><description>Infuriatingly and terrifyingly relevant. Like, up to this very day, where you couldn’t even update the book with current examples because there are too many to choose from. Venezuela, Syria, Iran. Ad infinitum. It’s all following the same script. Where you could argue the book is dated, that actually further proves its point, such as the west’s support and glorification of Putin thirty years ago when he fit their needs in a different way.</description></item><item><title>A Woman Is No Man</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-woman-is-no-man/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 14:35:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-woman-is-no-man/</guid><description>We need more books by Palestinian and Arab authors. I intend to read more by Etaf Rum. But it pains me to say… I think this could have been a (powerful) short story. The structure and even dialogue is very repetitive, in a way that I’m sure is meant to illustrate the cyclical and generational cycle of abuse, but instead means you could skim chapters and not miss anything.</description></item><item><title>Evil Eye</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/evil-eye/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2024 14:35:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/evil-eye/</guid><description>This is why I wanted to read more Etaf Rum. This is the book I knew she had in her. It’s just as brilliant and damning a portrait of a toxic marriage as [[books/liars|Liars]] was, with the added generational trauma and displacement of a Palestinian family.</description></item><item><title>Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/jesus-apocalyptic-prophet-of-the-new-millennium/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 12:34:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/jesus-apocalyptic-prophet-of-the-new-millennium/</guid><description>What I wanted [[books/zealot|Zealot]] to be.</description></item><item><title>Shattered Spear</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/shattered-spear/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 22:00:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/shattered-spear/</guid><description>Such a powerful example of what comics/graphic novels can do, with images more than words. I loved it. And more fiction of any kind set in the neolithic middle east, please.

Puar brings her pathbreaking work on the liberal state, sexuality, and biopolitics to bear on our understanding of disability. Drawing on a stunning array of theoretical and methodological frameworks, Puar uses the concept of “debility”—bodily injury and social exclusion brought on by economic and political factors—to disrupt the category of disability.</description></item><item><title>Zealot</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/zealot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/zealot/</guid><description>Great at painting a picture of 1st century Palestine. So many inaccuracies though! [[books/jesus apocalyptic prophet of the new millennium|Ehrman’s was better]].
Pull quotes Nowhere is any such thing written: not in the Law of Moses, not in the prophets, not in the Psalms. In the entire history of Jewish thought there is not a single line of scripture that says the messiah is to suffer, die, and rise again on the third day, which may explain why Jesus does not bother to cite any scripture to back up his incredible claim.</description></item></channel></rss>
