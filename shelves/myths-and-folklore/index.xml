Masterful use of dialect and structure to deconstruct the traditional bounds of genre and narrative. The way the characters code-switch their way through multiple registers and languages—well-known and invented—is reflected in the way the novella flips through genres like a catalog, exposing the expectations and limitations of each.</description></item><item><title>A Taste of Honey</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-taste-of-honey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-taste-of-honey/</guid><description>That ending!

Le Guin. Because I know I’ll have to stop, and do nothing else, and absorb through my pores, and not read any of the other ten or twelve things I might have read that week, and just camp out in her world as long as I can.</description></item><item><title>When the Tiger Came Down the Mountain</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/when-the-tiger-came-down-the-mountain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/when-the-tiger-came-down-the-mountain/</guid><description>Just as lush and complex as the [[books/the empress of salt and fortune|first one]], and given the smaller scope of the story, arguably my favorite of the two.</description></item><item><title>A Power Unbound</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-power-unbound/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-power-unbound/</guid><description>Here is my theory from [[books/a restless truth|book 2]]: the Blyths suit me best in small doses.

I can see being disappointed with one if you picked it up standalone, but as a collective, each book a different facet of the whole, it’s some brilliant, satisfying storytelling.</description></item><item><title>The Left Hand of Darkness</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-left-hand-of-darkness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-left-hand-of-darkness/</guid><description>Imperfect and still utterly perfect.

Fabulous stuff. Some fav lines:
—Augustus revived a thing that had barely been invented in his own time: “old-time religion,” rather like the nearly postmodern version of Christianity invented in nineteenth-century America and called “fundamentalism.</description></item><item><title>Pantheologies</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pantheologies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pantheologies/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Siren Queen</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/siren-queen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/siren-queen/</guid><description>I’ve been saving this one to be my birthday book because I knew Nghi Vo would deliver.

This book is a masterwork. If I ever mix up my history on the Medicis, the War of the Roses, and the Byzantine Empire, it’s probably because I’ve misremembered this fiction as fact.</description></item><item><title>The Magic Fish</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-magic-fish/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-magic-fish/</guid><description>Wow.

And just on a visual level, what Nguyen does with the coloring for the different timelines, and the extensive notes on historical fashion and mythological context in the afterword make me appreciate it even more.</description></item><item><title>The Twice-Drowned Saint</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-twice-drowned-saint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-twice-drowned-saint/</guid><description>I don’t even know how the hell to describe this, except amazing.
