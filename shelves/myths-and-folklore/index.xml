This book is a masterwork. If I ever mix up my history on the Medicis, the War of the Roses, and the Byzantine Empire, it’s probably because I’ve misremembered this fiction as fact.</description></item><item><title>Underland</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/underland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/underland/</guid><description>For to think in deep time can be a means not of escaping our troubled present, but rather of re-imagining it; countermanding its quick greeds and furies with older, slower stories of making and unmaking.</description></item><item><title>Pantheologies</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pantheologies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pantheologies/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-sorcerer-of-the-wildeeps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-sorcerer-of-the-wildeeps/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pagans</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pagans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pagans/</guid><description>About as beautifully (and concisely) written as you can get for a history book.
