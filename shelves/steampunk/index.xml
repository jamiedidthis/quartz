I was doing the audiobooks and went by the listing on Scribd (now Everand), which had them listed out of order. So I read book 2 first.
I don’t think that changed my opinion of anything.</description></item><item><title>The Wonder Engine</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-wonder-engine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 15:14:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-wonder-engine/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Liberty &amp; Other Stories</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/liberty-and-other-stories/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/liberty-and-other-stories/</guid><description>I did not think I could love the [[series/prosperityverse|Prosperityverse]] more, BUT I DO.</description></item><item><title>Paladin’s Strength</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paladins-strength/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paladins-strength/</guid><description>Oof, it pains me to say I had a tough time with this one. There was so much I liked—mainly CLARA—but it’s so unnecessarily long. Like at least a hundred pages too long because there’s so much repetition and angst and constant unresolved horniness. I love a road trip, I don’t mind a slow burn done right, but here the slow burn veers perilously close to miscommunication.</description></item><item><title>There Will Be Phlogiston</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/there-will-be-phlogiston/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/there-will-be-phlogiston/</guid><description>Well fuck, now [[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]] has competition for most wholesome ever. So short, and so tender, so full of power and beauty.</description></item><item><title>Paladin’s Hope</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paladins-hope/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paladins-hope/</guid><description>Not me, caught up in the spookiness more than the romance. The romance was still solid, though. The audiobooks remain excellent.</description></item><item><title>The Affair of the Mysterious Letter</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-affair-of-the-mysterious-letter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-affair-of-the-mysterious-letter/</guid><description>The only thing I’ve had brain space for this week is Alexis Hall, and I say that as the highest compliment. He brings so much heart, joy, and snark even when he’s writing Sherlock Holmes fanfic with jilted vampires and witch kings and interstellar chicanery. Or should I say, especially when he’s writing Sherlock Holmes fanfic with jilted vampires and witch kings and interstellar chicanery.</description></item><item><title>Aspects</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/aspects/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/aspects/</guid><description>The poignancy of having this one cut off, incomplete.
