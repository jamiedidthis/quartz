(per her translation of the [[books/tao te ching|Tao Te Ching]])
Even where the text is dated, I find it hard to disagree.</description></item><item><title>The Lathe Of Heaven</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-lathe-of-heaven/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 22:48:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-lathe-of-heaven/</guid><description>The most daoist of all her books? And that’s saying something.
I can’t remember the last time I read a book with a truly passive protagonist, where his qualities are not his weakness, but his strength. He doesn’t change who he is. There is no lesson needed.</description></item><item><title>Cloud-Hidden, Whereabouts Unknown</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/cloud-hidden-whereabouts-unknown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/cloud-hidden-whereabouts-unknown/</guid><description>And of course the title is an alt phrasing of the line that gets translated as Cloud Recesses in [[series/mo dao zu shi novel|Mó Dào Zǔ Shī]] ☺️
云深不知处, Yúnshēn Bùzhīchù — derived from Jia Dao’s “Visiting the Absent Hermit”:

It’s a great and thorough introduction. I can’t attest to how well it stacks up against others of its ilk, but it suited my needs and rewarded my curiosity.
