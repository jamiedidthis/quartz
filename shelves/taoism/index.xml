The Ursula K. Le Guin translation (and footnotes!) is everything. Nobody listens to language the way Ursula does.

It’s a great and thorough introduction. I can’t attest to how well it stacks up against others of its ilk, but it suited my needs and rewarded my curiosity. Beautifully designed too, which counts for a lot.</description></item><item><title>Out of Your Mind</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/out-of-your-mind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/out-of-your-mind/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
