Probably my least favorite of the lot, but only due to how much I like the others.</description></item><item><title>The Black Tides of Heaven</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-black-tides-of-heaven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-black-tides-of-heaven/</guid><description>Note from my future self: this makes an excellent prequel, I should have started with [[books/the red threads of fortune|book 2]]!</description></item><item><title>The Empress of Salt and Fortune</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-empress-of-salt-and-fortune/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-empress-of-salt-and-fortune/</guid><description>If you’re partial to storytelling as lush as this cover art, do not miss Nghi Vo.
