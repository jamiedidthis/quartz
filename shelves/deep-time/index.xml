Even all the places where it was like, Gene, your Roman Catholicism is showing. And when apparently such brilliant flights of imagination can’t imagine a different role for women in the universe.
But the brilliant ideas were brilliant, and the execution thereof.</description></item><item><title>Symbiotic Planet</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/symbiotic-planet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/symbiotic-planet/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Underland</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/underland/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/underland/</guid><description>For to think in deep time can be a means not of escaping our troubled present, but rather of re-imagining it; countermanding its quick greeds and furies with older, slower stories of making and unmaking.
Three different siren calls for me: geology, linguistics, and [[notes/deep time decenters the human|deep time]].</description></item><item><title>Rakesfall</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/rakesfall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/rakesfall/</guid><description>For the first half of this, it’s very much a sister-book to [[books/the saint of bright doors|The Saint of Bright Doors]]. If you didn’t like that one, you probably won’t vibe with this one. But if, like me, you loved Saint, then Rakesfall levels up and then some.</description></item><item><title>The City in Glass</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-city-in-glass/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-city-in-glass/</guid><description>The blurbs compared it to [[authors/ursula k le guin|Le Guin]] and [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]], and with any other author, that would be a disastrous claim to make. Here, Nghi Vo only takes the playful metaphysics of Calvino and the gentle worldbuilding of Le Guin, and weaves it with so much raw emotion that this slim little volume shouldn’t be able to contain it all.</description></item><item><title>The Saint of Bright Doors</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-saint-of-bright-doors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-saint-of-bright-doors/</guid><description>Gobsmacked at how good this is, without even the caveat of “for a first novel.” Fetter, the feral only child of a messiah, trained by his mother as assassin, destined to commit matricide and fratricide, navigates a dystopian Sri Lanka far too recognizable in the present.</description></item><item><title>Ficciones</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ficciones/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ficciones/</guid><description>Borges is up to some delightful fuckery, playing with form, inventing books and authors and universes that are just as, to paraphrase, contaminated with fiction as our own history of the world. The stories are brief and vertiginous, mind-boggling and often cheeky. An undisputed masterpiece, even if I’m still partial to [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]], even if Calvino himself would disagree with me (per his essay on Borges in [[books/six memos for the next millennium|Six Memos for the Next Millennium]]).</description></item><item><title>Always Coming Home</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/always-coming-home/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 12:40:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/always-coming-home/</guid><description>I’ve been saving this one because [[notes/the carrier bag theory of fiction|the Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction]] has been such a foundational text for me, and this is where Ursula, more than ever, puts that theory to practice.
As Shruti Swamy says in the introduction, what is on offer here is a profoundly different way of looking, seeing, even thinking.</description></item><item><title>Following the Water</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/following-the-water/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/following-the-water/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Braiding Sweetgrass</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/braiding-sweetgrass/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 14:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/braiding-sweetgrass/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Annals of the Former World</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</guid><description>I’m glad I’m not beyond the age where books I read can change the way I see the world. If that is an age you can reach, I don’t want to. I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.</description></item></channel></rss>
