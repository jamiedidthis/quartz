A houseburner? That’s what literally happens in the end, when a couple from Jamaica try to disentangle themselves from the creepy church who sponsors them in Brooklyn and wants to marry off their daughter.</description></item><item><title>Invisible Cities</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/invisible-cities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/invisible-cities/</guid><description>Still my least favorite Calvino, strange as that may seem when many people rank it his best. Let’s take it for granted that I’m weird and they’re right. It suffers more this time from [[books/kalpa imperial|Kalpa Imperial]], which has much the same vision but with people included.</description></item><item><title>The Baron in the Trees</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-baron-in-the-trees/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-baron-in-the-trees/</guid><description>Calvinooooo. I don’t usually like parables unless they’re by Calvino, then they’re brilliant.</description></item><item><title>The Cloven Viscount</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-cloven-viscount/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-cloven-viscount/</guid><description>Now this is how you do a fable. What a joy the language is, even in translation. Not to mention each character, good and bad alike, equal parts lovable and bizarre. [[books/the complete cosmicomics|Once again]], the only reason I’d want to have kids is to read them Calvino.</description></item><item><title>The Complete Cosmicomics</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-complete-cosmicomics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-complete-cosmicomics/</guid><description>I kind of want to make some babies right now, just so I can curl them up and read them the history of the universe according to Calvino.</description></item><item><title>Siren Queen</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/siren-queen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 15:55:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/siren-queen/</guid><description>I’ve been saving this one to be my birthday book because I knew Nghi Vo would deliver. Hoo boy, did she ever. Fav of the year? What she does with queerness, horror, and myth is just chef’s kiss.</description></item><item><title>Kalpa Imperial</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/kalpa-imperial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/kalpa-imperial/</guid><description>Exquisite. I could gush about it, or quote it; instead, I’ll say that Angélica translated by Ursula is about the best match you could ask for. Up there with [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]] and Orsinian Tales and Always Coming Home. A [[notes/mosaic novel|mosaic novel]], yes?</description></item><item><title>If On A Winter’s Night A Traveler</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/if-on-a-winters-night-a-traveler/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/if-on-a-winters-night-a-traveler/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
