The color palette and visual cues make it more cohesive than you’d think. I’d happily have it on my own shelves or gift it to nieces and nephews, both for art and story alike.</description></item><item><title>Ficciones</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ficciones/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ficciones/</guid><description>Borges is up to some delightful fuckery, playing with form, inventing books and authors and universes that are just as, to paraphrase, contaminated with fiction as our own history of the world. The stories are brief and vertiginous, mind-boggling and often cheeky.

I could gush about it, or quote it; instead, I’ll say that Angélica translated by Ursula is about the best match you could ask for. Up there with [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]] and Orsinian Tales and Always Coming Home. A [[notes/mosaic novel|mosaic novel]], yes?</description></item></channel></rss>
