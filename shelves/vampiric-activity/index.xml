The absolute perfect choice of narrator for a gothic, queer, melodramatic, erotically-charged tale.

Note: I borrowed the audiobook from the library, but I’ve marked this Lanternfish Press edition because I also sought it out solely for the Carmen Maria Machado foreword, which is excellent and should not be missed.</description></item><item><title>Fledgling</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/fledgling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/fledgling/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Dragon Waiting</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dragon-waiting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dragon-waiting/</guid><description>“The Velvet Underground of novels,” as Scott Lynch says in the introduction. This book is a masterwork. If I ever mix up my history on the Medicis, the War of the Roses, and the Byzantine Empire, it’s probably because I’ve misremembered this fiction as fact. It’s a fascinating thought experiment, imagining how the trajectory of history would look different (or not) if Julian the Apostate had had a long, successful rule.</description></item></channel></rss>
