We don’t even know what we don’t know, because the pseudoscience myths we’ve inherited will NOT die; but it’s a gendered world that produces a gendered brain, not our biology.</description></item><item><title>Woman and Nature</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/woman-and-nature/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 02:01:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/woman-and-nature/</guid><description>If I only remember one thing from this book: the pages and pages of historical milestones interspersed with the timeline of witch trials is a devastatingly powerful thing.</description></item><item><title>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-vindication-of-the-rights-of-woman/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-vindication-of-the-rights-of-woman/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sister Outsider</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sister-outsider/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sister-outsider/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/compulsory-heterosexuality-and-lesbian-existence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/compulsory-heterosexuality-and-lesbian-existence/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Woman in the Body</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-woman-in-the-body/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-woman-in-the-body/</guid><description>I had just finished reading this book when the Supreme Court leak happened, which means my ear has been tuned to the language as the outrage exploded and conversations whirled around.
A large part of Emily Martin’s thesis is about the language and metaphor we use for the body—particularly women’s bodies.</description></item><item><title>Staying with the Trouble</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/staying-with-the-trouble/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 19:43:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/staying-with-the-trouble/</guid><description>Drawing from the Greek roots khthon (earth) and kainos ([[notes/concepts of time|time]]), Haraway coins Chthulucene ( not of Lovecraft origins) as an alternative to the monikers Anthropocene or Capitalocene as labels for these turbulent times.
The Anthropocene marks severe discontinuities; what comes after will not be like what came before.</description></item><item><title>Regretting Motherhood</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/regretting-motherhood/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/regretting-motherhood/</guid><description>“Thus, if we see motherhood as impervious to regret – even though regret may accompany all types of human relationships and decisions that we make – ==then we are not taking into account how feeling rules and culturally acceptable ideas about time are used to sustain social orders that are of most benefit to those who already have power in society – at the expense of many others.</description></item><item><title>The Duchess War</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-duchess-war/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jun 2023 22:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-duchess-war/</guid><description>Finally I didn’t bounce off a Courtney Milan! Granted, the Norfolk Southern disaster had me in the mood to read about labor organizing, and that part worked for me better than the romance.
(In theory, I liked Minnie and Robert together, but they didn’t make me feel it, you know.</description></item><item><title>A Room of One’s Own</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-room-of-ones-own/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-room-of-ones-own/</guid><description/></item><item><title>I’m Sorry for My Loss</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/im-sorry-for-my-loss/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/im-sorry-for-my-loss/</guid><description>I know a book is going to be good when it starts off with the way language limits or distorts our understanding of a subject. Recommended to absolutely anyone, with or without a uterus, with or without the intention to procreate. It’s ostensibly about pregnancy loss and miscarriage/stillbirth awareness, but that overlaps with many things—abortion, grief, medical misogyny, racial injustice, human rights.</description></item></channel></rss>
