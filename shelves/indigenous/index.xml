I&amp;rsquo;m glad it finally prompted me to get to it. It’s the history of two centuries of indigenous activism in the context of even broader indigenous exploitation and resistance, and it needs to be more widely known.</description></item><item><title>The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world/</guid><description/></item><item><title>We the Gathered Heat</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/we-the-gathered-heat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/we-the-gathered-heat/</guid><description>Superb. This is how to do an anthology, where the disparate voices are the point—how do we even define AAPI except as “the other,” non-white? Who is the “we” in question? To whom is that category useful? The poems are sorted into themes of “mourn,” “pronounce,” “fight,” “love,” each as powerful as the last.</description></item><item><title>Country Queers</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/country-queers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/country-queers/</guid><description>A book after my little southern queer heart. Garringer crisscrosses the Bible Belt, collecting a scrapbook and oral history of various LGBTQ+ people living in the rural margins. The older interviewees—the elders who survived the AIDS crisis and more—are the best and most emotional part. It’s easy to get miffed when people act like the Brooklyn or San Francisco subcultures are the only ones that matter, or like gay and trans people don’t exist in the south except to be persecuted.</description></item><item><title>Never Whistle at Night</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/never-whistle-at-night/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/never-whistle-at-night/</guid><description>As awesome as the cover. I agree with Stephen Graham Jones, who writes the foreword, that the cream of the current horror crop is written by indigenous authors.
“But what feels like an even better explanation for why we tend to like our stories to end like that, with bleeding over, bleeding across, haunting us, it’s that it feels kind of fake and wrong and all too American to throw up walls between what’s real and what’s maybe not real.</description></item><item><title>The Dawn of Everything</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</guid><description>A concept I am on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question.
For example: in trying to locate the so-called “agricultural revolution,” we look only for the traits we expect and overlook anything that doesn’t conform.</description></item><item><title>Always Coming Home</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/always-coming-home/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 12:40:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/always-coming-home/</guid><description>I’ve been saving this one because [[notes/the carrier bag theory of fiction|the Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction]] has been such a foundational text for me, and this is where Ursula, more than ever, puts that theory to practice.
