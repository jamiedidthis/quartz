It’s especially a bummer that for someone purporting to “queer the narrative,” it’s impenetrable to those without the author’s credentials.</description></item><item><title>Symbiotic Planet</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/symbiotic-planet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/symbiotic-planet/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Underland</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/underland/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/underland/</guid><description>For to think in deep time can be a means not of escaping our troubled present, but rather of re-imagining it; countermanding its quick greeds and furies with older, slower stories of making and unmaking.
Three different siren calls for me: geology, linguistics, and [[notes/deep time decenters the human|deep time]].</description></item><item><title>The Dawn of Everything</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</guid><description>A concept I am on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question.
For example: in trying to locate the so-called “agricultural revolution,” we look only for the traits we expect and overlook anything that doesn’t conform.</description></item><item><title>Persuasion</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/persuasion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/persuasion/</guid><description>Persuasion in context Since this was a re-read after [[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]], I’m going to put my relevant highlights from that book here.
The references to Burney in Northanger Abbey date to the late 1790s or very early nineteenth century, certainly no later than 1802 or 1803, because in 1802 Burney traveled to France to assist her French husband in some family business, taking advantage of the short-lived cessation of hostilities between France and Britain.</description></item><item><title>Staying with the Trouble</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/staying-with-the-trouble/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 19:43:57 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/staying-with-the-trouble/</guid><description>Drawing from the Greek roots khthon (earth) and kainos ([[notes/concepts of time|time]]), Haraway coins Chthulucene ( not of Lovecraft origins) as an alternative to the monikers Anthropocene or Capitalocene as labels for these turbulent times.
The Anthropocene marks severe discontinuities; what comes after will not be like what came before.</description></item><item><title>Following the Water</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/following-the-water/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/following-the-water/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Braiding Sweetgrass</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/braiding-sweetgrass/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 14:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/braiding-sweetgrass/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Annals of the Former World</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</guid><description>I’m glad I’m not beyond the age where books I read can change the way I see the world. If that is an age you can reach, I don’t want to. I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.</description></item><item><title>Entangled Life</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/entangled-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/entangled-life/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Hidden Life of Trees</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-hidden-life-of-trees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-hidden-life-of-trees/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
