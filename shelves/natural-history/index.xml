If that is an age you can reach, I don’t want to. I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.</description></item><item><title>Entangled Life</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/entangled-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/entangled-life/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Hidden Life of Trees</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-hidden-life-of-trees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-hidden-life-of-trees/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Following the Water</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/following-the-water/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/following-the-water/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Staying with the Trouble</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/staying-with-the-trouble/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/staying-with-the-trouble/</guid><description>Drawing from the Greek roots khthon (earth) and kainos ([[notes/concepts of time|time]]), Haraway coins Chthulucene ( not of Lovecraft origins) as an alternative to the monikers Anthropocene or Capitalocene as labels for these turbulent times.
The Anthropocene marks severe discontinuities; what comes after will not be like what came before.</description></item><item><title>The Dawn of Everything</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</guid><description>One would do well to read up on Graeber’s [[notes/what&amp;rsquo;s the point if we can&amp;rsquo;t have fun|theory of playfulness]]. I’d add C. Thi Nguyen’s [[notes/playfulness vs epistemic traps|playfulness vs epistemic traps]] too.
A concept I am utterly on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says vastly more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question.</description></item><item><title>Underland</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/underland/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/underland/</guid><description>For to think in deep time can be a means not of escaping our troubled present, but rather of re-imagining it; countermanding its quick greeds and furies with older, slower stories of making and unmaking.
Three different siren calls for me: geology, linguistics, and [[notes/deep time|deep time]].</description></item></channel></rss>
