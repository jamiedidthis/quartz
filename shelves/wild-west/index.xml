It also feels like only half of a whole, so I think that’s part of it too. Will revisit these feelings after [[books/parable of the talents|Parable of the Talents]].</description></item><item><title>Parable of the Talents</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/parable-of-the-talents/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:43:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/parable-of-the-talents/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ducks</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ducks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 22:10:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ducks/</guid><description>Reading this alongside a friend who grew up in Alberta around the oil sands… oof. (Who has also been an internet friend since back in the livejournal/Hark! A Vagrant era.) It’s universal by being so specific. It’s also more dystopian than some dystopias I’ve read, yet done with nuance and empathy.</description></item><item><title>Exodus 20</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/exodus-20/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 13:55:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/exodus-20/</guid><description>If you’re gonna write monster kink, make it a biblically accurate angel. And throw in some searing social/political/theological commentary. This was excellent.</description></item><item><title>China Mountain Zhang</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/china-mountain-zhang/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/china-mountain-zhang/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Annals of the Former World</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</guid><description>I’m glad I’m not beyond the age where books I read can change the way I see the world. If that is an age you can reach, I don’t want to. I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.</description></item></channel></rss>
