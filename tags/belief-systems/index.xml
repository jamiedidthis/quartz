Each creature is directly responsible for the well-being of many beings at many times, but not for all beings at all times, and these ‚Äúoverlap[ping] connections‚Äù sustain a community united not by its identity to itself, but by its complex, mobile, and interrelated differentiations.</description></item><item><title>Any human power can be changed by human beings</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/any-human-power-can-be-changed-by-human-beings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/any-human-power-can-be-changed-by-human-beings/</guid><description> We live in capitalism.

The most widely understood theoretical model of how punishment works comes from behaviorist psychology, which looks at punishment as one kind of conditioning.</description></item><item><title>The most hideous ideologies are the ones we believe without realizing it</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-most-hideous-ideologies-are-the-ones-we-believe-without-realizing-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-most-hideous-ideologies-are-the-ones-we-believe-without-realizing-it/</guid><description>Hey!

I love people, but a lot of them‚Äîmaybe most?‚Äîyearn for their side to acquire absolute power. They seem to believe in the authoritarian school of social change: the only way to create a better world is for a strong central actor to force it on everybody else.</description></item><item><title>The three lies of power</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-three-lies-of-power/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-three-lies-of-power/</guid><description>For all the aspiring authoritarians wanting to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù and force their good ideas on everyone, [[authors/adam mastroianni|Adam Mastroianni]] outlines the wildly delusional three lies of power:

Many circumstances conspire to extinguish scientific discoveries, especially those that cause discomfort about our culture‚Äôs sacred norms.

What induces the symbolic disgust response is defined by prevailing cultural forces. That‚Äôs to say, for the most part we‚Äôve learned to morally loathe whatever it is that we‚Äôve come to do; this information isn‚Äôt genetically inborn but socially acquired.</description></item><item><title>Thinking people are stupid is the gateway drug to worse ideas</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/thinking-people-are-stupid-is-the-gateway-drug-to-worse-ideas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/thinking-people-are-stupid-is-the-gateway-drug-to-worse-ideas/</guid><description>I‚Äôm highly allergic to the idea that other people are fundamentally stupid. It‚Äôs one small, flimsy step away from dehumanizing people completely, and once anyone is dehumanized, that leads to a lot of worse ideas.
If we can go from ‚Äúonly kings and dukes could possibly become less stupid‚Äù to ‚Äúanybody can become less stupid,‚Äù maybe we can make it all the way to ‚Äúpeople aren‚Äôt fundamentally stupid to begin with.</description></item><item><title>Moral dumbfounding is not moral reasoning</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/moral-dumbfounding-is-not-moral-reasoning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 21:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/moral-dumbfounding-is-not-moral-reasoning/</guid><description>Moral judgement and moral reasoning are basically two different processes. People tend to have a knee-jerk reaction for what‚Äôs good or bad, often based more on cultural conditioning, prejudice, or gut feelings than any reasonable morality or ethics. When asked to elaborate, you get ‚Äúmoral dumbfounding,‚Äù moral reasoning made up ex-post facto to justify moral judgement.</description></item><item><title>Who is more deserving</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/who-is-more-deserving/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 15:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/who-is-more-deserving/</guid><description>As if deserving meant anything.

Ideology ‚Üí purity ‚Üí supremacy happens all the time. Or at best, you get tangled up in labels and abstractions, and the arguments thereof.
