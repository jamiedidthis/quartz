Lots of shorthand and emoji feels so probably useless to anybody but me 🤷🏻‍♀️
Ep 1 WWX resurrecting in Jin color robes, lolll—cannot fully appreciate the irony of this the first time around Lan clan using the lure flags he made; already innovating 😭 SZ recognizing Wuji from LWJ playing it in Gusu 😭 (==diegetic Wuji==, “flute”/grass) (ALSO, he would be not realizing he recognizes it from WWX playing it in Burial Mounds) Full moon Btw a-Yuan (愿) means “wishes” and Sizhui (思追) means “miss you and chase you,” so basically SZ is a love letter to WWX from LWJ 😭 Ep 2 Is WWX your dad?</description></item></channel></rss>
