Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time. Any number above a couple of thousand years—fifty thousand, fifty million—will with nearly equal effect awe the imagination to the point of paralysis.</description></item><item><title>Seasonal time</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/seasonal-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/seasonal-time/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Creativity should have fallow days too</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/creativity-should-have-fallow-days-too/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 14:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/creativity-should-have-fallow-days-too/</guid><description>Austin Kleon has written for years about the creative process of chain smoking. It’s never resonated with me; I can’t be that person of work every day even while a project is in progress. It ebbs and flows like the tide, days of rampant blooming interspersed with the fallow days of rootwork, day dreaming, glorious nothingness.</description></item><item><title>Concepts of time</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/concepts-of-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 11:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/concepts-of-time/</guid><description>The Greeks had two different conceptions of time: chronos (quantitative, linear) and kairos (qualitative, nonlinear).
Ancient Indians had a similar conception of time: kala (quantitative) and ritu (qualitative).
[[notes/deep time decenters the human|Deep time]] (also called geological time, cosmological time, or radiological time) involves the time scale of geologic events, which is incomparably vast compared to the time scale of human history.</description></item><item><title>It happens when it’s time</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/it-happens-when-its-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/it-happens-when-its-time/</guid><description>Generally when someone leaves an abusive relationship it happens for the same reason flowers bloom: because it was time. Something just shifts, and suddenly you’re seeing things you weren’t seeing before.
