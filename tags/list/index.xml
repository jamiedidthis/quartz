Propaganda blitzes are fast-moving attacks intended to inflict maximum damage in minimum time. They are:
based on allegations of dramatic new evidence communicated with high emotional intensity and moral outrage apparently supported by an informed corporate media/academic/expert consensus reinforced by damning condemnation of anyone daring even to question the apparent consensus often generated with fortuitous timing characterised by tragicomic moral dissonance Every one of these things, much less the concatenation of all of them, signals red flag, red flag, red flag.</description></item><item><title>Core values</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/core-values/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/core-values/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The relationship abuse checklist</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-relationship-abuse-checklist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-relationship-abuse-checklist/</guid><description>In the years since I read it, I still haven’t come across a better relationship inventory than [[authors/anton fulmen|Anton Fulmen’s]] in [[books/the dominance playbook|The Dominance Playbook]].
