We tend to use amateur pejoratively, to indicate the lack of skill, but the word in French means lover. If you think about it this way:

When the nineteenth-century medicolegal term ‚Äúhomosexuality‚Äù was brought into official Catholic speech, it replaced the eleventh-century theological term ‚Äúsodomy.‚Äù ‚ÄúHomosexuality‚Äù took the place of ‚Äúsodomy‚Äù in the way a substitute teacher takes over a class.</description></item><item><title>Moral dumbfounding is not moral reasoning</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/moral-dumbfounding-is-not-moral-reasoning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2024 21:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/moral-dumbfounding-is-not-moral-reasoning/</guid><description>Moral judgement and moral reasoning are basically two different processes. People tend to have a knee-jerk reaction for what‚Äôs good or bad, often based more on cultural conditioning, prejudice, or gut feelings than any reasonable morality or ethics. When asked to elaborate, you get ‚Äúmoral dumbfounding,‚Äù moral reasoning made up ex-post facto to justify moral judgement.</description></item><item><title>Moral panics and mass hysteria</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/moral-panics-and-mass-hysteria/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/moral-panics-and-mass-hysteria/</guid><description>Imma start collecting moral panics from the past so our current ones sound less wild.

For example:
Hi!
What‚Äôs up?
Fine, how are you?
Not much.
Each person is responding to questions that weren‚Äôt asked, but the script is so familiar and the beats so ingrained that nobody notices.</description></item><item><title>Bibliotropic</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/bibliotropic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 15:23:08 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/bibliotropic/</guid><description>To leans towards a book as flowers leans toward the sun.
I‚Äôm guessing [[authors/jo walton|Jo Walton]] didn‚Äôt coin this one so much as borrow it, but most of the top results in google reference [[books/among others|her use of it]], or at least the SFF community.</description></item><item><title>Vorfreude</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/vorfreude/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 15:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/vorfreude/</guid><description>The German word vorfruede has no English equivalent. It comes from the words vor (‚Äúbefore‚Äù) and Freude (‚Äújoy‚Äù) and means something along the lines of ‚Äújoyful anticipation.‚Äù
Often ‚Äúvorfreude‚Äù is characterized as childish anticipation. It also includes the tension, impatience, and curiosity of anticipating an event.</description></item><item><title>Vocateur</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/vocateur/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 15:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/vocateur/</guid><description>Ha @ [[authors/jo walton|Jo Walton]] describing herself as a vocateur reader on the Ex Urbe Ad Astra podcast! Totally fits because as much as I love her as an author ([[books/lent|Lent]]! [[books/among others|Among Others]]!), I always say Jo is my favorite reader.
I was trying to find out if [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]] coined vocateur in the [[series/terra ignota|Terra Ignota]] series, and the results of just a cursory google search all give her credit for the term.</description></item><item><title>Mitfreude</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mitfreude/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 12:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mitfreude/</guid><description>Mitfreude is feeling joy in another‚Äôs joy.
