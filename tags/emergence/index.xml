(Or insert the desired x here: peace, health, happiness, a better world, etc.)
You don’t stick a seed in hard-packed ground full of thistles and rocks, not provide water or light, and just sit there poking and urging it to grow.</description></item><item><title>Nature is emergent and adaptive</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/nature-is-emergent-and-adaptive/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/nature-is-emergent-and-adaptive/</guid><description>From the macro to the micro, life is constantly creating options. Nature is not fixed and immutable, but emergent and adaptive.
Whether you take the planet as a whole, or the ecosystems at a smaller scale—a forest, a pond, a puddle—life is constantly creating options.</description></item><item><title>Individuality is inseparable from community</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/individuality-is-inseparable-from-community/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/individuality-is-inseparable-from-community/</guid><description>It shouldn’t surprise me anymore that I keep running across taoism when reading about anarchism or indigenous animism, or running across anarchism/animism when reading about the tao. (But it still does, bc I wanna stay childlike like that ☺️)
The principle is that if everything is allowed to go its own way the harmony of the universe will be established, since every process in the world can “do its own thing” only in relation to all others.</description></item><item><title>Language is a network</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/language-is-a-network/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/language-is-a-network/</guid><description>We are not tending language like a garden—its order is emerging from the chaos in a natural way.
When we thought of language like a book, we thought of it as an unruly mess of words that had to be kept in order, like a Victorian gardener constantly retrimming the hedges into spirals and globes.</description></item><item><title>Enshittification</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/enshittification/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/enshittification/</guid><description>Cory Doctorow on the enshittification of TikTok:

The argument here is that once a certain level of complexity is reached, there is a kind of qualitative leap where completely new sorts of physical laws can “emerge”—ones that are premised on, but cannot be reduced to, what came before.</description></item><item><title>It happens when it’s time</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/it-happens-when-its-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/it-happens-when-its-time/</guid><description>Generally when someone leaves an abusive relationship it happens for the same reason flowers bloom: because it was time.
