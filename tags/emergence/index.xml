When we thought of language like a book, we thought of it as an unruly mess of words that had to be kept in order, like a Victorian gardener constantly retrimming the hedges into spirals and globes.</description></item><item><title>Life is constantly creating options</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/life-is-constantly-creating-options/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/life-is-constantly-creating-options/</guid><description>From the macro to the micro, life is constantly creating options.
