The more we feel, the less we resist feeling, which leads to states of chronic stress and inflammation.
In 2017, positive psychology researchers published findings that suggested emodiversity—which they defined as “the breadth and relative abundance of emotions that individuals experience”—is more significant to wellness than happiness.</description></item><item><title>Diversity provides stability</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</guid><description>In nature, diversity provides ecological stability. Monocropping/monoculture leads to a very precarious existence, prone to disease, collapse, and death. But the more diverse the ecosystem, the more robust and healthy it is.

That only leads to more authoritarianism, even if the despots briefly agree with us. Instead, thinking in ecosystems changes both the question and the process entirely.
The better way to pose this question is to tack a few extra letters onto the front: how should the ecosystem work?</description></item></channel></rss>
