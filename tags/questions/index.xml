In the Pentecostal tradition that I grew up in (and escaped from), faith healing often happens in a highly charged environment, with lots of prayer (meditation), and emotional catharsis.</description></item><item><title>Is fear of groupthink another pursuit of purity?</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/is-fear-of-groupthink-another-pursuit-of-purity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/is-fear-of-groupthink-another-pursuit-of-purity/</guid><description>Is ridding yourself of all “groupthink” another pursuit of purity? Does the quest for purity only happen within the groupthink/ideology? Are there elements of “groupthink” that are merely the human traits as a communal species? Like censorship, there has never been some ideal state without it, only existing to various healthy or toxic degrees?</description></item><item><title>Play could be the basis of physical reality</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/play-could-be-the-basis-of-physical-reality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/play-could-be-the-basis-of-physical-reality/</guid><description>The principle of play repeats so often in nature, it’s worth asking whether it’s the basis of physical reality. That’s not as wild an assertion as it seems, and even more plausible and less inconsistent than our image of a mindless robotic universe.

The phenomenon of so-called culture-bound syndromes, which more recently have come to be known as “cultural syndromes,” or sometimes, “cultural idioms of distress.</description></item><item><title>Self-organizing systems of vast complexity are the way of the world</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</guid><description>We get in trouble when we try to impose external, hierarchical order on ourselves—much like how monoculture fails to thrive, and instead entangled ecosystems are key.
If something as complex as a human body is a self-organizing system, could you not scale it up and infer that all of humanity is a self-organizing system as much as mycelia are?</description></item></channel></rss>
