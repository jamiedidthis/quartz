It‚Äôs not a race to the top for dominance, but a web of interdependencies, that depends on even the supposedly ‚Äúweakest‚Äù trees for survival.

Does the quest for purity only happen within the groupthink/ideology? Are there elements of ‚Äúgroupthink‚Äù that are merely the human traits as a communal species?
