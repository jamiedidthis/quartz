I call Obama‚Äôs particular brand of establishment sycophancy Nice Guy Fascism. It‚Äôs just like regular fascism, enabling the brutal dominion of a few depraved and bloodthirsty tyrants, except you get to look like a nice guy while you‚Äôre participating in it.</description></item><item><title>The most hideous ideologies are the ones we believe without realizing it</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-most-hideous-ideologies-are-the-ones-we-believe-without-realizing-it/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-most-hideous-ideologies-are-the-ones-we-believe-without-realizing-it/</guid><description>Hey! Here‚Äôs a thought! Do not yearn for the authoritarian school of social change! Do not force your ideas on anyone else! üíÄ
I love people, but a lot of them‚Äîmaybe most?‚Äîyearn for their side to acquire absolute power. They seem to believe in the authoritarian school of social change: the only way to create a better world is for a strong central actor to force it on everybody else.</description></item><item><title>US exceptionalism is abusive narcissism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/us-exceptionalism-is-abusive-narcissism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/us-exceptionalism-is-abusive-narcissism/</guid><description>Exceptionalism has come to represent superiority in the minds and hearts of Americans, and belief in their economic, military and ideological supremacy is what has motivated successive US governments to shape the world in their ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù image with no regard for the destruction left in the wake of their exceptional hegemony.</description></item><item><title>Is fear of groupthink another pursuit of purity?</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/is-fear-of-groupthink-another-pursuit-of-purity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/is-fear-of-groupthink-another-pursuit-of-purity/</guid><description>Is ridding yourself of all ‚Äúgroupthink‚Äù another pursuit of purity? Does the quest for purity only happen within the groupthink/ideology? Are there elements of ‚Äúgroupthink‚Äù that are merely the human traits as a communal species? Like censorship, there has never been some ideal state without it, only existing to various healthy or toxic degrees?</description></item><item><title>Forests disprove survival of the fittest</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</guid><description>In a forest, well-being depends on community and diversity. It‚Äôs not a race to the top for dominance, but a web of interdependencies, that depends on even the supposedly ‚Äúweakest‚Äù trees for survival.
It‚Äôs not survival of the fittest‚Äîtheir well-being depends on community. When supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well.</description></item><item><title>Institutional betrayal</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/institutional-betrayal/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 15:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/institutional-betrayal/</guid><description>Institutional betrayal is when an institution causes harm (by action or inaction) to anyone who trusts or depends on them. Red flags include strict membership requirements (the military, elite sports), prestige or power differentials (caregivers v. patients, clergy v. parishioners), and rigid priorities, like extreme efforts to protect the reputation of the organization.</description></item><item><title>Don‚Äôt pledge allegiance to any one ideology</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/dont-pledge-allegiance-to-any-one-ideology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/dont-pledge-allegiance-to-any-one-ideology/</guid><description>Make a patchwork quilt! That‚Äôs so much more fun, effective, and reliable than devoting yourself to any one ideology.
Ideology ‚Üí purity ‚Üí supremacy happens all the time. Or at best, you get tangled up in labels and abstractions, and the arguments thereof.
The closest ideologies to my own values are an overlapping hodgepodge of taoism, anarchism, and indigenous animism, with a lil‚Äô sprinkling of socialism, etc.</description></item><item><title>Fascism can‚Äôt survive long term</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/fascism-cant-survive-long-term/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/fascism-cant-survive-long-term/</guid><description>How‚Äôs this for a shower thought: fascism keeps arising because fascism keeps getting defeated. It can‚Äôt survive long-term because it enforces so much conformity that it collapses. Diversity is stability.
previously: every ecologist knows that [[notes/diversity provides stability|diversity provides stability]] see also: [[notes/think in ecosystems, not systems|think in ecosystems, not systems]] (systems = authoritarian hierarchy, ecosystems = diversity and decentralized collaboration)</description></item></channel></rss>
