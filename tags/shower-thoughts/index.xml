Does the quest for purity only happen within the groupthink/ideology? Are there elements of “groupthink” that are merely the human traits as a communal species? Like censorship, there has never been some ideal state without it, only existing to various healthy or toxic degrees?</description></item><item><title>Self-organizing systems of vast complexity are the way of the world</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</guid><description>We get in trouble when we try to impose external, hierarchical order on ourselves—much like how monoculture fails to thrive, and instead entangled ecosystems are key.
If something as complex as a human body is a self-organizing system, could you not scale it up and infer that all of humanity is a self-organizing system as much as mycelia are?</description></item><item><title>Creativity should have fallow days too</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/creativity-should-have-fallow-days-too/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 14:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/creativity-should-have-fallow-days-too/</guid><description>Austin Kleon has written for years about the creative process of chain smoking. It’s never resonated with me; I can’t be that person of work every day even while a project is in progress. It ebbs and flows like the tide, days of rampant blooming interspersed with the fallow days of rootwork, day dreaming, glorious nothingness.</description></item><item><title>Fascism can’t survive long term</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/fascism-cant-survive-long-term/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/fascism-cant-survive-long-term/</guid><description>How’s this for a shower thought: fascism keeps arising because fascism keeps getting defeated. It can’t survive long-term because it enforces so much conformity that it collapses. Diversity is stability.
previously: every ecologist knows that [[notes/diversity provides stability|diversity provides stability]] see also: [[notes/think in ecosystems, not systems|think in ecosystems, not systems]] (systems = authoritarian hierarchy, ecosystems = diversity and decentralized collaboration)</description></item></channel></rss>
