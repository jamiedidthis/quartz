Does the quest for purity only happen within the groupthink/ideology? Are there elements of “groupthink” that are merely the human traits as a communal species? Like censorship, there has never been some ideal state without it, only existing to various healthy or toxic degrees?</description></item><item><title>Self-organizing systems of vast complexity are the way of the world</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</guid><description>We get in trouble when we try to impose external, hierarchical order on ourselves—much like how monoculture fails to thrive, and instead entangled ecosystems are key.
If you think chaos is the only result of a non-hierarchal system, your own body disproves it. Try to get your mind to tell your lungs to breathe, your heart to beat, your stomach to digest, your skin to sweat, your colon to poop.</description></item><item><title>Creativity should have fallow days too</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/creativity-should-have-fallow-days-too/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 14:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/creativity-should-have-fallow-days-too/</guid><description>Austin Kleon has written for years about the creative process of chain smoking. It’s never resonated with me; I can’t be that person of work every day even while a project is in progress. It ebbs and flows like the tide, days of rampant blooming interspersed with the fallow days of rootwork, day dreaming, glorious nothingness.</description></item><item><title>Fascism can’t survive long term</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/fascism-cant-survive-long-term/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/fascism-cant-survive-long-term/</guid><description>How’s this for a shower thought: fascism keeps arising because fascism keeps getting defeated. It can’t survive long-term because it enforces so much conformity that it collapses. Diversity is stability.
previously: every ecologist knows that [[notes/diversity provides stability|diversity provides stability]] see also: [[notes/think in ecosystems, not systems|think in ecosystems, not systems]] (systems = authoritarian hierarchy, ecosystems = diversity and decentralized collaboration)</description></item></channel></rss>
