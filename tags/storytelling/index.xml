It’s maddening, it’s challenging. It’s delightful. It’s a heady rush of satisfaction when the pieces start to click. It’s completely different from worldbuilding that stays dense, illogical, and nonsensical. A lazy author not even bothering to build a puzzle is detectable at first glance from the author you won’t be able to understand until the second read.</description></item><item><title>We are doing exactly what the fish are doing</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-doing-exactly-what-the-fish-are-doing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-doing-exactly-what-the-fish-are-doing/</guid><description>[[authors/david graeber|David Graeber]] says that when he taught at Yale, he would assign a reading of the following Taoist story, offering an automatic “A” to any student who could tell him why the last line made sense.

Ed. note: just me copying and annotating this text in full, it’s that brilliant.
In the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable.</description></item><item><title>Science fiction futures</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/science-fiction-futures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 14:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/science-fiction-futures/</guid><description>I would call our work to change the world “science fictional behavior”—being concerned with the way our actions and beliefs now, today, will shape the future, tomorrow, the next generations.
