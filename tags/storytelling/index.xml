Ed. note: just me copying and annotating this text in full, it’s that brilliant.
In the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable.</description></item><item><title>Science fiction futures</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/science-fiction-futures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 14:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/science-fiction-futures/</guid><description>Visionary science fiction and fantasy is a way to practice the future.
I would call our work to change the world “science fictional behavior”—being concerned with the way our actions and beliefs now, today, will shape the future, tomorrow, the next generations.
Science fiction is simply a way to practice the future together.</description></item><item><title>Healthy stories are fluid, not fixed</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/healthy-stories-are-fluid-not-fixed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 14:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/healthy-stories-are-fluid-not-fixed/</guid><description>We often forget that our storytelling is rooted in millennia of oral tradition. [[notes/collective folk texts|Collaborative, mutable, fluid, living narratives]] that changed to suit different ecosystems and social scenarios.
Written tales are more “permanent,” but they have a harder time evolving. So we’ve traded (a false sense of) permanence for the complex and evolving ([[notes/the culturally bound notion of authorship|and communal]]) narrative lifeforms.</description></item><item><title>Mosaic novel</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mosaic-novel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mosaic-novel/</guid><description>[[authors/jo walton|Jo Walton]], in the foreward for [[books/china mountain zhang|China Mountain Zhang]], discusses the difference between books of interconnected short stories vs. mosaic novels.

It’s maddening, it’s challenging. It’s delightful. It’s a heady rush of satisfaction when the pieces start to click. It’s completely different from worldbuilding that stays dense, illogical, and nonsensical. A lazy author not even bothering to build a puzzle is detectable at first glance from the author you won’t be able to understand until the second read.</description></item></channel></rss>
