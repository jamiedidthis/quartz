Each creature is directly responsible for the well-being of many beings at many times, but not for all beings at all times, and these “overlap[ping] connections” sustain a community united not by its identity to itself, but by its complex, mobile, and interrelated differentiations.</description></item><item><title>At every level we are a web of interdependencies</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</guid><description>When we talk about being inseparable from the universe, or an animistic view of the world, it’s not uniformity, conformity, or a primordial soup where everything is nothing and nothing is everything. From the macro to the micro, it’s very much a web of interdependencies.</description></item><item><title>Individuality is inseparable from community</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/individuality-is-inseparable-from-community/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/individuality-is-inseparable-from-community/</guid><description>It shouldn’t surprise me anymore that I keep running across taoism when reading about anarchism or indigenous animism, or running across anarchism/animism when reading about the tao. (But it still does, bc I wanna stay childlike like that ☺️)
The principle is that if everything is allowed to go its own way the harmony of the universe will be established, since every process in the world can “do its own thing” only in relation to all others.</description></item><item><title>Animism is a dynamic, relational structure</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/animism-is-a-dynamic-relational-structure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 14:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/animism-is-a-dynamic-relational-structure/</guid><description>Animism is a belief in the “animation of all nature” (E. B. Tylor), where “the world and its various powers are neither good nor bad… but open, efficacious, and above all, relational.” (Graham Harvey)
Far from abolishing or preventing distinctions, then, this sort of animacy produces differences locally and interactively.</description></item></channel></rss>
