If I am continuous with the universe, if the physics of my body is the same as the physics of everything else, then I have the same relation to the outside world as to that much of my own body which I can see.</description></item><item><title>Create the conditions necessary for change</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/create-the-conditions-necessary-for-change/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/create-the-conditions-necessary-for-change/</guid><description>I’m toying with the idea of how you nurture the conditions for change, not forcing change itself. (Or insert the desired x here: peace, health, happiness, a better world, etc.)
You don’t stick a seed in hard-packed ground full of thistles and rocks, not provide water or light, and just sit there poking and urging it to grow.</description></item><item><title>Diversity provides stability</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</guid><description>In nature, diversity provides ecological stability. Monocropping/monoculture leads to a very precarious existence, prone to disease, collapse, and death. But the more diverse the ecosystem, the more robust and healthy it is.
Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Fungi are also dependent on very stable conditions and support other species underground, protecting them from complete collapse and ensuring one species of tree doesn’t dominate.</description></item><item><title>Nature is emergent and adaptive</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/nature-is-emergent-and-adaptive/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/nature-is-emergent-and-adaptive/</guid><description>From the macro to the micro, life is constantly creating options. Nature is not fixed and immutable, but emergent and adaptive.
Whether you take the planet as a whole, or the ecosystems at a smaller scale—a forest, a pond, a puddle—life is constantly creating options.</description></item><item><title>To dominate is to destroy</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/to-dominate-is-to-destroy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/to-dominate-is-to-destroy/</guid><description>The Taoists are saying, then, that seen as a whole the universe is a harmony or symbiosis of patterns which cannot exist without each other. However, when it is looked at section by section we find conflict. The biological world is a mutual eating society in which every species is the prey of another.</description></item><item><title>At every level we are a web of interdependencies</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</guid><description>When we talk about being inseparable from the universe, or an animistic view of the world, it’s not uniformity, conformity, or a primordial soup where everything is nothing and nothing is everything. From the macro to the micro, it’s very much a web of interdependencies.</description></item><item><title>Self-organizing systems of vast complexity are the way of the world</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</guid><description>We get in trouble when we try to impose external, hierarchical order on ourselves—much like how monoculture fails to thrive, and instead entangled ecosystems are key.
If you think chaos is the only result of a non-hierarchal system, your own body disproves it. Try to get your mind to tell your lungs to breathe, your heart to beat, your stomach to digest, your skin to sweat, your colon to poop.</description></item><item><title>Fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/fear-is-a-natural-reaction-to-moving-closer-to-the-truth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/fear-is-a-natural-reaction-to-moving-closer-to-the-truth/</guid><description>It’s amazing how much we fear fear, when there is no more universal experience. If we can get that little bit of space between it, allow the fear to exist and listen to it, underneath that is something very soft and tender and honest, the core of what it means to be alive.</description></item><item><title>Forests disprove survival of the fittest</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</guid><description>In a forest, well-being depends on community and diversity. It’s not a race to the top for dominance, but a web of interdependencies, that depends on even the supposedly “weakest” trees for survival.
It’s not survival of the fittest—their well-being depends on community. When supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well.</description></item><item><title>Play could be the basis of physical reality</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/play-could-be-the-basis-of-physical-reality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/play-could-be-the-basis-of-physical-reality/</guid><description>The principle of play repeats so often in nature, it’s worth asking whether it’s the basis of physical reality. That’s not as wild an assertion as it seems, and even more plausible and less inconsistent than our image of a mindless robotic universe.
I don’t deny that what I’ve presented so far is a savage simplification of very complicated issues.</description></item><item><title>Emergence occurs at a certain level of complexity</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emergence-occurs-at-a-certain-level-of-complexity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emergence-occurs-at-a-certain-level-of-complexity/</guid><description>Faced with the puzzle of how life might emerge from dead matter or how conscious beings might evolve from microbes, philosophers of science have developed the theory of emergence.
The argument here is that once a certain level of complexity is reached, there is a kind of qualitative leap where completely new sorts of physical laws can “emerge”—ones that are premised on, but cannot be reduced to, what came before.</description></item><item><title>Deep time decenters the human</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/deep-time-decenters-the-human/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/deep-time-decenters-the-human/</guid><description>Deep time, coined by [[authors/john mcphee|John McPhee]] in [[books/annals of the former world|Basin and Range]], is a concept of geological time so vast it completely annihilates the scale of human history.
Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time. Any number above a couple of thousand years—fifty thousand, fifty million—will with nearly equal effect awe the imagination to the point of paralysis.</description></item><item><title>Our greatest responsibility is to be good ancestors</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/our-greatest-responsibility-is-to-be-good-ancestors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 14:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/our-greatest-responsibility-is-to-be-good-ancestors/</guid><description>Jonas Salk, the mid-20th-century virologist, coined the question-turned-maxim, “ Are We Being Good Ancestors?” He called it humanity’s greatest responsibility, and said that we are not only a product of evolution, but its instruments as well.
If we want to be good ancestors, we should show future generations how we coped with an age of great change and great crises.</description></item><item><title>Animism is a dynamic, relational structure</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/animism-is-a-dynamic-relational-structure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 14:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/animism-is-a-dynamic-relational-structure/</guid><description>Animism is a belief in the “animation of all nature” (E. B. Tylor), where “the world and its various powers are neither good nor bad… but open, efficacious, and above all, relational.” (Graham Harvey)
Far from abolishing or preventing distinctions, then, this sort of animacy produces differences locally and interactively.</description></item><item><title>It happens when it’s time</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/it-happens-when-its-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/it-happens-when-its-time/</guid><description>Generally when someone leaves an abusive relationship it happens for the same reason flowers bloom: because it was time. Something just shifts, and suddenly you’re seeing things you weren’t seeing before. You start noticing patterns, noticing manipulations, noticing the malice in the abuser’s face that you’d previously compartmentalized away from seeing.</description></item><item><title>It’s difficult to control something that wiggles</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/its-difficult-to-control-something-that-wiggles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/its-difficult-to-control-something-that-wiggles/</guid><description>It’s notoriously difficult to get control over something that wiggles. A fish, a cat, a worm, a snake—the more wiggly, the more fluid, the less it can be controlled, contained, or even measured.
When you want control over something that wiggles, it’s pretty difficult. A fish is extremely wiggly.</description></item><item><title>People aren’t stupid</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/people-arent-stupid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/people-arent-stupid/</guid><description>Why are we so quick to dismiss other people as stupid? (While at the same time being impressed by a very, very limited, exorbitantly inefficient so-called artificial intelligence?) Humans perform astounding feats of intelligence just by existing every day, so who benefits when we bash ourselves and others for stupidity?</description></item></channel></rss>
