If we can get that little bit of space between it, allow the fear to exist and listen to it, underneath that is something very soft and tender and honest, the core of what it means to be alive.</description></item><item><title>At every level we are a web of interdependencies</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</guid><description>When we talk about being inseparable from the universe, or an animistic view of the world, it’s not uniformity, conformity, or a primordial soup where everything is nothing and nothing is everything. From the macro to the micro, it’s very much a web of interdependencies.</description></item><item><title>Diversity provides stability</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</guid><description>In nature, diversity provides ecological stability. Monocropping/monoculture leads to a very precarious existence, prone to disease, collapse, and death. But the more diverse the ecosystem, the more robust and healthy it is.
Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Fungi are also dependent on very stable conditions and support other species underground, protecting them from complete collapse and ensuring one species of tree doesn’t dominate.</description></item><item><title>Forests disprove survival of the fittest</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</guid><description>In a forest, well-being depends on community and diversity. It’s not a race to the top for dominance, but a web of interdependencies, that depends on even the supposedly “weakest” trees for survival.
It’s not survival of the fittest—their well-being depends on community. When supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well.</description></item><item><title>Life is constantly creating options</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/life-is-constantly-creating-options/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/life-is-constantly-creating-options/</guid><description>From the macro to the micro, life is constantly creating options. Nature is not fixed and immutable, but emergent and adaptive.
Whether you take the planet as a whole, or the ecosystems at a smaller scale—a forest, a pond, a puddle—life is constantly creating options.</description></item><item><title>Play could be the basis of physical reality</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/play-could-be-the-basis-of-physical-reality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/play-could-be-the-basis-of-physical-reality/</guid><description>The principle of play repeats so often in nature, it’s worth asking whether it’s the basis of physical reality. That’s not as wild an assertion as it seems, and even more plausible and less inconsistent than our image of a mindless robotic universe.
I don’t deny that what I’ve presented so far is a savage simplification of very complicated issues.</description></item><item><title>Self-organizing systems of vast complexity are the way of the world</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/self-organizing-systems-of-vast-complexity-are-the-way-of-the-world/</guid><description>We get in trouble when we try to impose external, hierarchical order on ourselves—much like how monoculture fails to thrive, and instead entangled ecosystems are key.
If something as complex as a human body is a self-organizing system, could you not scale it up and infer that all of humanity is a self-organizing system as much as mycelia are?</description></item><item><title>Emergence occurs at a certain level of complexity</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emergence-occurs-at-a-certain-level-of-complexity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emergence-occurs-at-a-certain-level-of-complexity/</guid><description>Faced with the puzzle of how life might emerge from dead matter or how conscious beings might evolve from microbes, philosophers of science have developed the theory of emergence.
The argument here is that once a certain level of complexity is reached, there is a kind of qualitative leap where completely new sorts of physical laws can “emerge”—ones that are premised on, but cannot be reduced to, what came before.</description></item><item><title>Deep time decenters the human</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/deep-time-decenters-the-human/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/deep-time-decenters-the-human/</guid><description>Deep time, coined by [[authors/john mcphee|John McPhee]] in [[books/annals of the former world|Basin and Range]], is a concept of geological time so vast it completely annihilates the scale of human history.
Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time. Any number above a couple of thousand years—fifty thousand, fifty million—will with nearly equal effect awe the imagination to the point of paralysis.</description></item><item><title>Our greatest responsibility is to be good ancestors</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/our-greatest-responsibility-is-to-be-good-ancestors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 14:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/our-greatest-responsibility-is-to-be-good-ancestors/</guid><description>Jonas Salk, the mid-20th-century virologist, coined the question-turned-maxim, “ Are We Being Good Ancestors?” He called it humanity’s greatest responsibility, and said that we are not only a product of evolution, but its instruments as well.
If we want to be good ancestors, we should show future generations how we coped with an age of great change and great crises.</description></item><item><title>Animism is a dynamic, relational structure</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/animism-is-a-dynamic-relational-structure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 14:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/animism-is-a-dynamic-relational-structure/</guid><description>Animism is a belief in the “animation of all nature” (E. B. Tylor), where “the world and its various powers are neither good nor bad… but open, efficacious, and above all, relational.” (Graham Harvey)
Far from abolishing or preventing distinctions, then, this sort of animacy produces differences locally and interactively.</description></item><item><title>It’s difficult to control something that wiggles</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/its-difficult-to-control-something-that-wiggles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/its-difficult-to-control-something-that-wiggles/</guid><description>It’s notoriously difficult to get control over something that wiggles. A fish, a cat, a worm, a snake—the more wiggly, the more fluid, the less it can be controlled, contained, or even measured.
When you want control over something that wiggles, it’s pretty difficult. A fish is extremely wiggly.</description></item><item><title>People aren’t stupid</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/people-arent-stupid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/people-arent-stupid/</guid><description>Why are we so quick to dismiss other people as stupid? (While at the same time being impressed by a very, very limited, exorbitantly inefficient so-called artificial intelligence?) Humans perform astounding feats of intelligence just by existing every day, so who benefits when we bash ourselves and others for stupidity?</description></item></channel></rss>
