It’s not just about cooperation as a means to an end though—Kropotkin posits that cooperation is a form of pleasure and social play in itself.</description></item><item><title>Diversity provides stability</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</guid><description>In nature, diversity provides ecological stability. Monocropping/monoculture leads to a very precarious existence, prone to disease, collapse, and death. But the more diverse the ecosystem, the more robust and healthy it is.
Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Fungi are also dependent on very stable conditions and support other species underground, protecting them from complete collapse and ensuring one species of tree doesn’t dominate.</description></item><item><title>Forests disprove survival of the fittest</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</guid><description>In a forest, well-being depends on community and diversity. It’s not a race to the top for dominance, but a web of interdependencies, that depends on even the supposedly “weakest” trees for survival.
It’s not survival of the fittest—their well-being depends on community. When supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well.</description></item><item><title>The limits of the individual are porous</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-limits-of-the-individual-are-porous/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-limits-of-the-individual-are-porous/</guid><description>As a fan of pro cycling, one of the most amazing things is watching the peloton guide along the tarmac at breathtaking speeds, a living organism that is unquestionably more than the sum of its parts.1
Its cohesion is so real that the limits of the individual are porous.</description></item><item><title>Think in ecosystems, not systems</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/think-in-ecosystems-not-systems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/think-in-ecosystems-not-systems/</guid><description>When we want to change the system, we’re still thinking in terms of systems. That only leads to more authoritarianism, even if the despots briefly agree with us. Instead, thinking in ecosystems changes both the question and the process entirely.
The better way to pose this question is to tack a few extra letters onto the front: how should the ecosystem work?</description></item><item><title>We are collaborative compound organisms</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-collaborative-compound-organisms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-collaborative-compound-organisms/</guid><description>Humans are not solitary beings, but collaborative compound organisms, coordinating the world together.
Yes, we are beginning to encounter ourselves—not always comfortably or pleasantly—as multi-species beings already partaking in timescales that are fabulously more complex than the onwards driving version of history many of us still imagine ourselves to inhabit.</description></item><item><title>We exist only in relationship to others</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-exist-only-in-relationship-to-others/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-exist-only-in-relationship-to-others/</guid><description>We cannot exist apart from each other. Everything is relative in the sense that my existence is not separate from yours.
We exist only in relationship to others. Our actions can be described only in their context. My existing requires you, and so forth. We are not separate, we define each other.</description></item><item><title>The internet is a rhizome</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-internet-is-a-rhizome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 15:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-internet-is-a-rhizome/</guid><description>The internet is not a textbook, or even a wiki, or any kind of single, linear, finite entity. The internet is a rhizome.
When we thought of language as a book, we thought of it as linear and finite. A book can only have so many pages, so you have to decide what to keep in, what to fence out, and how to order what remains.</description></item></channel></rss>
