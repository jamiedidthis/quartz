Our impulse to control nations, to control each other, to control life itself.</description></item><item><title>Diversity provides stability</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/diversity-provides-stability/</guid><description>In nature, diversity provides ecological stability. Monocropping/monoculture leads to a very precarious existence, prone to disease, collapse, and death. But the more diverse the ecosystem, the more robust and healthy it is.
Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Fungi are also dependent on very stable conditions and support other species underground, protecting them from complete collapse and ensuring one species of tree doesn’t dominate.</description></item><item><title>Think in ecosystems, not systems</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/think-in-ecosystems-not-systems/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/think-in-ecosystems-not-systems/</guid><description>When we want to change the system, we’re still thinking in terms of systems. That only leads to more authoritarianism, even if the despots briefly agree with us. ([[notes/nice guy fascism is still fascism|Nice guy fascism is still fascism]].) Instead, thinking in ecosystems changes both the question and the process entirely.</description></item><item><title>At every level we are a web of interdependencies</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/at-every-level-we-are-a-web-of-interdependencies/</guid><description>When we talk about being inseparable from the universe, or an animistic view of the world, it’s not uniformity, conformity, or a primordial soup where everything is nothing and nothing is everything. From the macro to the micro, it’s very much a web of interdependencies.</description></item><item><title>Individuality is inseparable from community</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/individuality-is-inseparable-from-community/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/individuality-is-inseparable-from-community/</guid><description>It shouldn’t surprise me anymore that I keep running across taoism when reading about anarchism or indigenous animism, or running across anarchism/animism when reading about the tao. (But it still does, bc I wanna stay childlike like that ☺️)
The principle is that if everything is allowed to go its own way the harmony of the universe will be established, since every process in the world can “do its own thing” only in relation to all others.</description></item><item><title>The principle of mutual arising</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-principle-of-mutual-arising/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-principle-of-mutual-arising/</guid><description>It is basic to the Taoist view of the world that every thing-event (shì 事 or wù 物) is what it is only in relation to all others. The earth, and every tiniest thing upon it, inevitably “goes-with” the sun, moon, and stars. It needs them just as much as it needs, and consists of, its own elements.</description></item><item><title>We are making ourselves up as we go</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-making-ourselves-up-as-we-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 02:01:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-making-ourselves-up-as-we-go/</guid><description>The current cultural orthodoxy, often formulated or short-handed as “stay in your lane,” postulates that a writer ought to remain centered in their own community, to write from their own and their community’s experience: to stay home. But Ursula argued that those places, those points of origin, home and community, are themselves acts of the creative imagination.</description></item><item><title>Cooperation is a form of pleasure and play</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/cooperation-is-a-form-of-pleasure-and-play/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/cooperation-is-a-form-of-pleasure-and-play/</guid><description>An alternative school of Darwinism emerged in Russia emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change—see [[books/mutual aid|Mutual Aid]] by [[authors/pyotr kropotkin|Pyotr Kropotkin]]. It’s not just about cooperation as a means to an end though—Kropotkin posits that cooperation is a form of pleasure and social play in itself.</description></item><item><title>We exist only in relationship to others</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-exist-only-in-relationship-to-others/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-exist-only-in-relationship-to-others/</guid><description>We cannot exist apart from each other. Everything is relative in the sense that my existence is not separate from yours.
We exist only in relationship to others. Our actions can be described only in their context. My existing requires you, and so forth. We are not separate, we define each other.</description></item><item><title>Forests disprove survival of the fittest</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/forests-disprove-survival-of-the-fittest/</guid><description>In a forest, well-being depends on community and diversity. It’s not a race to the top for dominance, but a web of interdependencies, that depends on even the supposedly “weakest” trees for survival.
It’s not survival of the fittest—their well-being depends on community. When supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well.</description></item><item><title>The limits of the individual are porous</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-limits-of-the-individual-are-porous/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-limits-of-the-individual-are-porous/</guid><description>As a fan of pro cycling, one of the most amazing things is watching the peloton guide along the tarmac at breathtaking speeds, a living organism that is unquestionably more than the sum of its parts.1
Its cohesion is so real that the limits of the individual are porous.</description></item><item><title>We are collaborative compound organisms</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-collaborative-compound-organisms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/we-are-collaborative-compound-organisms/</guid><description>Humans are not solitary beings, but collaborative compound organisms, coordinating the world together.
Yes, we are beginning to encounter ourselves—not always comfortably or pleasantly—as multi-species beings already partaking in timescales that are fabulously more complex than the onwards driving version of history many of us still imagine ourselves to inhabit.</description></item><item><title>The internet is a rhizome</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-internet-is-a-rhizome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 15:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-internet-is-a-rhizome/</guid><description>The internet is not a textbook, or even a wiki, or any kind of single, linear, finite entity. The internet is a rhizome.
When we thought of language as a book, we thought of it as linear and finite. A book can only have so many pages, so you have to decide what to keep in, what to fence out, and how to order what remains.</description></item><item><title>You’re only powerless if you stand alone</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/youre-only-powerless-if-you-stand-alone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/youre-only-powerless-if-you-stand-alone/</guid><description>We’ve all got a grain of sand’s worth of influence over our world. The historically unprecedented democratization of information and our ability to network and communicate like never before has given us all a grain of sand’s worth of power to open eyes and win hearts and minds over to a more revolutionary worldview.</description></item></channel></rss>
