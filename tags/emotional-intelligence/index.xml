But with emotions, it’s not always clear who “owns” them. I’ve woken up heavy with the boulder of my grandmother’s grief on my chest, breathed deeply while sweating from the fire of my mother’s rage, and I could say, “That’s theirs, not mine,” if I wanted to, but what good would that do?</description></item><item><title>The boundary is a meeting place</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-boundary-is-a-meeting-place/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 23:09:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-boundary-is-a-meeting-place/</guid><description>From [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]], [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]]:
The image asks us to consider that as much as a boundary is a limit, it’s also a meeting place. A place where we identify and name what we can and cannot bring, and where we locate our edges in relationships with others.</description></item><item><title>The righting reflex</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-righting-reflex/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 23:09:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-righting-reflex/</guid><description>From [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]], [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]]:
The primary task in all healing relationships—such as that between a therapist and client—is to listen deeply. Conversely, traumatic relationships are ones in which people consistently deny, overlook, and avoid each other’s truths.
I first learned of exquisite empathy as a graduate student seeking ways to cope with the overwhelming grief and anguish I was bearing witness to as an intern at a community mental health agency in an under-resourced community.</description></item><item><title>Emodiversity</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emodiversity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emodiversity/</guid><description>From [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]], [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]]:
In 2017, positive psychology researchers published findings that suggested emodiversity—which they defined as “the breadth and relative abundance of emotions that individuals experience”—is more significant to wellness than happiness. When they asked 175 adults between the ages of forty and fifty to record their positive and negative emotions over thirty days, they discovered that those who reported a broader range of emotions had less inflammation, a biological process that has been linked to both early morbidity and mortality, but also to emotional states.</description></item><item><title>The importance of anger</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-importance-of-anger/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-importance-of-anger/</guid><description>From [[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]], [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]]:
Validating fury in ourselves and others isn’t simply a means to an end of making it go away—==if your goal is to squash it, you’re not really validating anything.== Evolutionary psychology researchers have suggested a thing called ==the recalibration theory of anger==, which suggests that anger evolved to help us increase our social bargaining power and ensure that we demand better deals for ourselves when we’ve either been slighted or might be again.</description></item><item><title>Vorfreude</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/vorfreude/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 15:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/vorfreude/</guid><description>The German word vorfruede has no English equivalent. It comes from the words vor (“before”) and Freude (“joy”) and means something along the lines of “joyful anticipation.”
Often “vorfreude” is characterized as childish anticipation. It also includes the tension, impatience, and curiosity of anticipating an event.</description></item><item><title>The trust checklist</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-trust-checklist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 15:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/the-trust-checklist/</guid><description>Trust is more of a cognitive assessment than an emotion. Distrust is when you feel “what is important to me is not safe with this person.” That lack of safety makes authenticity and vulnerability difficult for fear of betrayal (rightly so!).
In [[books/atlas of the heart|Atlas of the Heart]], [[authors/brené brown|Brené Brown]] lists seven specific trustworthy behaviors:</description></item><item><title>Mitfreude</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mitfreude/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 12:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/mitfreude/</guid><description>Mitfreude is feeling joy in another’s joy. The opposite of schadenfreude, where pleasure is derived from another’s misfortune.
Coined by Nietzsche in 1878,1 it originates in the German language, mit (“with”) + Freude (“joy”).
First encountered in [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]]’s essay on anime and manga, A Mitfreude of Anime and Manga’s Relationship with Anglophone Science Fiction), where she defines it as the joy of sharing joy with friends.</description></item><item><title>Emotional identification</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emotional-identification/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/emotional-identification/</guid><description>Broadly speaking, we experience three different kinds of emotions in our brains: reactive, routine, and reflective emotions.
Reactive emotions are primitive, hardwired, and innate emotions, such as fear and defensive rage, produced in response to a perceived threat. They energize us for fight-and-flight and live in our limbic system.</description></item><item><title>Compersion</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/compersion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 14:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/compersion/</guid><description>Vicarious joy, experiencing pleasure because of another person’s pleasure. Basically the opposite of jealousy.
Coined by the Kerista Community in the 1970s, probably following the model of dispersion, so that use specifically applies to polyamorous relationships, the pleasure of your partner experiencing pleasure with someone else.</description></item><item><title>Common enemy intimacy</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/common-enemy-intimacy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 14:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/common-enemy-intimacy/</guid><description>Via [[books/atlas of the heart|Atlas of the Heart]]:
What’s really fascinating is that hate is actually fueled by our need for connection. I call this common enemy intimacy. I may not know anything about you, but we hate the same people and that creates a counterfeit bond and a sense of belonging.</description></item><item><title>The Buddhist concept of near enemies</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/buddhist-concept-of-near-enemies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 14:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/buddhist-concept-of-near-enemies/</guid><description>via [[books/atlas of the heart|Atlas of the Heart]]:
The Buddhist concept of near enemies: “Near enemies are states that appear similar to the desired quality but actually undermine it. Far enemies are the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. For example, a near enemy of loving-kindness is sentimentality—similar but different.</description></item><item><title>Despair is a state of repair</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/despair-is-a-state-of-repair/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 15:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/despair-is-a-state-of-repair/</guid><description>[[authors/brené brown|Brené Brown]] puts despair as a synonym with hopelessness in [[books/atlas of the heart|Atlas of the Heart]], so I’m going to go with [[authors/david whyte|David Whyte’s]] take on it instead. (Whyte and Brown, lol.)
((Note: maybe what I classify as despair would be more what Brown describes as anguish?</description></item></channel></rss>
