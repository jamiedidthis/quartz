All fiction is fanfiction. All art is fan art.
Long before we had the (very super recent modern) idea that a book = a discrete, permanent object, we had collective folk texts that spread precisely because people remixed and remade them.</description></item><item><title>All transmission is recreation</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/all-transmission-is-recreation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/all-transmission-is-recreation/</guid><description>Heyo, just like copyright, the notion of faithful reproduction is a very modern notion. And I’m gonna add Western industrialized notion—surely many if not all indigenous cultures still see the transmission of stories as re-creation.
A storyteller is a spinner of yarns, and the internet’s founding metaphor is of a web.</description></item><item><title>Both memes and needlework are collective folk texts</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/both-memes-and-needlework-are-collective-folk-texts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/both-memes-and-needlework-are-collective-folk-texts/</guid><description>“Teks,” the root of “technology,” meant a treatise on an art, craft, or grammar, before the meaning transferred to mechanical arts and then to digital tech.

We are constantly editing, tweaking, cutting, rewriting our vast, chaotic narrative.
