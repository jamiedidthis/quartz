My hope springs eternal, with each new edition, that Sade gets placed in his rightful political context, his radical philosophy that’s more dangerous than any pornography.</description></item><item><title>Juliette</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/juliette/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/juliette/</guid><description>I rarely do this, but there’s another review that says it so well, I’m going to quote it instead of trying to sum up my own thoughts:

I had my suspicions about Sade, that more was going on than just some shock and awe erotica, and in [[books/too like the lightning|Too Like The Lightning]], when he becomes part of the dialogue in a key way, she makes it clear that to read Sade as sadism is too narrow a view.</description></item></channel></rss>
