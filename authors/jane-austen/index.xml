And don’t worry, I’m not about to be the killjoy that strips the romance from it this time. This novel is romantic, a true meeting of minds with the happiest ending Jane Austen has on offer.</description></item><item><title>Sense and Sensibility</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sense-and-sensibility/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sense-and-sensibility/</guid><description>The Austen re-read commences, while [[authors/helena kelly|Helena Kelly’s]] book is fresh in my mind. And hoo boy does it benefit from close reading.
I’m already predisposed to read Jane Austen politically, and I’m already inclined to claim Sense and Sensibility is Austen venting her spleen at the English inheritance law instead of a swoony romance.</description></item><item><title>Emma</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/emma/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/emma/</guid><description>Emma in context Since this was a re-read after [[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]], I’m going to put my relevant highlights from that book here.</description></item><item><title>Mansfield Park</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mansfield-park/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mansfield-park/</guid><description>Mansfield Park in context Since this was a re-read after [[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]], I’m going to put my relevant highlights from that book here.</description></item><item><title>Northanger Abbey</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/northanger-abbey/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/northanger-abbey/</guid><description>Northanger Abbey in context Since this was a re-read after [[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]], I’m going to put my relevant highlights from that book here.</description></item><item><title>Persuasion</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/persuasion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/persuasion/</guid><description>Persuasion in context Since this was a re-read after [[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]], I’m going to put my relevant highlights from that book here.
The references to Burney in Northanger Abbey date to the late 1790s or very early nineteenth century, certainly no later than 1802 or 1803, because in 1802 Burney traveled to France to assist her French husband in some family business, taking advantage of the short-lived cessation of hostilities between France and Britain.</description></item><item><title>The Complete Novels</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-complete-novels/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 15:13:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-complete-novels/</guid><description>My aunt Brenda gave me this edition in 2007, and it’s the copy I use for all my annotations, so I can flip back and forth between books easily. The introduction by Karen Joy Fowler notes how Austen left the politics out of her work, showing just how easy it is to miss [[books/jane austen the secret radical|how thoroughly her work is steeped in politics]], even as Fowler also notes that Hollywood crops out the most interesting bits, the parts that undercut the cozy reading, and lumps herself in “we purists”:</description></item><item><title>Lesley Castle</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/lesley-castle/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/lesley-castle/</guid><description>I like the goodreads review that says “So you think you are a writer. Read this slim volume and weep.” Austen did this at sixteen, and it’s unpardonably good for any writer, much less someone that young. The one fault of the slim volume is that it is indeed slim.</description></item><item><title>Sanditon and Other Stories</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sanditon-and-other-stories/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sanditon-and-other-stories/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
