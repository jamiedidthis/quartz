Favorite always.
The David Mitchell foreword
Picture if you will reading this book when it was published, 1969, the year of Stonewall</description></item><item><title>The Dispossessed</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dispossessed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dispossessed/</guid><description>Sublime. Carefully constructed, nuanced, warmly empathetic, passionately human, complex. If you want a rose-colored ideologue that purports to fix problems with simplistic utopias, look elsewhere.</description></item><item><title>Always Coming Home</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/always-coming-home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/always-coming-home/</guid><description>I’ve been saving this one because [[notes/the carrier bag theory of fiction|the Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction]] has been such a foundational text for me, and this is where Ursula, more than ever, puts that theory to practice.</description></item><item><title>Kalpa Imperial</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/kalpa-imperial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/kalpa-imperial/</guid><description>Exquisite. I could gush about it, or quote it; instead, I’ll say that Angélica translated by Ursula is about the best match you could ask for.</description></item><item><title>Tao Te Ching</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tao-te-ching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tao-te-ching/</guid><description>In my opinion, the definitive text. The Ursula K. Le Guin translation (and footnotes!) is everything. Nobody listens to language the way Ursula does.</description></item><item><title>The Found and the Lost</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-found-and-the-lost/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-found-and-the-lost/</guid><description>Le Guin is the master of the novella. Each of these stories contains a universe; even the stories meant to expand the worlds she’s created in her [[series/hainish cycle|Hainish]] and [[series/earthsea cycle|Earthsea]] cycles, they feel complete unto themselves.</description></item><item><title>The Lathe Of Heaven</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-lathe-of-heaven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-lathe-of-heaven/</guid><description>I can’t remember the last time I read a book with a truly passive protagonist, where his qualities are not his weakness, but his strength.</description></item><item><title>The Unreal and the Real</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-unreal-and-the-real/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-unreal-and-the-real/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Word for World is Forest</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-word-for-world-is-forest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-word-for-world-is-forest/</guid><description>This is how I like a thinly-veiled parable to work, especially an anti-colonialism one.
