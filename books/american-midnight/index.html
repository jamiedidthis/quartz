Untrammeled sexual love was ‚Äúthe strongest and deepest element in all life, the harbinger of hope, of joy, of ecstasy; love, the defier of all laws, of all conventions; the freest, the most powerful molder of human destiny; how can such an all-compelling force be synonymous with that poor little State- and Church-begotten weed, marriage?‚Äù 76</p><p>In 1916, she had spent two more weeks behind bars for defying the country‚Äôs Victorian-era laws against distributing information on birth control-deliberately choosing jail rather than pay a fine. Having worked as a midwife in the slums of the Lower East Side, she knew firsthand what a lifesaver effective birth control could be. Women, she said, should be free to open their minds and close their wombs. 76</p><p>Despite all the other currents of violence in American life, nothing quite equaled the sadistic fury that met any hint of Black assertion. 107</p><p>A sensationalist local newspaper, which supported the Democrats, magnified the friction by printing lurid stories of Black crime. Many were untrue, for the county jail‚Äôs population had actually dropped in 1916. ::Truth, however, has often counted for little when it comes to race in America, and white resentment continued to smolder.:: 110</p><p>In this city, as in others across the country, workers continued to feel the sharp pinch of wartime inflation. White labor unions had been pressing hard for higher wages and had thought they now had a chance of success because the war had dried up the stream of new in-migrants from overseas willing to work for low pay. But suddenly here were Blacks glad to do so, for whom the meager existing wages might be double what they had earned as southern farmworkers. In the eyes of white workers, fearful of losing ground, this threatened to depress their own wages or lose them their jobs entirely. These Black competitors became just what immigrants had been: someone to hate, and their skin color made them dangerously conspicuous. 110</p><p>Confiscated from IWW workers by APL (American Protection League): Victor Hugo‚Äôs novel Les Mis√©rables, and one each of Shakespeare‚Äôs Julius Caesar and Frederic W. Farrar‚Äôs The Life of Christ 123</p><p>In the words of the historian David Brion Davis, ‚ÄúThe years from 1917 to 1921 are probably unmatched in American history for popular hysteria, xenophobia, and paranoid suspicion.‚Äù 132</p><p>Conscientious objectors (Hutterites) in Alcatraz and Leavenworth 147</p><p>With so many war opponents indicted or already behind bars and no real German spies to be found, ::the American Protective League needed targets.:: Draft-dodging ‚Äúslackers‚Äù provided one. Nothing aroused the rage of middle-aged APL members more than young men who might be failing to fight. In addition, the government offered a $50 bonus to anybody who caught such a man. Worth more than $1,000 today, such a reward was tempting because you could seize a suspected ‚Äúslacker‚Äù without a warrant. APL members leapt at the chance. 151</p><p>most beer brewers were of German descent, rage against Germans ::fueled the decades-long drive for Prohibition:: that was now approaching victory: Germans were accused of trying to kill Americans with drink as well as bullets.</p><p>::Now a local vigilante group, the Citizens Patriotic League, packed a school board session with an angry crowd and forced all teaching of German to stop. Nearby communities followed suit, and German books began disappearing from public library shelves.:: 154</p><p>The killing drew little outrage. ‚ÄúIn spite of such excesses as lynchings,‚Äù commented the Washington Post a week later, ‚Äúit is a healthful and wholesome awakening in the interior part of the country.‚Äù 157</p><p>George Creel: ‚Äúif ads could sell face cream and soap, why not a war?‚Äù 175</p><p>Theodore Roosevelt, alert to any movement that threatened his own martial vision of America, once called the party‚Äôs growth ‚Äúfar more ominous than any populist or similar movement in times past.‚Äù The Socialists seemed ‚Äúominous‚Äù to him because they commanded considerable support and could not be condemned as violent revolutionaries, for they competed at the polls. 182</p><p>In half a dozen cities in 1917, including Chicago, worried Republicans and Democrats had agreed to support a single ‚Äúfusion‚Äù candidate for various posts to keep the Socialists from winning a plurality. Socialists increased their representation from two to ten seats in the New York State Assembly. Jubilant party members knew that if they did equally well in the 1918 midterm national elections, their vote total could for the first time be in the millions.<br>For Wilson, however, whose Democrats controlled the House of Representatives by only the narrowest of margins, it would be unthinkable to allow an antiwar party to gain the balance of power in the next Congress. The president was determined to crush the Socialists. 183</p><p>::The pandemic::</p><p>::What made the pandemic even more eerie was the lack of honest news.:: While the war raged, none of the nations fighting it wanted to reveal to their enemies the disease‚Äôs immense toll. One of the few major countries not to muzzle its press was neutral Spain. Especially when its king fell ill, the nation‚Äôs journalists published abundant reports on the mysterious scourge; such material could be safely reprinted elsewhere. Hence the pandemic was informally misnamed ‚Äúthe Spanish Flu.‚Äù<br>American newspapers had already learned the wartime habit of keeping stories upbeat. ‚ÄúAs terrifying as the disease was,‚Äù writes the historian John Barry, ‚Äúthe press made it more so. They terrified by making little of it, for what officials and the press said bore no relationship to what people saw and touched and smelled and endured.‚Äù The chief of health and sanitation for the American wartime shipbuilding program, for example, blithely declared that the virus was ‚Äúnothing more or less than old-fashioned grippe.‚Äù 193</p><p>Continuing fighting after armistice, esp black regiments</p><p>The economist John Maynard Keynes was in the British delegation.<br>‚ÄúIt was commonly believed at the commencement of the Paris Conference,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúthat the President had thought out, with the aid of a large body of advisers, a comprehensive scheme not only for the League of Nations but for the embodiment of the Fourteen Points in an actual Treaty of Peace. But in fact the President had thought out nothing‚Ä¶ He had no plan, no scheme, no constructive ideas whatever for clothing with the flesh of life the commandments which he had thundered from the White House. He could have preached a sermon on any of them or have addressed a stately prayer to the Almighty for their fulfillment; but he could not frame their concrete application to the actual state of Europe.‚Äù 206</p><p>The Seattle mayor opposing strikes: ‚Äúeverything about his law-and-order stance emphasized masculinity.‚Äù And ‚ÄúAmericanism stands for one wife and one country.‚Äù 222</p><p>::‚ÄúThe Red Scare praise of male heroes underscored the notion that the nation needed patriarchal power to withstand domestic subversion.‚Äù:: 224</p><p>::Called for a ban on the teaching of any modern foreign language in American elementary schools:: 230</p><p>Good detective work is difficult, but finding scapegoats is always easy 240</p><p>Nearly 40% of Americans today have at least one ancestor that entered through Ellis island 247</p><p>Lynching an 8 mo pregnant woman upside down, doused her with gasoline and set her on fire, cut her belly open and stomped her baby to death. No one was ever persecuted 251</p><p>The ‚Äúrace riots of 1919‚Äù almost all began as white riots 252</p><p>Threw rocks at a black child at the beach, killing him; police wouldn‚Äôt arrest the white men, but a black man instead 253</p><p>the ‚ÄúRed Summer‚Äù of 1919, from Connecticut to South Carolina, and from Texas to Washington, DC, where 2,000 soldiers were called out. Vigilantes burned more than a dozen Black churches in Georgia alone. 254</p><p>The outline of what happened in Omaha was gruesomely similar to hundreds of other lynchings in this era. But the story has another layer. Like other American cities, Omaha was not without racism to begin with, but, as so often happens, an ambitious politician deliberately inflamed it. The story of what he did, however, would not fully emerge for years. 257</p><p>Political boss wanted to oust the current ‚Äúreform-minded‚Äù mayor, published sensational headlines about black assault and rape, knew black men would be arrested and killed without trial‚Äîhis men in blackface committing the crimes 257</p><p>the county continued to boil, with strikes in critical industries, the worst racial violence in half a century, and ongoing combat in the war between the Right and Left. Domestic warfare 283</p><p>Mob behavior ruled, political theater; Wilson as incapacitated as dad 287</p><p>the Supreme Court had upheld‚Äîunanimously‚Äîthe Espionage and Sedition Acts, the legal foundations for the national crackdown on dissent. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, so eager were politicians to show their toughness that they would introduce some 70 different additional sedition bills in Congress in late 1919 and early 1920.<br>In November 1919, however, something happened that didn‚Äôt immediately change any of this, but offered a flicker of hope. ::A man was large enough to change his mind.:: It was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the justice who had written that unanimous Supreme Court decision upholding the two acts. He didn‚Äôt <em>say</em> he had changed his mind, but he showed it. 289</p><p>Fighting a war to make the world safe for democracy, while eviscerating any dissent at home 300</p><p>Palmer, the ‚Äúman‚Äôs man,‚Äù evoking every possible fear voters might have, from violent upheaval to uppity females 303 (working in tandem with Hoover)</p><p>Hoover‚Äôs goons classifying works by Thomas Paine as ‚Äúanarchistic‚Äù 309</p><p>Louis Post, temporarily in charge of labor dept, stopped the mass deportations, stood up to Hoover, deep integrity 307‚Äì312</p><p>Palmer, staking his presidential bid on maintaining the red scare at full throttle 313</p><p>The stark failure of Palmer‚Äôs May Day predictions put a humiliating dent in his presidential hopes, and also knocked the breath out of the campaign for a new sedition bill; none of the many proposed in Congress passed. The nation‚Äôs daily newspapers, almost all of which had uncritically headlined Palmer‚Äôs warnings without making any attempt to verify them, felt taken for a ride. Some broke ranks with the Red Scare for the first time. 322</p><p>::The illusion of a sinister radical menace guarantees big budgets.:: 323</p><p>Why was Palmer, instead of concentrating on such issues‚Äîwhich actually might have served him well politically‚Äîso obsessed by the certainty of a Communist uprising? He was, one writer comments, ‚Äúa demagogue who believed his own demagoguery.‚Äù In the end, he proved as blind as many would-be revolutionaries to the fact that most Americans have seldom dreamed of an armed left-wing revolution. 323</p><p>Louis Post eviscerating them with intelligence, charm, and humor 324</p><p>Post treated the committee as if they were students, and to teach them he used the full range of rhetorical skills he had developed as a traveling single-tax lecturer. During ten hours of testimony spread over two days, he gave the committee a graduate-level class in immigration law and the way the Justice Department had completely ignored constitutional protections for those it arrested.<br>He leavened all this with a needle-sharp wit, which none of the con-gressmen, almost all of them lawyers accustomed to making witnesses squirm, seemed to expect. When Post referred to something as being common knowledge, the committee‚Äôs chair expressed skepticism, say-ing, ‚ÄúI am not impressed with the truth of everything I hear.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúNeither am I, Post shot back. ‚ÄúIf I had been I would have deported every man that the detectives arrested.‚Äù 324</p><p>‚ÄúSome day, when the history of American liberty comes to be written,‚Äù declared the liberal <em>Nation</em>, ‚Äúthe name of Louis F. Post will be given a high place, because he dared in a trying time to defy the forces of madness and hatred and greed that now threaten to overwhelm us.‚Äù 325</p><p>‚ÄúIn these times of hysteria, I wonder that no witches have been hung.‚Äù (Judge Anderson) 326</p><p>::Wood‚Äôs supporters were filled with ‚Äúhatreds and violence‚Ä¶turned against all manner of imaginary enemies‚Äù:: 33</p><p>Claiming Ellis Island was a sinister indoctrination center 335</p><p>Albert Johnson‚Äôs decades long crusade against immigrants climaxes in the 1924 passage of the Johnson-Reed act, which placed the most severe restrictions on immigration in American history. It reduced by nearly 95% the number of unwanted immigrants, mostly Italians, Poles, and Jews. ::A young agitator in prison in Germany was so impressed by this law that he praised it in Mein Kampf, and sought to replicate it.:: The same law would bar untold numbers of refugees from the Holocaust, leaving them to end their lives in Hitler‚Äôs death camps. 351</p><p>When a proposal was under discussion in 1939 that would have made an exception to the Johnson-Reed Act to allow 20,000 Jewish refugee children to enter the country, one of those who led the successful fight against it was Trevor, who declared that he wanted ‚Äúto protect the youth of America from this foreign invasion.‚Äù A product of the darkest period of America‚Äôs twentieth century was precisely what stopped us from sheltering those trying to flee the nadir of the century in Europe. 352</p><p>Socialism, of course, had never taken as deep root in the United States as it had in Europe, but for some years it was a significant force in American politics. The Republican and Democratic legislators who voted for early-twentieth-century reform measures like child labor laws and the income tax did so in part to stave off demands from the Socialist Party for bigger changes.<br>In 1911, for example, the Socialist congressman Victor Berger of Wisconsin introduced a bill for a national old-age pension, a goal that would be realized 24 years later as Social Security. In 1916, Socialist Meyer London of New York introduced a bill strikingly similar to one that would become law nearly a century later, the Affordable Care Act.<br>He also advocated freedom for the Philippines, unemployment insurance, and paid maternity leave. 353</p><p>The Socialist Party would never recover from the mass jailings and the crushing of its press that took place under Wilson. Had it not been so hobbled, even with a minority of voters, it might well have pushed the mainstream parties into creating the sort of stronger social safety net and national health insurance systems that people take for granted in Canada and Western Europe today. This is one of American history‚Äôs most tantalizing ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù questions. 354</p><p>Stark impunity bred more violence -> the Tulsa massacre, kkk resurgence</p><p>On Memorial Day 1927, a march of some 1,000 Klansmen through the New York City borough of Queens turned into a brawl with the police.
