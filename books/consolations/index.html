The body is inhabited in a different way when we are alone than when we are with others. Alone, we live in our bodies as a question rather than a statement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A lifeâ€™s work is not a series of stepping-stones, onto which we calmly place our feet, but more like an ocean crossing where there is no path, only a heading, a direction, in conversation with the elements.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anger is the deepest form of compassion, for another, for the world, for the self, for a life, for the body, for a family and for all our ideals, all vulnerable and all, possibly about to be hurt. Stripped of physical imprisonment and violent reaction, anger is the purest form of care, the internal living flame of anger always illuminates what we belong to, what we wish to protect and what we are willing to hazard ourselves for.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But anger truly felt at its center is the essential living flame of being fully alive and fully here; it is a quality to be followed to its source, to be prized, to be tended, and an invitation to finding a way to bring that source fully into the world through making the mind clearer and more generous, the heart more compassionate and the body larger and strong enough to hold it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Beauty is the harvest of presence.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Taking a new step always leads to a kind of radical internal simplification, where, suddenly, very large parts of us, parts of us we have kept gainfully employed for years, parts of us still rehearsing the old complicated story, are suddenly out of a job.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It is always hard to believe that the courageous step is so close to us, that it is closer than we ever could imagine, that in fact, we already know what it is, and that the step is simpler, more radical than we had thought: which is why we so often prefer the story to be more elaborate, our identities clouded by fear, the horizon safely in the distance, the essay longer than it needs to be and the answer safely in the realm of impossibility.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To confess is to declare oneself ready for a more courageous road, one in which a previously defended identity might not only be shorn away, but be seen to be irrelevant, a distraction, a working delusion that kept us busy over the years and held us unaccountable to the real question.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Our fears about the result of confessing are well grounded; the old identity the secret was protecting almost never survives the revelation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Courage is the measure of our heartfelt participation with life, with another, with a community, a work; a future. To be courageous is not necessarily to go anywhere or do anything except to make conscious those things we already feel deeply and then to live through the unending vulnerabilities of those consequences.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Crisis is a rehearsal in fact for the act of dying, a place where inside and outside can reverse and flow with no fixed form.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Denial is underestimated as a state of being.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Faced with the depth of loss and disappearance in the average life, a measure of denial is creative, necessary and self-compassionate: children are not meant to know they are one day to die and older adults are not meant to tell them. Refusing to face what we are not yet ripe and ready to face can help us to live in the present.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Denial is a beautiful transitional state every human being inhabits before they are emancipated into the next larger context and orphaned, often against their will, from an old and very familiar home.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To live in denial is to be in very good company. <mark>Denial is the crossroads between perception and readiness, to deny denial is to invite powers into our lives we have not yet readied ourselves to meet.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Despair takes us in when we have nowhere else to go; when we feel the heart cannot break anymore, when our world or our loved ones disappear, when we feel we cannot be loved or do not deserve to be loved, when our God disappoints, or when our body is carrying profound pain in a way that does not seem to go away.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Despair is a last protection. To disappear through despair, is to seek a temporary but necessary illusion, a place where we hope nothing can ever find us in the same way again.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Despair is a necessary and seasonal state of repair, a temporary healing absence, an internal physiological and psychological winter when our previous forms of participation in the world take a rest; it is a loss of horizon, it is the place we go when we do not want to be found in the same way anymore.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Despair turns to depression and abstraction when we try to make it stay beyond its appointed season and start to shape our identity around its frozen disappointments.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But despair can only stay beyond its appointed time through the forced artificiality of created distance, by abstracting ourselves from bodily feeling, by trapping ourselves in the disappointed mind, by convincing ourselves that the seasons have stopped and can never turn again, and perhaps, most simply and importantly, by refusing to let the body breathe by itself, fully and deeply. Despair is kept alive by freezing our sense of time and the rhythms of time; when we no longer feel imprisoned by time, and when the season is allowed to turn, despair cannot survive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>The antidote to despair is not to be found in the brave attempt to cheer ourselves up with happy abstracts, but in paying a profound and courageous attention to the body and the breath, independent of our imprisoning thoughts and stories, even strangely, in paying attention to despair itself, and the way we hold it, and which we realize, was never ours to own and to hold in the first place. To see and experience despair fully in our body is to begin to see it as a necessary, seasonal visitation, and the first step in letting it have its own life, neither holding it nor moving it on before its time.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We let our bodies and we let our world breathe again. In that place, strangely, despair cannot do anything but change into something else, into some other season, as it was meant to do, from the beginning.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Despair is a difficult, beautiful necessary, a binding understanding between human beings caught in a fierce and difficult world where half of our experience is mediated by loss, but it is a season, <a href=/notes/we-are-wiggles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/we-are-wiggles>a waveform passing through the body</a>, not a prison surrounding us. <mark>A season left to itself will always move, however slowly, under its own patience, power and volition.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Two people, simply by looking at the future in radically different ways have completely different futures awaiting them no matter their immediate course of action.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>We are shaped by our shaping of the world and are shaped again in turn. The way we face the world alters the face we see in the world.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Disappointment is inescapable but necessary; a misunderstood mercy and when approached properly, an agency for transformation and the hidden, underground, engine of trust and generosity in a human life. The attempt to create a life devoid of disappointment is the attempt to avoid the vulnerabilities that make the conversations of life real, moving, and life-like; it is the attempt to avoid our own necessary and merciful heartbreak.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What we call disappointment may be just the first stage of our emancipation into the next greater pattern of existence.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Disappointment is just the initial meeting with the frontier of an evolving life, an invitation to reality, which we expected to be one particular way and turns out to be another, often something more difficult, more overwhelming and strangely, in the end, more rewarding.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It may be that the part of us that was struck and hurt can never forgive, and that strangely, forgiveness never arises from the part of us that was actually wounded.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To forgive is to put oneself in a larger gravitational field of experience than the one that first seemed to hurt us. We reimagine ourselves in the light of our maturity and we reimagine the past in the light of our new identity, we allow ourselves to be gifted by a story larger than the story that first hurt us and left us bereft.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>At the end of life, the wish to be forgiven is ultimately the chief desire of almost every human being. In refusing to wait; in extending forgiveness to others now, we begin the long journey of becoming the person who will be large enough, able enough and generous enough to receive, at the very end, that absolution ourselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Friendship not only helps us see ourselves through anotherâ€™s eyes, but can be sustained over the years only with someone who has repeatedly forgiven us for our trespasses as we must find it in ourselves to forgive them in turn.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Without tolerance and mercy all friendships die.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self, <mark>the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been <em>seen</em> by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Genius is something we already possess.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Each one of us has a unique signature, inherited from our ancestors, our landscape, our language, and beneath it a half-hidden geology of existence: memories, hurts, triumphs, and stories in our lineage that have not yet been fully told.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To live out our genius is to live out the conversation between our particular inherited body and the body of the world from which we seem to have been made.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To stop giving in any situation is to call an end to relationship.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The art often involves giving the wrong thing to the wrong person at the wrong time and learning how to do the opposite through time and trial, it means getting beyond the boundaries of our own needs, it means understanding another and anotherâ€™s life, it acknowledges implicitly that we ourselves must be recipients of things we cannot often identify or even find ourselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Little wonder then that the holiday giving that is none of these, that is automatic, chore-based, walking round the mall-based, exhausts us, debilitates us, and in the end is quite often subtly insulting to the one whom we eventually give the random item.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Gratitude is the understanding that many millions of things come together and live together and mesh together and breathe together in order for us to take even one more breath of air, that the underlying gift of life and incarnation as a living, participating human being is a privilege; that we are miraculously, part of something, rather than nothing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Thanksgiving happens when our sense of presence meets all other presences. Being unappreciative might mean we are simply not paying attention.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ground is what lies beneath our feet. It is the place where we already stand; a state of recognition, the place or the circumstances to which we belong whether we wish to or not. It is what holds and supports us, but also what we do not want to be true; it is what challenges us, physically or psychologically, irrespective of our hoped for needs. It is the living, underlying foundation that tells us what we are, where we are, what season we are in and what, no matter what we wish in the abstract, is about to happen in our body, in the world or in the conversation between the two.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The exorcism of an unwanted spirit is consistent the world over: an invitation to return home; for it and for us to find our way back, to cease our restless ways and to quit disturbing othersâ€™ lives or walking their houses by night.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We become real by forgiving ourselves and we forgive ourselves by changing the foundational pattern, and especially by changing our present behavior to those we have hurt.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A fear of ghosts, or a fear of our own haunted mind is the measure of our absence in this world. We cease to be afraid when we give away what was never ours in the first place and begin to be present to our own lives just as we find them, even in facing what we have banished from our thoughts and made homeless, even when we do not know the way forward ourselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Heartbreak is unpreventable; the natural outcome of caring for people and things over which we have no control, of holding in our affections those who inevitably move beyond our line of sight.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>Heartbreak is how we mature; yet we use the word <em>heartbreak</em> as if it only occurs when things have gone wrongâ€¦</mark> But heartbreak may be the very essence of being human, of being on the journey from here to there, and of coming to care deeply for what we find along the way.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It may be that there may be not only no real <em>life</em> without the raw revelation of heartbreak, but no single path we can take <em>within</em> a life that will allow us to escape without having that imaginative organ we call the heart broken by what it holds and then has to let go.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Heartbreak asks us not to look for an alternative path, because there is no alternative path. It is an introduction to what we love and have loved, an inescapable and often beautiful question, something and someone that has been with us all along, asking us to be ready for the ultimate letting go.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are born with an absolute necessity for help.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even the most solitary writer needs a reader, the most Machiavellian mobster a trusted lieutenant, the most independent candidate, a voter.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Hiding is a way of staying alive. Hiding is a way of holding ourselves until we are ready to come into the light.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Hiding is underestimated. We are hidden by life in our motherâ€™s womb until we grow and ready ourselves for our first appearance in the lighted world; to appear too early in that world is to find ourselves with the immediate necessity for outside intensive care.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>We live in a time of the dissected soul, the immediate disclosure; our thoughts, imaginings and longings exposed to the light too much, too early and too often, our best qualities squeezed too soon into a world already awash with ideas that oppress our sense of self and our sense of others.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What is real is almost always to begin with, hidden, and does not want to be understood by the part of our mind that mistakenly thinks it knows what is happening. What is precious inside us does not care to be known by the mind in ways that diminish its presence.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Hiding is an act of freedom from the misunderstanding of others, especially in the enclosing world of oppressive secret government and private entities, attempting to name us, to anticipate us, to leave us with no place to hide and grow in ways unmanaged by a creeping necessity for absolute naming, absolute tracking and absolute control.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>Hiding is a bid for independence, from others, from mistaken ideas we have about ourselves, from an oppressive and mistaken wish to keep us completely safe, completely ministered to, and therefore completely managed. Hiding is creative, necessary and beautifully subversive of outside interference and control. Hiding leaves life to itself, to become more of itself. Hiding is the radical independence necessary for our emergence into the light of a proper human future.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Every human being dwells intimately close to a door of revelation they are afraid to pass through. Honesty lies in understanding our close and necessary relationship with not wanting to hear the truth.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Honesty is not found in revealing the truth, but in understanding how deeply afraid of it we are.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Honesty allows us to live with not knowing. We do not know the full story, we do not know where we are in the story; we do not know who is at fault or who will carry the blame in the end.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Joy can be made by practiced, hard-won achievement as much as by an unlooked for, passing act of grace arrived out of nowhere.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To feel a full and untrammeled joy is to have become fully generous; to allow ourselves to be joyful is to have walked through the doorway of fear, the dropping away of the anxious worried self felt like a thankful death itself, a disappearance, a giving away, overheard in the laughter of friendship, the vulnerability of happiness felt suddenly as a strength, a solace and a source, <mark>the claiming of our place in the living conversation, the sheer privilege of being in the presence of a mountain, a sky or a well-loved familiar face â€” I was here and you were here and together we made a world.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Loneliness is the doorway to unspecified desire.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In the grand scale of things, loneliness is a privilege. Human beings may have the ability to feel aloneness as no other creature can; with a power magnified by intelligence and imagination. Animals may feel alone in an instinctual way, moving naturally and affectionately toward others of their kind, but human beings may be the only beings that can articulate, imagine or call for a specific life they feel they might be missing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Loneliness is not a concept, it is the body constellating, attempting to become proximate and even join with other bodies, through physical touch, through conversation or the mediation of the intellect and the imagination.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In longing we move and are moving from a known but abstracted elsewhere, to a beautiful, about to be reached, someone, something or somewhere we want to call our own.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Maturity is the ability to live fully and equally in multiple contexts; most especially, the ability, despite our grief and losses, to courageously inhabit the past the present and the future all at once.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Immaturity is shown by making false choices: living only in the past, or only in the present, or only in the future, or even, living only two out of the three.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But maturity beckons also, asking us to be larger, more fluid, more elemental, less cornered, less unilateral, a living conversational intuition between the inherited story, the one we are privileged to inhabit and the one, if we are large enough and broad enough, moveable enough and even, <em>here</em> enough, just, astonishingly, about to occur.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>But the guruâ€™s urge to live only in the now misunderstands the multilayered inheritance of existence, where all epochs live and breathe in parallels.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We actually inhabit memory as a living threshold, as a place of choice and volition and imagination, a crossroads where our future diverges according to how we interpret, or perhaps more accurately, how we live the story we have inherited.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We might recall the ancient Greek world where <em>Memory</em> was always understood to be the mother of the muses, meaning that all of her nine imaginative daughters, all of the nine forms of human creative endeavor recognized by the ancient Greek imagination, and longed for by individuals and societies to this day, were born from the womb and the body of memory.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Most of our heartbreak comes from attempting to name who or what we love and the way we love, too early in the vulnerable journey of discovery.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When we demand a certain specific kind of reciprocation before the revelation has flowered completely we find ourselves disappointed and bereaved and in that grief may miss the particular form of love that is actually possible but that did not meet our initial and too specific expectations.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We name mostly in order to control but what is worth loving does not want to be held within the bounds of too narrow a calling.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>Nostalgia is not an immersion in the past, nostalgia is the first annunciation that the past as we know it is coming to an end.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pain is the doorway to the here and now.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Physical or emotional pain is an ultimate form of ground, saying, to each of us, in effect, there is no other place than this place, no other body than this body, no other limb or joint or pang or sharpness or heartbreak but this searing presence. Pain asks us to heal by focusing not only on the place the pain is felt but also the actual way the pain is felt. Pain is a form of alertness and particularity; pain is a way in.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pain teaches us a fine economy, in movement, in the heartâ€™s affections, in what we ask of ourselves and eventually in what we ask in others.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In real pain we have no other choice but to learn to ask for help and on a daily basis. Pain tells us we belong and cannot live forever alone or in isolation. Pain makes us understand reciprocation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pain is the first proper step to real compassion; it can be a foundation for understanding all those who struggle with their existence.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Experiencing real pain ourselves, our moral superiority comes to an end; we stop urging others to get with the program, to get their act together or to sharpen up, and start to look for the particular form of debilitation, visible or invisible that every person struggles to overcome. <mark>In pain, we suddenly find our understanding and compassion engaged as to why others may find it hard to fully participate.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pain makes drama of an everyday life with our body and our presence firmly caught on stage and in the spotlight, we are visible to others in a way over which we have no choice, limping here or leaning there.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Others do not know the gift in simply being healthy, of being unconsciously free to move or walk or run. Pain is a lonely road, no one can know the measure of our particular agonies, but through pain we have the possibility, just the possibility, of coming to know others as we have, with so much difficulty, come to know ourselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If it is difficult for anything in the real world <a href=/notes/we-are-wiggles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/we-are-wiggles>to move in a true straight line</a>, think of the impossibility of two things moving together in two parallel straight lines.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The great measure of human maturation is the increasing understanding that we move through life in the blink of an eye; that we are not long with the privilege of having eyes to see, ears to hear, a voice with which to speak and arms to put round a loved one; that we are simply passing through.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>The courageous life is the life that is equal to this unceasing tidal and seasonal becoming: and strangely beneath all, stillness being the only proper physical preparation for joining the breathing autonomic exchange of existence.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To see procrastination as undesirable, especially in the initial stages of an endeavor is to say that Job was procrastinating by wrestling with his angel; that a woman feeling her first birth pangs should simply get on with it; that a bud should be broken open to reveal the full glory of the flower. <mark>What looks from the outside like our delay; our lack of commitment; even our laziness may have more to do with a slow, necessary ripening through time and the central struggle with the realities of any endeavor to which we have set our minds.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Any creative frontier is by its nature a conversational frontier, it is a meeting of the inner and the outer worlds we inhabit, it is a knitting together, a growing together a surprising arrival with its own, to begin with, unknown unfolding, caught within it as part of its own genius.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Procrastination when studied closely can be a beautiful thing, a parallel with patience, a companionable friend, a revealer of the true pattern, already caught within us; acknowledging for instance, as a writer, that before a book can be written, most of the ways it cannot be written must be tried first, in our minds; on the blank screen on the empty page or staring at the bedroom ceiling at four in the morning. Procrastination enables us to understand the true measure of our reluctance.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>An endeavor achieved without delay, wrong turnings, occasional blank walls and a vein of self-doubt running through all, leading eventually to some degree of heartbreak is a thing of the moment, a bagatelle, and often neither use nor ornament. It will be scanned for a moment and put aside. What is worthwhile carries the struggle of the maker written within it, but wrought into the shape of an earned understanding.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Procrastination does not stop a project from coming to fruition, what stops us is giving up on an original idea because we have not got to the heart of the reason we are delaying, nor let the true form of our reluctance instruct us in the way ahead.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Regret is a short, evocative and achingly beautiful word; an elegy to lost possibilities even in its brief annunciation, it is also a rarity and almost never heard except where the speaker insists that they have none, that they are brave and forward-looking and could not possibly imagine their life in any other way than the way it is.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To regret fully is to appreciate how high the stakes are in even the average human life.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>Rest is the conversation between what we love to do and how we love to be.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To rest is to give up on worrying and fretting and the sense that there is something wrong with the world unless we are there to put it right; to rest is to fall back literally or figuratively from outer targets and shift the goal not to an inner static bullâ€™s eye, an imagined state of perfect stillness, but to an inner state of natural exchange.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The template of natural exchange is the breath, the autonomic giving and receiving that forms the basis and the measure of life itself.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>We are rested when we let things alone and let ourselves alone, to do what we do best, breathe as the body intended us to breathe.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Robustness and vulnerability belong together.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The less contact we have with anything other than our own body, our own rhythm or the way we have arranged our life, the more afraid we can become of the frontier where actual noise, meetings and changes occur.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Run away is what most human beings would like to do a great deal of the time. It is the <em>flight</em> part of the <em>fight or flight</em> deeply in our bodies and our past, it is our protection, an evolutionary momentum and a biological memory deep in the human body that allowed our ancestors to survive to another day and bequeath to us, generations later, this day. <mark>To want to run away is an essence of being human, it transforms any staying through the transfigurations of choice.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Strangely, we are perhaps most fully incarnated as humans, when part of us does not want to be here, or doesnâ€™t know how to be here.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To understand the part of us that wants nothing to do with the full necessities of work, of relationship, of doing what is necessary, is to learn humility, to cultivate self-compassion and to sharpen that sense of humor essential to a merciful perspective of both a self and another.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In the wild, the best response to dangerous circumstances is often not to run but to assume a profoundly attentive identity, to pay attention to what seems to threaten and in that attention, not to assume the identity of the victim.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Besides, there is rarely one discrete identity who needs to run. We have many different constituencies inside and out. We are not only protectors of a multilayered self but also of our family and community, of children, of those who are infirm or temporarily incapacitated, or who simply have the wrong perspective. We decide not to run not only because there are many who would be left behind who cannot run as fast as we can, but also because in turning to the source of the fear we have the possibility of finding a different way forward, a larger good, through circumstances, rather than away from them in some supposedly safe area where threats no longer occur.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Self-knowledge is not fully possible for human beings. We do not reside in a body, a mind or a world where it is achievable or from the point of being interesting, even desirable. Half of what lies in the heart and mind is potentiality; resides in the darkness of the unspoken and unarticulated and has not yet come into being: this hidden unspoken half of a person will supplant and subvert any present understandings we have about ourselves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Human beings are always, and always will be, a frontier between what is known and what is not known.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>What we are actually about to become or are afraid of becoming always trumps and rules over what we think we are already.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The hope that a human being can achieve complete honesty and self-knowledge with regard to themselves is a fiction and a chimera, the jargon and goals of a corporate educational system brought to bear on the depths of an identity where the writ of organizing language does not run. Self-knowledge includes the understanding that the self we want to know is about to disappear. What we can understand is the way we occupy this frontier between the known and the unknown, the way we hold the conversation of life, the figure we cut at that edge, <mark>but a detailed audit of the self is not possible and diminishes us in the attempt to establish it; we are made on a grander scale, half afraid of ourselves, half in love with immensities beyond any name we can give.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What we recognize and applaud as honesty and transparency in an individual is actually the humble demeanor of the apprentice, someone paying extreme attention, to themselves, to others, to life, to the next step, which they may survive or they may not; <mark>someone who does not have all the answers but who is attempting to learn what they can, about themselves and those with whom they share the journey, someone like everyone else, wondering what they and their society are about to turn into.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To change the shape of ourselves is to change the shape of the shadow we cast. To become transparent is to lose oneâ€™s shadow altogether, something we often desire in the spiritual abstract, but actually something that is not attainable by human beings â€” to change the shape of the identity that casts a shadow is more possible. Shadow is a necessary consequence of being in a sunlit visible world, but it is not a central identity, or a power waiting to overwhelm us.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Mythologically, having no shadow means being of another world, not being fully human, not being in or of this world.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To feel shy is to look five ways at once: to the beckoning new life in front of us, to the line of retreat behind us, to alternative possibilities of escape to left and right, and in really difficult circumstances, the hope for a complete and sudden disappearance.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Shyness is underestimated and neglected as a way of being when first approaching the new, the necessary and the overwhelming.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Our visual media, especially television, tells us that shyness is unnecessary and thus corrupts our sense of what constitutes a real exploration. Likewise, in our virtual travels we rarely meet many beautiful representations of shyness through social media, but physical shyness tells us through our very vulnerability, that we are at last in the presence of the mystery, of some thing, some place, or some one we deeply desire or that represents what we desire, though we do not as yet, in our essential physical helplessness, know how to bring it about.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Total confidence at the beginning of a new phase of life means we are misinformed, that we are deeply mistaken, that we think we know what is about to occur and who we are about to become. Shyness is an invitation to a particular form of beauty, to qualities that are meant to be both practiced and cultivated; shyness is our friend; the annunciation that we are just about to walk through the door and through all our difficulties, attempt another beginning.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Real silence puts any present understanding to shame; orphans us from certainty; leads us beyond the well-known and accepted reality and confronts us with the unknown and previously unacceptable conversation about to break in upon our lives.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>To become deeply silent is not to become still, but to become tidal and seasonal, a coming and going that has its own inimitable, essential character, a story not fully told, like the background of the sea, or the rain falling or the river going on, out of sight, out of our lives.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Solace is what we must look for when the mind cannot bear the pain, the loss or the suffering that eventually touches every life and every endeavor; when longing does not come to fruition in a form we can recognize, when people we know and love disappear, when hope must take a different form than the one we have shaped for it.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Solace is the beautiful, imaginative home we make where disappointment can go to be rehabilitated. When life does not in any way add up, we must turn to the part of us that has never wanted a life of simple calculation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Solace is not an evasion, nor a cure for our suffering, nor a made up state of mind. Solace is a direct seeing and participation; a celebration of the beautiful coming and going, appearance and disappearance of which we have always been a part.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To look for solace is to learn to ask fiercer and more exquisitely pointed questions, questions that reshape our identities and our bodies and our relation to others.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But solace also asks us very direct and forceful questions. Firstly, how will you bear the inevitable that is coming to you? And how will you endure it through the years? And above all, how will you shape a life equal to and as beautiful and as astonishing as a world that can birth you, bring you into the light and then just as you are beginning to understand it, take you away?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are something for the world to run up against and rub up against: through the trials of love, through pain, through happiness, through our simple everyday movement through the world.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In the ancient world the touch of a God was seen as both a blessing and a violation â€” at one and the same time. Being alive in the world means being found by that world and sometimes touched to the core in ways we would rather not experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To forge an untouchable, invulnerable identity is actually a sign of retreat from this world; of weakness, a sign of fear rather than strength and betrays a strange misunderstanding of an abiding, foundational and necessary reality: that untouched, we disappear.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Unconditional love is not fully possible. We are mortal creatures of living and dying and how we love and what we love is conditional upon where we stand in the drama and the seasonality of that living and dying. Love may be sanctified and ennobled by its commitment to the unconditional horizon of perfection, but what makes love real in the human world seems to be our moving, struggling conversation with that wanted horizon rather than any possibility of arrival.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The hope for, or the declaration of a purely spiritual, unconditional love is more often a coded desire for immunity and safety, an attempt to forgo the trials of vulnerability, powerlessness and the exquisite pain to which we apprentice ourselves in a relationship, a marriage, in raising children, in a work we love and desire.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The invitation is made to us every day whether we desire it or no, to enter a deeply human world of robust vulnerability, shot through with a sometimes joyful, more often difficult helplessness, to risk ourselves in the conditional world in which we live and to accept that there is no possible path we can follow where we will be untouched by the heartbreak, the difficulties and the joys that move us and move through us, under the beautiful and beautifully conditional guise of love.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whether our affections are caught in romantic love, trying to see our neighbors as ourselves or trying to love a great but distant God, our love rarely seems to be returned in the mode that it is given.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Human beings live in disappointment and a self-appointed imprisonment when they refuse to love unless they are loved the selfsame way in return.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Vulnerability is not a choice, vulnerability is the underlying, ever present and abiding undercurrent of our natural state.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>More seriously, in refusing our vulnerability we refuse the help needed at every turn of our existence and immobilize the essential, tidal and conversational foundations of our identity.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The only choice we have as we mature is how we inhabit our vulnerability, how we become larger and more courageous and more compassionate through our intimacy with disappearance.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Withdrawal can be the very best way of stepping forward and done well, a beautiful freeing act of mercy and as an art form, underestimated in this time of constant action and engagement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We stick to the wrong thing quite often, not because it will come to fruition by further effort, but because we cannot let go of the way we have decided to tell the story and we become further enmeshed even by trying to make sense of what entraps us, when what is needed is a simple, clean breaking away.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To remove ourselves entirely and absolutely, abruptly and at times un-compromisingly is often the real and radically courageous break for freedom. â€¦We start the process of losing our false enemies, and even our false friends, and most especially the false sense of self we have manufactured to live with them: we make ourselves available for the simple purification of seeing ourselves and our world more elementally and therefore more clearly again.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><mark>We withdraw not to disappear, but to find another ground from which to see; a solid ground from which to step, and from which to speak again, in a different way, a clear, rested, embodied voice, our life as a suddenly emphatic statement and one from which we do not wish to withdraw.</mark></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Work, among all its abstracts, is actually intimacy, the place where the self meets the world.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To reduce work in our societal imagination merely to competition, and to the act of beating the competition, is to condemn our societies, our communities and our individual lives to imaginative poverty of the very worst kind.</p></blockquote><ul class=tags style=margin-top:4em><li>Additional shelves //</li><li><a href=https://notebook.jamieharris.co/shelves/embodiment/>embodiment</a></li><li><a href=https://notebook.jamieharris.co/shelves/mental-health/>mental-health</a></li><li><a href=https://notebook.jamieharris.co/shelves/therapeutic/>therapeutic</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3 class=allcaps>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/notes/despair-is-a-state-of-repair/ data-ctx=Consolations data-src=/notes/despair-is-a-state-of-repair class=internal-link>Despair is a state of repair</a></li><li><a href=/notes/emodiversity-is-a-sign-of-well-being/ data-ctx=Consolations data-src=/notes/emodiversity-is-a-sign-of-well-being class=internal-link>Emodiversity is a sign of well-being</a></li><li><a href=/notes/the-importance-of-anger/ data-ctx=Consolations data-src=/notes/the-importance-of-anger class=internal-link>The importance of anger</a></li><li><a href=/private/digest/books-of-november-24/ data-ctx="Consolations: The Solace, Nourishment and Underlying Meaning of Everyday Words" data-src=/private/digest/books-of-november-24 class=internal-link>Books of November â€™24</a></li></ul></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><div class=links-wrapper><ul><li><a href=https://notebook.jamieharris.co/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/>Notes</a></li><li><a href=https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/>Books</a></li><li><a href=https://notebook.jamieharris.co/info/>Info</a></li></ul><p>Powered by <a href=https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/>Quartz</a>, made with &#9825;
