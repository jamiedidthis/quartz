I thought I had finally found the holy grail, cycling fiction (nay, romance!) that gets the cycling facts correct. The dedication is to Wouter Weylandt(!), there’s a glossary of French terms and race classifications, and four pages in she’s name-dropping Garmin-Sharp and Fausto Coppi. My expectations, below sea level, started to gain elevation.</p><p>Energy gels taste like “chemical fruit with the consistency of semen.” (lol.) Her Italian cyclist knows English, French, German, Spanish, and “enough Flemish to insult Belgian riders—it’s important to insult them so they understand.” (Ha! Accurate to message boards I’ve been on.) Pillow talk is Contador, Pantani, and Big Mig. 10/10, no notes. 👌</p><p>And then. And then.</p><p>I’m honestly baffled as to how an author could research enough to get the above details correct, yet have it go so wrong. By chapter 5, I was side-eyeing a couple things. By chapter 14, my rant-notes were getting extensive. By chapter 21, I had so many WTFs that I wrote myself the note to “walk it off, Jamie, walk it off”… and then I did, taking a few laps around the room to cool down.</p><p>She fundamentally misunderstands the most basic race dynamics, not to mention the types of disciplines involved in cycling, in a way that negates the emotional impact of the story. She wants me to think Luca is struggling to prove himself while tossing off asides about him winning the biggest races in the world like it’s no big deal. She wants me to feel these big feelings about things that could never happen to Luca’s career. She forgoes the very real struggles and dangers of being a pro cyclist in favor of nonsensical melodrama.</p><p>In a weird way, I’m less annoyed when a writer is phoning it in. To put this much effort into a well-researched book while botching the most obvious, basic fundamentals of the sport is orders of magnitude more disappointing. And if it had less real-life touchstones, then I could handwave more of the errors as a reality-adjacent fantasy.</p><p>I’ve established with previous attempts at <a href=/books/the-black-jersey rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/the-black-jersey>cycling fiction</a> and <a href=/books/racing-to-you rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/racing-to-you>romance</a> that what a cycling fan wants is to be entertained and to nitpick. There was so much of the latter it ruined the former, and by the time she had botched the Giro beyond recognition (my beloved Giro!!) and had the antagonist <em>DIE OF A BROKEN COLLARBONE,</em> I could not. I was rooting against the couple out of spite and nothing could redeem it.</p><p>For the brave or the foolish, I’ve copied my raw notes below, with a few addendums. I made it to the end, so allow me to indulge in the pleasure of WTF-ing all over the place with my 20 years of nutso cycling fan bonafides.</p><hr><a href=#raw-notes class=hanchor-text><h2 id=raw-notes>Raw notes<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h2></a><p>“Are those

Flèche is a one-day race, no jerseys awarded. And Chris says this while trying to prove his cycling cred and that he’s not one of <em>those fans</em> who only follow the TDF 🙃</p><p>Whoa, fatal impact—now I see why it’s dedicated to Weylandt. That was well done, harrowing and emotional</p><p>Driedaagse van West Vlaanderen! (aka Three Days of West Flanders, which morphed into
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwars_door_West-Vlaanderen rel=noopener>Dwars door West-Vlaanderen</a>, aka Tour of West Flanders, then ceased to exist after 2018. Not to be confused with
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwars_door_Vlaanderen rel=noopener>Dwars door Vlaanderen</a>, aka Tour of Flanders, a different event altogether and still a key part of Flemish Cycling Week!)</p><p>WTF are these <a href=/notes/pro-cycling-race-numbers rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/pro-cycling-race-numbers>race numbers</a>??? Me, reading this whole chapter thinking that Luca’s on a continental team and thus his career is much worse off than I thought 🤦🏻‍♀️</p><p>All due respect to Driedaagse van West Vlaanderen, but there is NO WAY a stacked startlist with the World Champ, Olympic time trial champ,<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> and GC guys are at this little 2.2 race<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup><br>(It’s so easy to fact check too! Here’s
<a href=https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/3daagse-van-west-vlaanderen/2013/startlist rel=noopener>the startlist for 2013</a>: it’s all classics riders and sprinters—namely Cav—prepping for Tirreno)</p><p>“So what if it was a second tier stage race? That only meant more national and regional teams mixed in with all the top level pros.” Chris is reallllly not arguing his case for having any cycling cred here</p><p>Throwing shade at the brown kit of La Mondiale—ahh, the hallowed cycling tradition 🤣</p><p>Day two of Driedaagse: winning breakaway goes at 12k, Luca the <em>climber</em> winning a reduced <em>sprint</em> of eight or so guys… with a one second gap on the Herelbeke circuit 🙃<br>Day three is another last minute breakaway with a sprint against “the olympian” 🙃<br>(No, this would not happen.)</p><p>Obligatory carbon fiber erection joke lol<br>Casually namedropping Fabian (Cancellara), Jens (Voigt), and Damiano (Caruso? or Cunego?)</p><p>Driedaagse De Panne-Koksijde! (another deep cut, and a 2.HC race, not to be confused with the earlier Driedaagse)</p><blockquote><p>“The Berendries rises sixty-five meters over less than a kilometer, averaging 7.2% and the steepest section is 14%. That&rsquo;s going to be some pull, and it&rsquo;s the second time the riders will see it today.” The announcer offered words of doom—even the Super-Jamestown route didn’t have anything over a 14% grade. Luca and the others would be going the next thing to straight up.</p></blockquote><p>^^ Ok, um, NO. She acts like this is <em>rampas inhumanas</em> at the Vuelta!
<a href=https://thechainstay.com/blog/2012/04/monumental-bergs-the-berendries/ rel=noopener>Berendries is a b-roll berg in the Ardennes</a>, which would hurt the legs for sure but it’s not a climb for climbers, and hardly a deterrent for most sprinters.

That’s not how cycling works anyway, one crash or puncture for the leader and it’s all over. Pogacǎr had a 10 min lead at this year’s Giro and was still worried about losing it on the last day.</p><p>“If he was racing, and he took Paris-Roubaix in a brutal group sprint, there would be a single line to announce the real story afterwards.” !!!!!<br>Winning Roubaix no big deal???! In a GROUP SPRINT no less?? WTF<br>Wins Flèche Wallonne!!! Ardennes and cobbles are different types of classics for different types of riders!<br>If he can do that, ON TOP OF WINNING ROUBAIX, he wouldn’t be proving he can be the star instead of domestique, he’d be a once in a generation legend!!!!!<br>(It <em>is</em> more correct for a GC guy to win Flèche though, instead of Roubaix)</p><p>I think she thinks more stages = level of importance?? So one-day races aren’t a big deal?</p><p>Aww, Davis Phinney! Also name-dropping Wiggins, Spartacus, Nibali<br>She’s good at naming her teams—we’ve got Mondiale, Euskatel-Euskadi, Argos-Shimano, Lampre, Cannondale, and Team Sky, all IRL teams, and she adds Antano-Clark, Kastibank, and Duclos-Wurth, which blends right in (there was actually an

<a href=https://www.santuariomadonnadelghisallo.it/en/the-history-of-the-sanctuary-of-the-madonna-del-ghisallo/ rel=noopener>il Santuario della Madonna del Ghisallo</a>—this part is touching, but I’m so salty I can’t appreciate it bc Rolf DIED FROM A BROKEN COLLARBONE</p><p>Of all the injuries?! Why pick the one injury that can’t be fatal unless it’s from like… surgical complications and infection?! 😭<br>And now I’m retroactively salty at the first road fatality back when Chris’s friend died because this is such a dumb repeat of a tragedy, it undermines the genuine emotional impact</p><p>This is petty now, but it irks me that braincell-deprived Christopher is the only one who notices the sprinter’s bike is geared wrong for climbing. Gearing fuckups happen, sure, but trust me that any sprinter who so much as sneezes in the direction of the Alps, much less climbs *checks notes*
<a href=https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-zoncolan-one-of-the-most-feared-climbs-in-cycling rel=noopener>MONT ZONCOLAN</a>, will know to not over-gear their bike, as will every mechanic, teammate, DS, commentator, and most fans of the race. It will not require a cycling newb from a Colorado bike shop to have this brainstorm.<br>THIS IS ALSO WHY SPRINTERS CANNOT WIN CLIMBS AND CLIMBERS CANNOT WIN SPRINTS</p><p>At this point, I can’t tell if I’m rooting against them out of spite, or if I’m like, sure why not, these two dumbasses deserve each other</p><blockquote><p>“You&rsquo;re as strong a man as Johan Bruyneel. And almost as crazy.” Bruyneel would understand exactly why Luca completed Mont Zoncolan.</p></blockquote><p>^^ Not… the hero you want? 😳</p><p>(Worth noting: circa 2012–13, the Garmin-Sharp teammates were testifying for USADA against Armstrong. Bruyneel banned by 2014. None of that circus is really acknowledged. Main comment about Armstrong is that he mashed the pedals.)</p><p>And now… Vincenzo Nibali wins the Giro as god intended. Fucking finally.</p><p>What’s wild to me is if you know enough to accurately include Nibali in your book, an Italian climber who wins in the Giro in 2013, then use
<a href=https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/vincenzo-nibali/2013 rel=noopener>his palmares</a> as the template for your fictional cyclist, an Italian climber who aims to win the Giro in 2013. See what races Nibali does as prep (note: NOT the Flemish classics!!), and more importantly, what types of stages and races he wins. Ta-daa! It’s like a cheatsheet for how to create accurate drama, not name-dropping Big Mig but then botching your whole cycling cred by having your climber win Roubaix and every sprint in sight 🤦🏻‍♀️</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>If it’s circa 2013, hi Brad Wiggins! 👋&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>She says 2.1, but it’s 2.2—a legit typo, because she already explained
