I agree with Stephen Graham Jones, who writes the foreword, that the cream of the current horror crop is written by indigenous authors.
“But what feels like an even better explanation for why we tend to like our stories to end like that, with bleeding over, bleeding across, haunting us, it’s that it feels kind of fake and wrong and all too American to throw up walls between what’s real and what’s maybe not real.</description></item><item><title>Gender and Our Brains</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gender-and-our-brains/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gender-and-our-brains/</guid><description>The takeaway: 19th century biological essentialism is bunk (duh), and the majority of crappy research in neurology and biology has been undertaken to prove that women are inferior (yay!). We don’t even know what we don’t know, because the pseudoscience myths we’ve inherited will NOT die; but it’s a gendered world that produces a gendered brain, not our biology.</description></item><item><title>Jane Eyre</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/jane-eyre/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/jane-eyre/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Several Short Sentences About Writing</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/several-short-sentences-about-writing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/several-short-sentences-about-writing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Charioteer</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-charioteer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-charioteer/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Last of the Wine</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-last-of-the-wine/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-last-of-the-wine/</guid><description>So very good. Here I was thinking the writing style kept me at a remove from the story and I wasn’t as invested as I could be, and then the last two chapters walloped me in the gut and I realized it had me at the emotional level after all.</description></item><item><title>The Mask of Apollo</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-mask-of-apollo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-mask-of-apollo/</guid><description>I’m reserving five stars because Alexander shows up at the end and whoa, I want to see what she does with his books. But it’s a marvel. The best of Renault’s I’ve read yet? Thettalos is my fave.</description></item><item><title>A Room with a View</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-room-with-a-view/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-room-with-a-view/</guid><description>It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
Wow. Re-read in one sitting. I was only going to read the Florence bits, but then I just didn’t stop. This is why I’m a fan of coming back to books at different ages with different eyes and different contexts, because it makes them different books.</description></item><item><title>Howards End</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/howards-end/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/howards-end/</guid><description>At least this one holds up to my initial perception; it’s still my least favorite of the Forster novels.* The energy and wit are a feast for the senses, especially in the dialogue, but it’s so much about England and Empire, it gets, dare I say… tiresome?</description></item><item><title>Word by Word</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/word-by-word/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/word-by-word/</guid><description>I love words, I love English, and there is no way I could be a lexicographer. I will never read a dictionary the same way again. This was even more interesting than I hoped it would be.
