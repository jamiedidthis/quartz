It feels like a work of art, not just a novel.</description></item><item><title>The Dawn of Everything</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</guid><description>A concept I am on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question.

It’s fantastic, the character work, the structure, the narrative voice(s), the exuberant black humor that becomes blacker and blacker as it follows the warp of history. An impressive example of what the genre can do, no boring litfic pretentiousness here.</description></item><item><title>Annals of the Former World</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</guid><description>I’m glad I’m not beyond the age where books I read can change the way I see the world. If that is an age you can reach, I don’t want to. I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.</description></item></channel></rss>
