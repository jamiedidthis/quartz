Outstanding use of the cheesy amnesia trope, a worthy homage to _While You Were Sleeping_. (Sam is absolutely the British Sandra Bullock.)\n\nIt’s also laugh-out-loud funny, courtesy of Sam’s whole work family, Jonathan’s whole real family, and GOLLUM THE CAT.\n\nAnd let me pay this forward: do not miss the narration. I’ve actually read it thrice, because I got the paperback via preorder, but then my friend Meg convinced me I could not miss the audio. She was 100% correct. And then I started the audio again over the long Thanksgiving weekend when a little comfort was needed. As per usual with Alexis Hall, there’s a lot of attention to dialect, and to hear Sam’s Liverpool voice brought to life makes the story. There’s a reason Will Watt has been winning awards for his performance, it’s perfection.\n\n(As if the cover isn’t a clue, the [[series/material world|Material World]] series shares a universe with [[series/london calling|London Calling]].

My love language is elaborate schemes by crafty bastards, so you can guess how happy I was by the end. I wound up on Richard’s side too; that’s how well he was drawn, flaws and all, when normally my heart would belong solely to the aforementioned crafty bastard. (Also, Richard is 100% Matthew McFadyen circa _Howard’s End_, don’t @ me.)\n\nBack to the point: I love it when henchmen get their due.

That might mean I’m missing something, as it never felt explained in the text why the other women hadn’t come to Jane’s aid before now, nor why Jane’s feelings for Adrian would evolve beyond a schoolgirl crush. The plot is sketched out, not fleshed out—the side characters are props, the culprit is telegraphed from his first appearance on page, both the mystery and the romance are a series of scenes that happen without much tension or suspense, and the climax is [[notes/on firearms, trust and historical accuracy|sloppy to a fault]]. One thing that bothers me in romance is when it’s taken for granted that the couple belongs together: i.e. they’re young, attractive, and available, so poof, they’re in love. As opposed to being drawn toward someone against expectation or reason, and all the complexity and growth that entails. It manifests a lot more often in straight romance than queer romance, for obvious reasons, which is why these m/f historicals keep failing me, even when I’m just in the mood for fluffy distraction.","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.450347324Z","tags":[]},"/books/a-green-equinox":{"title":"A Green Equinox","content":"Sometimes you’re just in the mood for moody, queer af British novels with all the fraught gender politics and literary melodrama of the 1970’s.

The only note I would give is that I personally wished Eliza would have been delighted that %%Melville fooled her%%; I get why she’s not, but it would have been a refreshing twist if she was like, “ok, now we’re soulmates, well done,” even if she still made him pay for it.

It’s so clever and so tender, wickedly funny and emotionally cathartic and full of dastardly-gothic-plots-with-a-twist. Everything with [[books/the secret lives of country gentlemen|the first book]] where I was like, I need to read the second book to know how I feel about it—yep. Second book delivered and then some.  \n  \nOnce again it is KJ Charles at her best. And it needs the first book to be so sprawling with its cast, so lavish with its setting, because this one hones right in, a sharp, focused story that _needs_ the sprawling, rich tapestry in the background. A contrast, a balance, that in my opinion is expertly done.  \n  \nFurthermore, I hereby declare: fuck grand gestures for good. I want [Pat/Pran level tears](https://youtu.be/Bqe09a1xL3I?feature=shared\u0026t=723), sob-your-heart-out-and-all-I’m-gonna-do-is-hold-you emotional safety. If your romance can’t support that, is it even really a romance? Give me the intimacy and catharsis; nothing else will do.  \n  \n(It’s not really a spoiler to say KJC delivers exactly that too.)  \n  \nAdditional notes chock full of spoilers:  \n  \n- I am the opposite of upset at all the [[books/band sinister|Viscount Corvin]] treats throughout. Corvin! (Corvin, an “excellent man to be seduced by.” Corvin, his “relentless air of sexual availability.” Haaaahahaha.) Of course that’s who taught Luke what the wider, kinder world looks like. 🥹  \n  \n- Berengaria and Emily happening literally right under their oblivious doofus noses rivals even the magnificent Maisie/Phoebe lack of subtlety/oblivion in *[[books/sugared game|Sugared Game]]* (there’s naked painting! come _on_)  \n  \n- Rufus’s reaction when he catches Luke lying and maybe cheating and stealing is everything to me, as is his eventual excitement at the truth. He’s such a scrupulously honest person, and yet his first thoughtless instincts are to, respectively, lie and bribe on Luke’s behalf, protecting him at all costs even in the midst of despair and betrayal, and then to exuberantly condone a treasure hunt. All of which in the context of things makes him more admirable, _more_ honest. That’s how to make my heart sing.  \n  \n- Once upon a time I said that _Jonathan: or The Struggles of Virtue_ is [[books/wanted a gentleman|the book-within-a-book]] I most wanted to read: its appearance here is the next best thing, in all its kinky gothic glory 🤣 \n\n- Placing the power balance in Luke’s favor, where the cocky, clever, criminal secretary has arguably (and yes, they do debate it) the upperhand on an earldom—heck yes.  \n  \n- Turning the surname Doomsday and its variations into endearments was honestly one of the things I felt the lack of in the first book. Like, how can you _not_ play with that name? I see why now, and am glad KJC saved it for this book.

Robin and Maud, respectively, were the most difficult parts of their own books for me. They’re just so young, energetic, athletic, upstanding, so shiny, so beautiful, so aggressively… “normal,” for lack of a better word, when I prefer crankiness and weariness and a bit of tarnish on the bronze these days.\n\nHere, their presence in the ensemble was a much better balance. Enough without too much.\n\nAnd that clears the decks for Jack, deeply scarred, and Alan, deeply insolent, to take center stage. In book 2, they’re stalking around each other and scrapping like alley cats in the background, and that dynamic ratchets up a few notches here, to my endless pleasure.\n\nIt’s the best of the trilogy, by a long shot. And/or it just hit every one of my preferences in a perfect way. The kinky power dynamics vs. real world politics. The class differences. The exquisite emotional development. %%The betrayal that is immediately understood and admired.%% Crackling tension and careful tenderness.\n\nComplexity galore, [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] style. At least for the romance—the fantasy still lagged a step behind the best KJC plotting. There were some WTF turns, but ultimately I really liked where it went, and Marske wrote to her strengths. For [[books/starling house|the second book I’ve read recently]], it upends the idea of a magic system dependent on bloodlines. I thought the metaphors and parallels of imperialism came together a lot better here than in the first two books—or maybe my expectations, by now, were just more in line with what Marske delivers. \n\nEither way, it was excellent, I would read it straightaway again. Just given my tastes, I had the highest hopes for this book out of the three, but was still surprised and pleased at how well it delivered.  \n  \nA few stray notes:  \n  \n- The whole Roman storyline was utter catnip for me: concept, commentary, and execution. Best inclusion of an erotica-novel plot since *[[books/a noblemans guide to seducing a scoundrel|Jonathan: And The Struggles of Virtue]].*  \n- Actually, come to think of it, a lot of what earned the five stars for *[[books/a noblemans guide to seducing a scoundrel|Nobleman’s Guide to Seducing a Scoundrel]]* was the same kind of thing that earned high marks from me here. What can I say, I’m predictable.\n- If Marske developed the idea for Alan’s powers just so she could drop the line “Master Perturbator”… NOTHING BUT RESPECT 😆\n- All the sniping back and forth that didn’t disappear but got more pointed as they grew closer… that’s the kind of delicious bite the first books were missing.\n- “It’s alarming that forgery is your first instinct,” he said, “but I admire it.” / “If the rules are stupid, sod the rules.” (See! KJC-style is more fun for everyone.)\n- I absolutely loved the %%Robin-Adelaide marriage%%. It felt like it came out of nowhere when they announced it, but I didn’t even care, I love how that got folded right into the happy ending.

SO CLOSE. But overall, the book felt kind of like the menagerie on board the ship, let loose in all directions, refusing to be corralled. There were some structure/plot/writing choices that left me more stumped than dazzled. Maud’s and Violet’s POV seemed really interchangeable for the first half, which is... not great when one is a supposedly scandalous, sardonic, shrewd actress and one is a sheltered, capricious, stubborn young girl.\n\nThe biggest gap in logic for me the whole time: they’re sending MAUD on this transatlantic mission of life and death importance? Who… checks notes… has no experience, no training, no actual qualifications other than being Robin’s sister, supposedly no magic…  \n\nJust… WHAT. Especially when they have Adelaide or others like her in the ministry who would be smashingly competent and trustworthy?\n\nI know Maud wanted adventure, but come on. That stressed me out.\n\nAnyway, I have another theory for why this series, despite some high points, has been rocky for me so far… book 3 will have to confirm or deny.

I don’t think you can even know a book if you only read it once.\n\nThis time: I completely love Lucy. I don’t just feel patience with her, but kinship. It’s not even her book; she’s just the girl within it, growing up in a country in the throes of growing up. Looking at it through Renaissance-colored glasses (and of course Enlightenment-colored glasses) changes everything. I remembered some violets and the Baedeker; I missed the whole tension and tumult of a world that hasn’t found its way into new roles yet, but is on its way there.\n\nOf course it’s Italy that sparks the rebirth. Of course the last chapter is “The End of the Middle Ages.” The whole novel is like the scene of George and Freddy at the pond—dunked underwater, coming up slipping and spluttering, naked, reborn. (My kingdom for the scene of George and Freddy at the pond.)\n\nThe old mannered England is felled like a tree in the forest. It’s all new growth and wildness. Active, alive.

I hate to even say that, though—it was relevant three years ago, and 10 years ago, and 200 years ago, and will retain that continuity with both the past and the future. But the events of 1820 have a symmetry with the events of 2020, and while it’s disingenuous to claim that’s anything new, it’s why I found myself wanting—nay, needing?—to read this series again.

Kingfisher’s aging, aching protagonists, with bad knees and big hearts and a well-honed sense of doom. The plot is a very loose retelling of The Goose Girl, minus princesses and kings and plus a conniving, murderous, sorceress mother. Evangeline, aka Doom, is determined to marry herself and her trapped, obedient daughter to the highest bidders in proper Regency-esque fashion, plans thwarted when she encounters a squire’s spinster sister who sees her for exactly who she is. There’s a coterie of women to the rescue: the no-nonsense Hester, the ruthless Imogene, the enchanting Penelope, and eventually Doom’s daughter Cordelia herself. \n\nIt’s not rah-rah feminism so much as it is changing the terms for who we deem worthy of consideration, agency, and power in these stories.

She’s willing to argue with the novel as much as we are, ready to poke holes in the perfection of this utopia—the idea of utopia at all—to allow in stinging insects and menstrual blood, men and boys who want to make war, girls who are restless with the sameness of Valley life, and grandmothers wrapped up in insane blood feuds. And don’t even get me started on the amazing audacity of creating a cassette tape of Kesh folk songs to go along with the first edition.

The past, after all, can be quite as obscure as the future. The ancient Chinese book called Tao teh ching has been translated into English dozens of times, and indeed the Chinese have to keep retranslating it into Chinese at every cycle of Cathay, but no translation can give us the book that Lao Tze (who may not have existed) wrote. All we have is the Tao teh ching that is here, now. And so with translations from a literature of the (or a) future. The fact that it hasn’t yet been written, the mere absence of a text to translate, doesn’t make all that much difference. What was and what may be lie, like children whose faces we cannot see, in the arms of silence. All we ever have is here, now.\n\n---\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.450347324Z","tags":[]},"/books/among-others":{"title":"Among Others","content":"\u003e _“[[notes/bibliotropic|Bibliotropic]],” Hugh said. “Like sunflowers are heliotropic, they naturally turn towards the sun. We naturally turn towards the bookshop.”_\n\nWhere do I begin? What is this book about? Books, yes. A love of books and of libraries. Books as lifeline and language. It’s about a girl growing up, and witches and fairies and boarding schools and grief and Wales and loneliness even amongst those with whom you might belong. It’s the boundary between the real and unreal, magic and the mundane, what it means to have power and sometimes no power at all.\n\nBut what I really love about it is the in-betweenness of it all. It begins where most books would end, after a battle between good and evil which Mori has lost. (Alternately, for this book is full of alternatelys, it’s after Mori is exiled to her estranged father because her mother has gone mad and her sister has died and Mori nearly died herself.) And it ends— not with falling in love, coming of age, or finding where she belongs, but simply filling in another page.\n\nYou can see Mori’s full arc—the adult she’ll become because of the child she’s been—but it’s between the lines. She’s still stuck in between. It’s her adolescence, literally. The cusp, the not-there-yet. She meets a boy, and he’s beautiful and reads Heinlein, but he’s a friend, a right-now, not a soulmate or savior. She faces her mother at last, but it’s not redemption so much as an anticlimax. She makes an effort with her father, but it doesn’t solve their relationship. An ad-hoc [[notes/karass|karass]] still isn’t where she belongs.\n\nIt’s the experience of being fifteen. The power you may or may not have; the responsibility of it. The untrustworthy world, which seems to both hang on your actions and operate without you at all. It’s remarkably clever, this book, where the magic is simply the natural order of things. A bus on time or not; anything that can be denied.\n\nAnd I’m still describing it poorly because this is Jo Walton. It’s not a kid’s book, or a coming of age. It’s not even the science fiction or fantasy that Mori adores. It’s a story, a good one, and it plays with the concept of story itself. Books are Mori’s language. It’s how she communicates, and you see her just dying for someone to listen and then speak the same language. When they do, even imperfectly, it’s on the scale of another book’s grand revelation.\n\nI love her odd little heart. I understand the way her mind works; it’s not unlike my own. I still feel the craving for people who speak the same language, and there’s hope they exist. This is one of those books you can read all kinds of ways because you participate in the story. There are layers and layers. It gives you what you bring to it. And it’s like Mori says, if you love a book enough, the book will love you back.\n\n## Name-dropping (bibliography)\n(This list is basically an advanced starter kit for SFF, rivaling *[[books/what makes this book so great|What Makes This Book So Great]]*—or really, just literature in general)\n\n- Anne McCaffrey — *Dragonquest, Dragonflight, Dragonsinger, Dragonsong, The White Dragon*\n- J.R.R.

If that is an age you can reach, I don’t want to. I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.  \n  \nThis was McPhee making a study of that place where language and the earth overlap. Beyond excellent.\n\nNote: this book compiles four different previously published titles: *Basin and Range* (1981), *In Suspect Terrain* (1983), *Rising from the Plains* (1986), and *Assembling California* (1992).\n\nThis description of *Basin and Range* applies to all of it:\n\n\u003e This stretching and folding of language, by which the geologist does to words what endless eons have done to his rocks, excites Mr. McPhee to language experiments of his own. In “Basin and Range,” he is not so much a visiting amateur as a rhapsodist of “[[notes/deep time|deep time]]” like Montaigne, who, centuries before James Hutton, celebrated the mind-stretching eons of change: “The world is but a perennial movement. All things in it are in constant motion—the earth, the rocks of the Caucasus, the pyramids of Egypt—both with the common motion and with their own. Stability itself is nothing but a more languid motion. I cannot keep my subject still. It goes along befuddled and staggering, with a natural drunkness.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Montaigne is a fitting companion for Mr. McPhee, who has the same sort of miscellaneous temperament, the same fascination with odd bits of knowledge. Whether Mr. McPhee writes about bark canoes, the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the Alaskan wilderness or now the “Big Picture” of America's geological history, he is offering us an oddly angled portrait of his own mind, an autobiography made up of shards and pieces, evoked in crisp adventurous prose. And the adventure finally is in the prose. In “Basin and Range” the perspectives and expertise of geology become a language for the drama of time. The result is a fascinating book.[^1]\n\n\n[^1]: [Rhapsodist of Deep Time, Paul Zweig, the New York Times Archives](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/books/rhapsodist-of-deep-time.html)\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.450347324Z","tags":[]},"/books/any-old-diamonds":{"title":"Any Old Diamonds","content":"[As KJC says](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2602050279): In which we stick it to a duke. \n\nWhat *[[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]]* was to 2018, _Any Old Diamonds_ is to 2019.

For fear, the threat is now. \n- Jealousy doesn’t seem to be a singular emotion but rather a cognitive evaluation in response to anger, sadness, and/or fear. \n- When you start to feel resentful: *what do I need but am afraid to ask for?*\n- Worst is focused on the future; rumination focuses on the past or on things things about ourselves we’re stuck on\n- Compassion is a daily practice and empathy is a skill set that is one of the most powerful tools of compassion. \n- Cognitive empathy (understanding what someone is feeling) vs. affective empathy (feeling it for them)\n- Shame and humiliation will never be effective social justice tools. \n- We have to belong to ourselves as much as we need to belong to others.\n- Any belonging that asks us to betray ourselves is not true belonging.\n- [[notes/common enemy intimacy|Hate is actually fueled for our need for belonging]]\n- Flooding (and chronic flooding)—I’ve never experienced a little time and space being a bad thing\n- “Foreboding joy,” afraid to lean into good news, wonderful moments, and joy, waiting for the other shoe to drop… most people experience it\n- Tranquility is the absence of demands and no pressure to do anything.\n- Interestingly, dominance “does not require respect or social acceptance.”\n- Narcissism is shame-based.\n- “Intellectual humility” refers specifically to a willingness to consider information that doesn’t fit with our current thinking.\n- [[notes/buddhist concept of near enemies|The Buddhist concept of near enemies]]\n- “Disembodiment often leads to an incongruence between the actions we take in the world and the beliefs that we hold.” (Prentis Hemphill)\n- “Help is the sunny side of control.” (Anne Lamott)\n- I no longer believe that we can recognize emotion in other people; too many emotions and experiences present the same way, and expressing what we’re feeling can be as unique as we are. So how do we know what people are feeling? We ask them. \n- Our emotions and experiences are layers of biology, biography, behavior, and backstory.\n- Our connection with others can only be as deep as our connection to ourselves.\n\n---\n### Pull quotes:\n\n\u003e Resentment is the feeling of frustration, judgment, anger, “better than,” and/or hidden envy related to perceived unfairness or injustice. It’s an emotion that we often experience when we fail to set boundaries or ask for what we need, or when expectations let us down because they were based on things we can’t control, like what other people think, what they feel, or how they’re going to react.\n\n\u003e I think it’s important to point out, especially in this political and social climate, that when we feel relieved, grateful, or even happy that someone who has done something hurtful, unethical, or unjust is held accountable, that’s not schadenfreude and normally doesn’t stem from counter-empathy. On the contrary, it can stem from empathy for the aggrieved. It’s similar to the distinction that when we hold someone accountable and they respond to that accountability by feeling shame, it does not mean we’ve shamed them.\n\n\u003e SPOILER ALERT: I’m pretty sure this research explains why I do not like surprises. I’m not a fan of having to manage amplified emotion while in the spotlight. But it’s not just my introversion and the spotlight piece, I don’t like surprises in movies or TV series either. I know many of y’all will find this egregious, but I normally read the entire plot of any potentially stressful movie before I watch it. People assume that ruins it for me, but it doesn’t. I can actually enjoy it better without being thrown off the surprise bridge into amplified emotion. No, thank you.\n\n\u003e “Each person’s grief is as unique as their fingerprint. But what everyone has in common is that no matter how they grieve, they share a need for their grief to be witnessed.\n\u003e That doesn’t mean needing someone to try to lessen it or reframe it for them. The need is for someone to be fully present to the magnitude of their loss without trying to point out the silver lining.” (David Kessler)\n\n\u003e Re: compassion vs. empathy: It’s an important debate that is frustratingly hijacked on occasion by folks who come up with new, arbitrary definitions for emotions that are completely different from how we all use the terms. They change the meaning, then argue that the emotion is “bad” based on their new definitions. For example, someone might say that empathy is taking on all the feelings of another person, then argue that empathy is bad. Unfortunately, this approach is often misleading and self-serving and puts no value on how we use the word. I would argue that a lot of this linguistic shell-gaming is about wanting to be contrarian. There’s nothing more seductive and clickable than a discovery that something we believe to be good is bad: “Empathy is bad for you.” cf. [[Humankind: A Hopeful History]]\n\n\u003e Researcher Matthew Kuan Johnson explains that people find experiences of joy difficult to articulate. He hypothesizes that the very nature of joy pushes the boundaries of our ability to communicate about lived experience via spoken language. ==He also suggests that because language can shape lived experience, cultures that have more words to describe the emotion of joy may also experience joy more richly.==\n\n\u003e “Tranquil environments” provide many restorative elements that are needed to counter mental fatigue and attention depletion. Researchers Rachel and Stephen Kaplan found that there are four essential elements of a restorative environment: a sense of getting away, a feeling of immersion, holding attention without effort, and compatibility with one’s preferences.\n\n\u003e When we lose our tolerance for vulnerability, joy becomes foreboding. No emotion is more frightening than joy, because we believe if we allow ourselves to feel joy, we are inviting disaster. We start dress-rehearsing tragedy in the best moments of our lives in order to stop vulnerability from beating us to the punch. We are terrified of being blindsided by pain, so we practice tragedy and trauma. But there’s a huge cost.\n\n\u003e Anger is a catalyst. Holding on to it will make us exhausted and sick. It’s an emotion that we need to transform into something life-giving: courage, love, change, compassion, justice.\n\u003e Or sometimes anger can mask a far more difficult emotion like grief, regret, or shame, and we need to use it to dig into what we’re really feeling. Either way, anger is a powerful catalyst but a life-sucking companion.\n\n\u003e Humility is openness to new learning combined with a balanced and accurate assessment of our contributions, including our strengths, imperfections, and opportunities for growth.\n\u003e What humility isn’t: downplaying yourself or your accomplishments, which according to researchers is modesty, not humility. It’s also not low self-esteem or meekness or letting people walk all over you.\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.450347324Z","tags":[]},"/books/band-sinister":{"title":"Band Sinister","content":"If this isn’t everything that’s wholesome and good in the world, I don’t know what is.

The prose (and/or translation?) is more functional than beautiful on a sentence level, but on a plot level, with the overall character arcs, QJMX has some mad skill. Especially when she was writing as she went, chapter by chapter, serial style. (Says me, who can’t plot my way out of a paper bag.)\n\nEvery time I thought we’d reached a point where it was going to drag, nope, there’s a twist, a plot development, a time skip. Never a dull moment, which is more than I can say for most 100-page books, much less any clocking in at this massive length.\n\nOf course it helps that I go nuts for complex court politics played out at this scale. And morally gray (to put it kindly) heroines.\n\nA few more thoughts in list form:\n\n- If you’re gonna do a romance where one (nearly both) of the protagonists is underage at the beginning, then a 20-year timespan to get to the happy ending, with a complete flip of power balance, is the right choice to make.\n- Hurrah! It does the thing I love where obtaining the throne is not the happy ending—it’s detrimental to the happy ending, a problem to be solved.\n- The way the stress ruins Qi Yan’s health is so much more relatable and weirdly gratifying than the superhero protagonists who sail through plots unscathed.\n- There’s an absolutely bonkers side plot where QY %%offs a lecherous prince by kidnapping the young man he’s been aggressively harassing, drugging the young man, covering him in a poison that interacts with the liquor in the prince’s system (he’s an alcoholic) and makes the prince drop dead at first kiss.%% It’s non-con as hell, but the groundwork was laid for it, it’s a two-birds-one-stone solution to a problem, and I was so far into the suspended reality of the book that I was equally impressed and appalled by the creativity. 😆\n- After the following, I’m also impressed with how grounded and intimate a lot of the biggest reveals were. I was braced for melodrama, and it just didn’t go there as often as I expected. Bonkers spy plots but then real and honest conversations, just the way I like it.\n- At one point it was about wide-scale famine and grain storage and the intricate economics of a refugee crisis and that’s the kind of stuff I’ll eat up with spoon.\n- Note: I read the translation by [@meltsmelts](https://jwqs.carrd.co/) which I think got licensed for publication when I was in the home stretch, the last 50 chapters. I was hustling lest it get ripped out of my grubby hands. I think it’s still up for now, but heads up that the official publication should be coming soon.\n---\n## Reading Progress\n\nI rarely do status updates as I go, but JWQS called for it and I wanted to preserve these from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6038954581): \n\n- **10%** My brain: it’s December, let’s just read short, fluffy books the rest of the year / Also my brain: but what about this 300+ chapter wuxia[^1] novel tho? 😍😍\n- **14%** The part where the physician tells Qi Yan, “you’ve been through a lot, you’re overstressed, you should rest and recuperate for 3–5 years.” 😭 IF ONLY\n- **40%** I will never understand why I despise imperialism and am anti-monarchy to the bone yet gobble up a court intrigue like candy. Screw your hereditary titles and immoral wealth, but gimme alllll the conspiring and backstabbing and ultra complicated politics. What can I say! I am vast! I contain multitudes!\n- **48%** This kept me up wayyy past my bedtime last night. “Just one more chapter!” is so dangerous when there’s hundreds to go\n- **69%** You know it’s good slow burn when it’s 212 chapters in and I am filled with glee instead of fury 🔥🔥 (Qi Yan just POISONED HERSELF to take out a rival, we are not in boredom territory)\n- **81%** The inevitable exposing of Qi Yan’s identity is going the way I hoped it would. Not melodramatic but quiet and personal and intensely emotional. Particularly Jingnu’s reaction, and her instinctive loyalty. 😭 \n- **97%** This had me on my feet and pacing last night, I could not sit still with the plot twists. And that’s with knowing we’re fully in HEA territory too 🫢 (QIAN TONG, BOSS MOVE)\n\n[^1]: Note: I was mistaken when I called it wuxia.

It goes the predictable contemporary romance route, dual POVs that reduce Knightley and Emma to a horny executive and a snobbish socialite. Gone is the communal voice, the class friction, the tapestry of complex characters with rich inner lives of their own, propelled by the roles society forces them to inhabit, who can’t be reduced to stereotypes like “country bumpkin” or “sleazy misogynist.” Instead of trenchant social commentary, we get fashion designers namedropped like glitter and the LA offices of Knightley Capital. That shifts the dynamics of the story beyond recognition. (And I’m sorry, but greenwashing the investments of your [horny] venture capitalist, or taking a few swipes at nepotism does not a social commentary make.)\n\nIt’s the phenomenon that bothers me most in modern retellings, where what was subversive and fairly radical in Austen’s day is now old fashioned, so the point is missed entirely, and flattened into a generic HEA and token girlboss feminism, if not an outright regressive worldview. The Austen window dressing without the spirit, wit, or politics. (It works better if you say it’s a *Clueless* adaptation, but it still lacks the idealism of that one too, and the charm.)\n\n[^1]: Not many of the Austen retellings attempt *[[books/mansfield park|Mansfield Park]]*… my second favorite Austen.","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.514348246Z","tags":[]},"/books/entangled-life":{"title":"Entangled Life","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.514348246Z","tags":[]},"/books/everyone-in-this-room-will-someday-be-dead":{"title":"Everyone in This Room Will Someday Be Dead","content":"This is the most strongly coded [[notes/autism|autistic]] protagonist I’ve read.

If you see someone as a monster, it is as good as attaching a real horn to them and poking them with a hot metal poker. I really do think so. In order to avoid turning people into monsters by suspecting them of being monsters, I do my best to keep myself mostly to myself.\n\n\u003e They have so much *energy*, Ursula’s people. It’s like going up against a thunderstorm. I have work to do, I have other obligations, whereas *they—this* is their work. They’re the guild of rumormongers. The society of theft-by-accusation. \n\n\u003e Anyone who takes gentle care of a cow is someone I trust. It’s a more telling characteristic of a person than taking Communion. Certainly more telling than good teeth. Every cow has a secret name that you can discover if you spend enough time with the creature, if you present yourself as open to learning the secret name. There are a number of methods. The one I use I came across by chance as a child, when I was regularly the first person to the animals in the morning, bringing them branches and feed.\n\n\u003e I had loved babies as a child, more than most people do, even. I loved their small fingernails. I loved the way they seemed to arrive older than their parents. I loved the courage they had to sleep as if there were no wolves, no soldiers.\n\n\u003e I am astonished at all the expense and effort given to the useless work of books. Each party forbids the books of the other party. It’s a vanity. Hans tells me his books can be bought even in Rome, he says it proudly, and, sure, I see that. He also says the bookseller has to hide the books under the counter and offer them only to those who know to ask—the books are mistresses. The men brag about them. Another realm for snobbery. And recklessness. I suspect the only thing I would be interested in reading would be a history. But I’m told histories are hated, which is not surprising. People prefer to make it up themselves.\n\n\u003e Hearts and alliances shift all the time, for reasons no better than the weather.\n\n\u003e And that was that. I trusted him, because he told me that the seeds of the butterblume delphinium are the swiftest cure for lice, even as the same seeds fermented in honey water can be a poison if used too often on the gums, or for epilepsy. He saw delphinium as I saw delphinium. As a plant capable of good and evil both. As a plant that required the knowledge and good intentions of man.\n\n\u003e I’m always polite to them, Greta. You’re right that we have to see the good in people, at least in people who have power over us and who will be angry if we see them in another way.\n\n\u003e His defense poured over me like used cooking grease. He saw in Leonberg a horrible place.\n\u003e That was my encounter with the author of *The Harmony of the World.*\n\u003e “Is the argument clear? Is it compelling?”\n\u003e “Well,” I said, “it reminds me of church.”\n\u003e “What do you mean?”\n\u003e I said that I meant that, for example, as a sermon, I thought it would go over very well.

Rarely does a romcom navigate the joys and pitfalls of queer relationships—and just relationships in general—with such aplomb. Every character feels fully realized and faceted.

The stories are brief and vertiginous, mind-boggling and often cheeky. An undisputed masterpiece, even if I’m still partial to [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]], even if Calvino himself would disagree with me (per his essay on Borges in *[[books/six memos for the next millennium|Six Memos for the Next Millennium]]*).\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e History, *mother* of truth; the idea is astounding. Menard, a contemporary of William James, does not define history as an investigation of reality, but as its origin. Historical truth, for him, is not what took place; it is what we think took place. (“Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote”)\n\n\u003e It was from this initial bravado of a few men that the all-powerful position of the Company—its ecclesiastical, metaphysical strength—was derived. (“The Babylon Lottery”)\n\n\u003e In any case, there is nothing so contaminated with fiction as the history of the Company… (“The Babylon Lottery”)\n\n\u003e This silent functioning, comparable to that of God, gives rise to all manner of conjectures. One of them, for instance, abominably insinuates that the Company is eternal and that it will last until the last night of the world, when the last god annihilates the cosmos. Still another conjecture declares that the Company is omnipotent, but that it exerts its influence only in the most minute matters: in a bird's cry, in the shades of rust and the hues of dust, in the cat naps of dawn. There is one conjecture, spoken from the mouths of masked heresiarchs, to the effect that the Company has never existed and never will. A conjecture no less vile argues that it is indifferently inconsequential to affirm or deny the reality of the shadowy corporation, because Babylon is nothing but an infinite game of chance. (“The Babylon Lottery”)\n\n\u003e Flaubert and Henry James have accustomed us to suppose that works of art are infrequent and laboriously composed. The sixteenth century (we need only recall Cervantes’ *Viaje al Parnaso*, or Shakespeare’s destiny) did not share this disconsolate opinion. Neither did Herbert Quain. He thought that good literature was common enough, that there is scarce a dialogue in the street which does not achieve it. (“An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain”)\n\n\u003e You who read me, are you sure you understand my language? (“Library of Babel”)\n\n\u003e I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: *Whosoever would undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.* (“The Garden of Forking Paths”)\n\n\u003e “The explanation is obvious. *The Garden of Forking Paths* is a picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as Ts’ui Pên conceived it to be. Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time—the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries—embraces *every* possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these very same words, but am an error, a phantom.” (“The Garden of Forking Paths”)\n\n\u003e [[authors/john locke|Locke]], in the seventeenth century, postulated (and rejected) an impossible idiom in which each individual object, each stone, each bird and branch had an individual name; Funes had once projected an analogous idiom, but he had renounced it as being too general, too ambiguous. In effect, Funes not only remembered every leaf on every tree of every wood, but even every one of the times he had perceived or imagined it. (“Funes, the Memorious”)\n\n\u003e The reasons that one man may have to abominate another, or love him, are infinite: Moon reduced universal history to a sordid economic conflict. (“The Form of the Sword”)\n\n\u003e That history should have imitated history was already sufficiently marvelous; that history should imitate literature is inconceivable… (“Theme of the Traitor and the Hero”)\n\n\u003e Someone may observe that no doubt the conclusion preceded the “proofs.” For who gives himself up to looking for proofs of something he does not believe in or the predication of which he does not care about? (“Three Versions of Judas”)\n\n\u003e The truth was that Dahlmann read very little. The magnetized mountain and the genie who swore to kill his benefactor are—who would deny it?—marvelous, but not so much more than the morning itself and the mere fact of being. The joy of life distracted him from paying attention to Scheherezade and her superfluous miracles. Dahlmann closed his book and allowed himself to live.

And yet…is it Sade who speaks through his canon’s most libertine characters, or is he an ironist an order of magnitude more accomplished than Swift? I recommend a brief familiarity with his biography and political beliefs, and probably reading his Philosophy in the Bedroom, before reading Juliette. When a reader falls in stride with Sade, and any prudish shock wears off, it becomes easier to discern what’s true to his idealistic vision of humanity, what’s buffoonery, and what are prescient satirical riffs and exposés of the cultural idiosyncrasies he endured in eighteenth-century France. Otherwise Sade can appear to be a mass of contradictions. He respects the state and the institution of democracy yet rejects law. His characters expound on their superiority over other living things yet he writes brilliantly on the equality of animals and humans. And so on.\n\nAgreed. Read [[books/justine philosophy in the bedroom and other writings|Philosophy in the Bedroom]] first, acquaint yourself with Sade the philosopher instead of Sade the grotesque distortion, and proceed accordingly.  \n\nThe one thing I’d argue is that instead of only _appearing_ to be a mass of contradictions, he _is_ a mass of contradictions, intentionally, provocatively, profoundly. [[books/justine philosophy in the bedroom and other writings|As I said before]], I get the feeling he very pointedly and gleefully contradicts himself, over and over, just to get readers to _think_. Don’t take it all as read, even what he’s saying. Think you get his point? Wrong again, think some more.","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.518348302Z","tags":[]},"/books/justine-philosophy-in-the-bedroom-and-other-writings":{"title":"Justine, Philosophy in the Bedroom, and Other Writings","content":"Thank you, [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]]. I had my suspicions about Sade, that more was going on than just some shock and awe erotica, and in _[[books/too like the lightning|Too Like The Lightning]],_ when he becomes part of the dialogue in a key way, she makes it clear that to read Sade as sadism is too narrow a view. I had to go to the source to confirm it, and confirm it I have.\n\n\u003e “I am about to put forward some major ideas; they will be heard and pondered. If not all of them please, surely a few will; in some sort, then, I shall have contributed to the progress of our age, and shall be content.” (from “Yet Another Effort, Frenchmen, If You Would Become Republicans”)\n\nSade wants you to _think._ It’s all to a point—one that kept him imprisoned for much of his life. He’s in dialogue with his peers. He’s parodying 18th century scientific logic. He’s invoking taboo because, as Palmer would put it, that’s the Enlightenment art: mixing forbidden sex acts with forbidden things, especially forbidden talk.\n\nContext is everything. And Sade, within context, isn’t a beast who’s willing to file down his teeth. His pornography is _ideas_—scathing, provoking, often remarkably funny, terribly, boldly uncensored ideas. About God. Philosophy. Crime and punishment. Sexuality. Morality. On and on. There isn’t an extreme he won’t push. I get the feeling he gleefully contradicts himself, intentionally, again, just to get readers to _think_. Don’t take it all as read, even what he’s saying. Think you get his point? Wrong again, think some more.\n\nHe’s a piece of a larger puzzle, and I would argue a crucial one. All these centuries later, he has refused to die, and it’s worth listening to what he has to say, if only to see where we might still be blind.\n\n\u003e _Sade warns that he who would use Reason as a key to open one door opens many, and he who would make Reason a scythe to fell injustices must beware what else the blade might cut._ (*[[books/too like the lightning|Too Like the Lightning]]*)\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e Voltaire’s version of man may explain how humankind came to invent the spade; Jean-Jacques’, the hayloft; Diderot’s, conversation. But ogres and inquisitions and wars? \n\u003e \n\u003e “Eh,” replies Voltaire, “those poor people were mad. We shall correct all that.” \n\u003e \n\u003e “That is exactly what I call cheating,” rejoins Sade; “we set out to understand man, and before we have even begun you are already trying to change him.”\n\n\u003e “My neighbors’ passions frighten me infinitely less than do the law’s injustices, for my neighbors’ passions are contained by mine, whilst nothing constrains, nothing checks the injustices of the law.”\n\n\u003e In a sense, this was one of Sade’s ambitions: to be innocent by dint of culpability; to smash what is normal, once and for all, and smash the laws by which he could have been judged.\n\n\u003e “But, unfortunately, I was in the clutches of a flock of imbeciles who always use fetters for arguments and bigotry instead of philosophy, and that for the great good reason that it is always much easier to impound than to ponder and to pray to God than to be useful to mankind. In the one case some virtues are required; only hypocrisy is required in the other.”\n\n\u003e “It is not to them I speak; I address myself only to people capable of hearing me out, and they will read me without any danger.” (this makes me think of Jane Austen’s [[private/dull elves|dull elves]])\n\n\u003e “We wonder that savagery could ever reach the point where you condemn to death an unhappy person all of whose crime amounts to not sharing your tastes.”\n\n\u003e “A little more philosophy in the world would soon restore all to order and would cause magistrates and legislators to see that the crimes they condemn and punish with such rigor sometimes have a far greater degree of utility than those virtues they preach without practicing and without ever rewarding.”","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.518348302Z","tags":[]},"/books/kalpa-imperial":{"title":"Kalpa Imperial","content":"Exquisite.

The cover and title are not helping the book find its audience, as indicated by the low ratings and confused reviews on Goodreads. I expected stoic litfic *a la* Garth Greenwell; instead there’s surrealism, hilarity, dream states, spec fic and fantasy, myth retellings, and my favorite: the disillusioned Anglican vicar Alan, writing letters from Tarsus and Antioch, heretically following the footsteps of St. Thekla and St. Paul. The writing buzzes with life, surreal, queer in every sense of the word, delightful. \n\n\u003e Paul would not have stood for women priests, but it’s not a theological issue. It’s personal.

One burbling baby chuckle and all of the intricate ramblings of all those clever politicians will burst and seem as nothing. Forget the arguments. There’s nothing worth hearing but the baby.

The uncritical way this was presented, without any commentary on the subject, bothers me the way grand Disney stories aimed at kids usually do, guaranteeing a (patriarchal, heteronormative, often impossible) happy ever after without any of its downsides, like the high risk of destructive relationships, immature emotional intelligence and lack of healthy communication skills.\n\nI don’t mind a story now and then that goes for romance over reality, but when it’s the dominant cultural narrative to the extent that it is today, then the stories that present it uncritically, especially to young people, get an extra dose of skepticism from me.

I’m glad this one found an indie publisher, although in my dreams it’s one with enough in the budget (ha!) to bring the comic book chapters to life. Akin to *[[books/blackouts|Blackouts]]*, it’s a collage of a novel, interspersed with letters and academic journals and emails and interviews, not to mention the entire comic book that Peter and Tai create as they go. Capturing that visually would make a compelling book.\n\nBut oh yes—the story. Peter, a social worker in 1990’s NYC, comes of age in his late 20’s, dealing with childhood abuse while navigating a relationship with his boyfriend Julian, who’s escaping family demons of his own, widowed by the loss of his first love to HIV. Collaborating with Tai (/Tyler), a kickass genderfluid teen, Peter starts to write his way back through his memories, exorcising the most painful parts of his past in comic book form. There’s a whole chorus of characters who all get a voice: an HIV-positive teacher who’s trying to adopt a child with his husband; a Christian bodybuilder/political bodyman who’s the “successful” product of conversion therapy; a model-turned-mystical-guru of the self-help set; Peter’s marvelous and plain-speaking half-sister Prue… and on and on. Steeped in nerd culture, and a celebration of queer culture in the midst of the AIDS apocalypse, there’s more joy and kink and friendship and healing than the heavier description of trauma would imply.\n\nOne thorny part is that various people on page ascribe Peter’s kinkiness to the childhood incest, much like homosexuality would have been ascribed to that a generation before. That’s pretty faithful to the characters and the time period, especially with the specter of AIDS and unsafe sex, but while in every other way I appreciated the 1990’s verisimilitude of it all—not 1990’s through the lens and vocabulary of 2024—I still yearned for a little glimpse of authorial pushback on that assumption. Thankfully though, it’s indicated near the end that it’s not really Peter “healing” from his kink so much as it is Julian meeting him halfway and embracing his own kinkiness, safely. There’s also a *smidge* of Zionism, which feels true to the Ashkenazi Jewish character(s) it comes from, but sticks out painfully with the current genocide in Palestine.\n\nAll in all, a complex book of messy characters that was worth the read.

And once we acknowledge this lack of universality, the illusion that there’s anything like an objective right and wrong in the vast domain of our species’s libidinal relations shatters beyond repair.\n\n\u003e The emotional atmosphere of our own culture has undergone such radical social climate changes that to assume we’re now finally glimpsing a clear moral reality that previous generations simply didn’t notice because of their ignorance and cloudy biases would be stupendously foolish of us.\n\n\u003e In the days when there were still kings in France, there was King Louis XIII, or Louis the Chaste. On the throne from 1610 to 1643, the least erotically minded monarch in French history was, it turns out, a pretty active homosexual. I’m referring not to the curious detail of his setting an international fashion craze for men’s wigs that lasted centuries but to the fact that he spent much of his reign in bed with a crimson-headed marquis who’d been gifted to him as a sexual companion by his sensible first minister.\n\n\u003e Peculiar as Rivière’s ideas sound today, the medicalization of female arousal has historically been more the norm than the exception. Such an approach to women’s lust certainly didn’t end with the Enlightenment. The feminist sociologist Carol Groneman has traced ==the long and depressingly misogynistic history of reproductive medicine==, focusing most of her attention on those infamously rigid Victorian attitudes of the nineteenth century. During this period, women continued to be seen as either passive receptacles for men’s pleasures or chattel for the purposes of men’s breeding. (Either way, pathological modesty dictated their flesh be drowned in heavy garments.)\n\n\u003e The variance of our natural libidos (even the points at the extreme ends) is the same as differences in our skin color, the shapes of our noses, or our tolerance for dairy products. Just as it’s illogical to judge a person for his or her unique expression of those traits, it makes little sense to ascribe moral significance to the way a person’s genes happen to be expressed on this particular spectrum of sexual diversity.\n\n\u003e Here’s an exercise in the hypothetical that may be helpful for those of you who fall more along the far vanilla side of the Neapolitan ice cream erotic equation. Let’s say you’ve been placed in a witness protection program and you suddenly have to create a new identity of being gay, which is the most vital part of your cover. You must move all alone to a place where nobody knows you, and you must convince everyone you meet, for your own safety and for the safety of those you care most about, that you’re 100 percent homosexual. Now, don’t try too hard to appear gay, because you’ll give yourself away, so be stereotypical but not too stereotypical, yet don’t ever let your guard down either, since some people will try to trick you into revealing the truth by being “understanding,” and it’s hard to know if they actually do know, too, so err on the side of caution and assume they don’t. Watch what you say, where your eyes go, what you do in your spare time, whom you’re seen with, and careful, now, no matter how close you get to someone in this new life of yours, no one must ever discover that you’re really a heterosexual. All that you know and hold dear—and I can’t emphasize this part enough—hangs in the balance. Whatever you do, and in fact you better make this your mantra, *don’t be yourself.*\n\u003e \n\u003e If living under such intense social conditions for the next twenty, forty, sixty, or even eighty years wouldn’t do a number on your nerves (and by that I mean cause “personal distress”), then you’re simply not human. Yet this is exactly how many people today live their entire lives.\n\n\u003e In the history of our species, there have been far more babies born to ovulating thirteen- and fourteen-year-old girls than there have to men who have sex with men. So for social conservatives to draw from that insipid old argument that homosexuality is “biologically unnatural” and therefore “morally wrong” is essentially for them to say that sex with pubescent girls is “biologically natural” and therefore “morally right.” And that’s rather ironic, isn’t it, given that so much of the fuel for today’s pedophilia panic and antigay mentality lies at the fiery heart of the right-wing community.\n\u003e \n\u003e (And I hope you’re able to see clearly by now, by the way, why the issue of “normality” is so morally vacuous and why the question of harm must instead prevail before we can ever hope to make any real ethical progress in these debates.)\n\n\u003e In adopting a patently false but stubbornly clung-to mythology of human sexuality that makes demons out of natural drives, we’ve entered a stage of moral sickness, not of moral health. The good news is that it’s just a stage, not a terminal illness. And as we’ve seen quite clearly throughout, when it comes to sex, we human beings are a work in progress.","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.518348302Z","tags":[]},"/books/pet":{"title":"Pet","content":"A YA book that discusses [[authors/hannah arendt|Hannah Arendt]] and [[books/the origins of totalitarianism|the banality of evil]] in the introduction, then goes on to drop some biblically accurate angels?

This should not come as a surprise, because women in general and mothers in particular are required over and over again, under a wide range of circumstances, to put themselves aside, to forget.”\n\n## Motherhood: role or relationship?\n\nDonath argues a distinction between roles and relationships: as long as we frame motherhood as a role, with a rigid set of expectations that mothers are just implicitly expected to be good at, rather than an ever-evolving relationship that flows between mother and child and mother and all the other relationships she has in her life, we limit the emotional reactions mothers are allowed to have to their experiences as mothers and we limit the ways mothers can relate to their lives generally.\n\nSocietally, we’re used to and accept people who regret their marriages because we view that as a relationship between two people. But as long as we keep MOTHER as a role in capital letters, we’re going to keep suffering.\n\nThis is really the crux of the research—by restricting women to roles we refuse to get to know them as individual people. Where would we be if we told the truth to each other, and ourselves?\n\n## Category violation\n\n\u003e “If we realize that part of being a subject is to make calculations and weigh one’s options about what is valuable and worthwhile for one’s own life, then we can understand the wider meanings of the social expectations that mothers will not weigh their options and make evaluations regarding their motherhood. In other words, the social reaction to regret as a horrifying rationality demonstrates how mothers are deprived of their right to stay connected to their own understandings and, experiences and the intimate relationships in which they are involved. They cannot even pause for a minute to assess the state of their motherhood and their own lives, because ==it is too frightening to society – which depends upon mothers as objects who exist for the sake of others –when they do not stay put as such.==”\n\nVery very closely linked to the moral panics about queer sexuality, gender, etc. etc. In a hierarchal society violations of category cannot be tolerated, because the existence of the hierarchy depends on the enforcement of the categories.\n\n\u003e Since the nineteenth century, nationalist, capitalist, heteronormative, and patriarchal ideologies have joined hands to sustain this gendered division of labor — because without women’s unpaid labor as mothers and homemakers, the system would fall apart - while stressing that this division is ‘natural,’ and therefore eternal.\n\nIf they are so natural and eternal, why would they have to be vigilantly policed and enforced?\n## The ultimate taboo\n\nEven as some of our categories get more fluid or roles get reevaluated, it is still the ultimate taboo in society, women who regret becoming mothers. Yes, women can have careers, but they MUST be moms. Yes, women can be gay, but they MUST be moms. And they must WANT to be moms.\n\nOur social structure relies on the silencing of women who do not want to be mothers, or who regret becoming mothers. ==The status quo subjugation of women is reliant on women being denied emotional agency to feel however they feel about their lives and circumstances.==\n\nHow do we change the conversation? By telling the truth about the experiences that ALL women have, in all the diversity of our needs, yearnings, dreams, and realities.\n\nThe worst thing that we can do for mothers and children alike is pretend that there is one clear path for everyone.\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e When it comes to reproduction and the transition to motherhood, it is crucial to cast doubt on this rhetoric of all-embracing choice: how much room to maneuver do women actually have if we are free to choose only _what society wants us to choose?_\n\n\u003e The statement ‘I love my children but regret my motherhood’ is very often seen as impossible by definition — because doesn’t a wish to erase motherhood mean a wish to erase those children she loves? Yet a statement such as ‘I love him, but I regret I ever met him’ following a painful romantic relationship would hardly be considered paradoxical. In other words, it may be the sacredness we have placed on motherhood that prevents us from accepting that a woman can both love _and_ acknowledge the broader implications of that love in her life.\n\n\u003e On one hand, facing them [the accounts of regretted motherhood] may have torturous consequences; on the other hand, avoiding them may prevent us from understanding social worlds and changing them for the benefit of those who suffer from them. With this in mind, I believe the question ‘Why talk about regretting motherhood?’ should be flipped the other way around: What are the consequences of silencing regret over motherhood? Who pays the price when we try to pretend it does not exist?","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.518348302Z","tags":[]},"/books/reputation":{"title":"Reputation","content":"Lex Croucher’s lols-per-page cannot be beat.\n\nWeirdly, the only character I was meh on was the love interest, just because he’s _too_ perfect.

These assumptions are embedded throughout the literature of evolutionary psychology. Ethologist/primatologist Frans de Waal, one of the more open-minded philosophers of human nature, calls this ==Calvinist sociobiology==.\n\n\u003e Recognized as a way to build and maintain a network of mutually beneficial relationships, nonreproductive sex no longer requires special explanations.

Wilson has written, “above all a form of bonding…consistent with the greater part of heterosexual behavior as a device that cements relationships.”\n\n\u003e If the independent, isolated nuclear family unit is, in fact, the structure into which human beings most naturally configure themselves, why do contemporary societies and religions find it necessary to prop it up with tax breaks and supportive legislation while fiercely defending it from same-sex couples and others proposing to marry in supposedly “nontraditional” ways? One wonders, in fact, why marriage is a legal issue at all—apart from its relevance to immigration and property laws. Why would something so integral to human nature require such vigilant legal protection?\n\n\u003e [[authors/thomas hobbes|Hobbes]] took the madness of his age, considered it “normal,” and projected it back into prehistoric epochs of which he knew next to nothing. What Hobbes called “human nature” was a projection of seventeenth-century Europe, where life for most was rough, to put it mildly. Though it has persisted for centuries, Hobbes’s dark fantasy of prehistoric human life is as valid as grand conclusions about Siberian wolves based on observations of stray dogs in Tijuana. (cf. *[[books/humankind|Humankind: A Hopeful History]]*)\n\n\u003e Asking whether our species is naturally peaceful or warlike, generous or possessive, free-loving or jealous, is like asking whether H2O is naturally a solid, liquid, or gas. ==The only meaningful answer to such a question is: It depends.== On a nearly empty planet, with food and shelter distributed widely, avoiding conflict would have been an easy, attractive option. Under the conditions typical of ancestral environments, human beings would have had much more to lose than to gain from warring against one another. The evidence—both physical and circumstantial—points to a human prehistory in which our ancestors made far more love than war.\n\n\u003e The conditions necessary for devastating epidemics or pandemics just didn’t exist until the agricultural revolution. The claim that modern medicine and sanitation save us from infectious diseases that ravaged pre-agricultural people (something we hear often) is like arguing that seat belts and air bags protect us from car crashes that were fatal to our prehistoric ancestors.\n\n\u003e How many beavers die in dam-construction accidents? Are birds subject to sudden spells of vertigo that send them falling from the sky? How many fish drown to death? Such events are all rather infrequent we’d wager, but the toll exacted upon humans by the chronic stress many consider a normal part of human life is massive.\n\n\u003e Before the war on drugs, the war on terror, or the war on cancer, there was the war on female sexual desire. It’s a war that has been raging far longer than any other, and its victims number well into the billions by now. Like the others, it’s a war that can never be won, as the declared enemy is a force of nature. We may as well declare war on the cycles of the moon.\n\n\u003e To Meredith Small, the story of the female’s role in conception is a miniature of the overall narrative. She sees the popular understanding of conception as “an outdated allegory of human sexuality” featuring the male as “aggressor, persuader, conqueror.” Recent research on human fertilization suggests something of a role reversal. Small suggests the ovum “reaches out and envelops reluctant sperm.” “Female biology,” she concludes, “even at the level of egg and sperm interaction, doesn’t necessarily dictate a docile stance.” (cf. *[[books/the woman in the body|The Woman in the Body]]*)\n\n\u003e Sexologist Lisa Diamond spent over a decade studying the ebb and flow of female desire. In her book Sexual Fluidity, she reports that many women see themselves as attracted to specific people, rather than to their gender. Women, in Diamond’s view, respond so strongly to emotional intimacy that their innate gender orientation can easily be overwhelmed. Chivers agrees: “Women physically don’t seem to differentiate between genders in their sex responses, at least heterosexual women don’t.” (interesting if true?? cf. [[notes/erotic plasticity|erotic plasticity]])\n\n\u003e ==Much of recent history can be seen as waves of tolerance and acceptance breaking against the rocky headlands of rigid social structures. Though it can seem to take almost forever, the waves always win in the end, reducing immobile rock to shifting sand.==\n\n\u003e Author Andrew Sullivan described his experience growing up both gay and Catholic as “difficult to the point of agony. I saw in my own life and those of countless others,” Sullivan recalled, “that the suppression of these core emotions and the denial of their resolution in love always always leads to personal distortion and compulsion and loss of perspective. Forcing…people into molds they do not fit helps no one,” Sullivan wrote. “It robs them of dignity and self-worth and the capacity for healthy relationships. It wrecks family, twists Christianity, violates humanity. It must end.”\n\n\u003e Despite centuries of religious and scientific propaganda, the basic illusions underpinning the supposed “naturalness” of the conventional nuclear family are clearly exhausted. This collapse has left many of us isolated and unfulfilled. ==Blind insistence and well-intentioned inquisitions have failed to turn the tide, and show no signs of future success.== (cf. [[notes/naturalistic fallacy|naturalistic fallacy]])\n\n\u003e People often say to us, “But we’re human beings. We can *choose* how to behave.” That’s true, to a certain extent, but our bodies rebel against decisions that go against our evolved nature. You can *choose* to wear shoes that are too small, but you can’t choose to be comfortable in them. You can *choose* to wear a corset, but you may well pass out because you can’t breathe properly…. The human body and mind have evolved for a certain kind of life. The further we diverge from that path, the greater the cost in terms of mental, emotional, and physical health.\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.518348302Z","tags":[]},"/books/shadow-claw":{"title":"Shadow \u0026 Claw","content":"I think a series that has its own [[books/lexicon urthus|lexicon]] counts for the ultimate feat of [[notes/puzzle-book worldbuilding|puzzle-book worldbuilding]].","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.518348302Z","tags":[]},"/books/shadows-and-dreams":{"title":"Shadows \u0026 Dreams","content":"I’m almost sad I did this in audio because there are SO MANY lines I would have copy-pasted.

Together they embark on the worst ~~elopement~~ ~~kidnapping~~ elopement in history (per Belle, it’s not vainglorious to claim that when it’s true), and what ensues is a meditation on friendship, love, sexuality, identity, self-discovery, society, and *home* in a way that only Alexis Hall can do it. There’s a meet-cute with a highwayman just responding to a personals ad; Belle’s dalliance with Sir Horley’s theologically-inclined jilted fiancé; a wayward, thieving steward who just needs some kink, care, and tenderness; and through it all, the rock solid foundation of trust and support Belle and ~~Sir Horley~~ Rufus start to build for themselves. \n\nWhen I heard they were going to be the pairing, I was giddy with delight. When I read the last line, I was giddy with delight. I’m on record with Sir Horley stealing my heart in the first book, and Belle lowkey having the best background arc in the second. There was rich soil to till there, and still Alexis Hall surprised me at every turn. I’ve yearned for YEARS for a friendship to get the full romance novel treatment, not as something inferior or less interesting or a detour on the way to romance, and he delivers that in ~~fabulous~~ ~~spectacular~~ extraordinary fashion.\n\nIf anything, this third book is the necessary capstone to the rest. *[[books/something fabulous|Something Fabulous]]* is quite focused and selfish; *[[books/something spectacular|Something Spectacular]]* embraces a larger, weirder family; *Something Extraordinary* asks what that even *means* and bares its heart to the world. \n\nI was lucky to get an ARC, so I can’t add my usual wall of quotes until it’s published in December. But I will be re-reading then, and if the first two books are any indication, for many times to come, whenever I need belly laughs and a balm for my soul. \n\nP.S. Reading this back to back with *[[books/liars|Liars]]*, I can’t help noting how it deconstructs the entire patriarchal shambles and arms its various lovers with knowledge, agency, and solidarity. When one can’t yet change the system, that’s the way to prevent misery and abuse. A starker contrast there couldn’t be, both of them telling a different side of the truth. \n\nP.P.S. Peggy and Orfeo’s (and Bonny’s) adorable terror of an offspring makes an appearance and gets told she’s  “something important” by Belle.

We’re starting to see the books written during the pandemic where authors are writing what they WANT, not what they SHOULD. It happened here, it happened with *[[books/delilah green doesn't care|Delilah Green]]*—it’s a joy and it changes the shape of the story in ways I want to see more of. \n\n2. Valentine with the slow realization he’s the villain of his own story is such a necessary twist, and one I hope we see more of, especially in historical fiction, especially with dukes.\n\n3. The way Alexis Hall removes the obstacles he’s set up to the romance is a deft touch and perfect in a queer book that has to invent its own happy ending. Most if not all of them are in Valentine’s head, and doing away with them involves listening instead of making assumptions + rethinking what’s possible outside the chokehold of convention.\n\n4. The JOY in this book. It’s one bananas gothic trope after another, and it’s riffing on the joy and power of stories, the way they save our lives. See again: pandemic fiction. ♥️\n\n5. I wrote a post recently about what it feels like to find out there’s a word for what you are and that others like you exist, and Valentine—his chaotic distress, indignant grief, baffled anger, and disorienting joy—might be the most relatable portrayal I’ve read yet. (Well, except for all the parts where he’s going, but I AM A DUKE.)\n\n\u003e _“Nobody told me it was a possibility.” Valentine suddenly discovered he was quite aggrieved. “Why has this never been brought to my attention?”_ \n\nSo yes, that made the book very very special to me, with whole pages I wanted to tear out and curl up with like blankets. Um... metaphorically? That makes sense, right? Anyway—zany tropes, real emotion.

But that will have to happen one day—I can’t get my brain to arrange it. For now, I’ll make do with a bunch of exclamations and quotes.\n\nValentine!\n\n\u003e Valentine—who, due to what Peggy presumed was ducal inexperience of manual labour, had still to learn that the best thing to do in a hole was stop digging.\n\nBonny!\n\n\u003e “Oh my God.” Bonny threw his arms wide in despair. “You people have no emotional stamina. You’d never survive in a novel.”\n\nBelle low-key having the second-best arc of the book, right after Peggy, with all her chaotic self-discovery. 🥹\n\n\u003e “I mean,” said Peggy. “I used to wish I had the knack of falling in love with uncomplicated people.

I thought I had finally found the holy grail, cycling fiction (nay, romance!) that gets the cycling facts correct. The dedication is to Wouter Weylandt(!), there’s a glossary of French terms and race classifications, and four pages in she’s name-dropping Garmin-Sharp and Fausto Coppi. My expectations, below sea level, started to gain elevation.\n\nEnergy gels taste like “chemical fruit with the consistency of semen.” (lol.) Her Italian cyclist knows English, French, German, Spanish, and “enough Flemish to insult Belgian riders—it’s important to insult them so they understand.” (Ha!

And then.\n\nI’m honestly baffled as to how an author could research enough to get the above details correct, yet have it go so wrong. By chapter 5, I was side-eyeing a couple things. By chapter 14, my rant-notes were getting extensive. By chapter 21, I had so many WTFs that I wrote myself the note to “walk it off, Jamie, walk it off”… and then I did, taking a few laps around the room to cool down.\n\nShe fundamentally misunderstands the most basic race dynamics, not to mention the types of disciplines involved in cycling, in a way that negates the emotional impact of the story. She wants me to think Luca is struggling to prove himself while tossing off asides about him winning the biggest races in the world like it’s no big deal. She wants me to feel these big feelings about things that could never happen to Luca’s career. She forgoes the very real struggles and dangers of being a pro cyclist in favor of nonsensical melodrama.\n\nIn a weird way, I’m less annoyed when a writer is phoning it in. To put this much effort into a well-researched book while botching the most obvious, basic fundamentals of the sport is orders of magnitude more disappointing. And if it had less real-life touchstones, then I could handwave more of the errors as a reality-adjacent fantasy. \n\nI’ve established with previous attempts at [[books/the black jersey|cycling fiction]] and [[books/racing to you|romance]] that what a cycling fan wants is to be entertained and to nitpick. There was so much of the latter it ruined the former, and by the time she had botched the Giro beyond recognition (my beloved Giro!!) and had the antagonist *DIE OF A BROKEN COLLARBONE,* I could not. I was rooting against the couple out of spite and nothing could redeem it.\n\nFor the brave or the foolish, I’ve copied my raw notes below, with a few addendums.

It will not require a cycling newb from a Colorado bike shop to have this brainstorm. \nTHIS IS ALSO WHY SPRINTERS CANNOT WIN CLIMBS AND CLIMBERS CANNOT WIN SPRINTS \n\nAt this point, I can’t tell if I’m rooting against them out of spite, or if I’m like, sure why not, these two dumbasses deserve each other \n\n\u003e “You're as strong a man as Johan Bruyneel.

Bruyneel banned by 2014. None of that circus is really acknowledged. Main comment about Armstrong is that he mashed the pedals.)\n\nAnd now… Vincenzo Nibali wins the Giro as god intended. Fucking finally.\n\nWhat’s wild to me is if you know enough to accurately include Nibali in your book, an Italian climber who wins in the Giro in 2013, then use [his palmares](https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/vincenzo-nibali/2013) as the template for your fictional cyclist, an Italian climber who aims to win the Giro in 2013. See what races Nibali does as prep (note: NOT the Flemish classics!!), and more importantly, what types of stages and races he wins. Ta-daa!

And I realized, I still hadn’t come up with words to talk about it yet, how the first two books of the series encapsulate 2020 for me in a specific and uncanny way, a century past the series’ historical setting, the same kinds of stresses and shifts going on in the world, and now the third installment does the same with 2021. \n\nIt IS the 2021 mood for me, in so many respects. Okay, but not okay. Out of the woods, but not yet. Boredom, but chaos. One day at a time. The ground not exactly steady under anyone’s feet. \n\nBut also the glimmer of sunlight a long way down the tunnel. The cracks and the fissures. The exhale. The shift. The amount of vulnerability and love packed in the “I’ve wondered where you were hiding the damage” scene is three books worth of payoff and it’s made me cry each time I’ve read it. I’ve never identified with Will more. And yet with all the serious stakes, the book sparkles like Phoebe walking into a room, radiating joy and goodwill. \n \nI don’t know how KJ Charles does it. Much less how she did it during this year. She dug deep, and it shows, an emotional depth that I dare say surpasses even what she’s written before. Just Kim’s transformation alone is gorgeous. Several times I kept thinking, who are you, and what have you done with Lord Arthur Aloysius Kimberly de Brabazon Secretan? In the best way, because he’s still utterly Kim, the true Kim at the core. \n\nI do need to state one final thing: my undying devotion for a book that FINALLY makes the threat of an inherited title the worst possible outcome to be avoided at all costs. She takes the marriage of convenience trope (darling, we must commit ourselves prematurely to secure title, wealth, and societal approval) and does the inverse (Darling, we must rid ourselves of this blight at all costs because it will quite literally be the end of life and love as we know it and the only way we’ll be whole and healthy is to refuse to participate). \n\nI keep thinking, this is what happens when you really queer history. Or, eh, queer the pulp fiction version of it anyway. You get to consider the inverse of things. Disrupt the idea, for one, that love = possession, or that there’s any scarcity in it. Explore the margins. Question the narrative. Rethink a few key assumptions. Step outside prescribed roles. See what else is possible when guided by tenderness and vulnerability, instead of propriety and power.\n\nWhat other tropes—what other trajectories of history—what other scripts that we follow—could be turned upside down?","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.52234836Z","tags":[]},"/books/sugared-game":{"title":"The Sugared Game","content":"The reason it takes me a week to read a book that I literally can’t put down is because I read it twice.  \n  \nWhen I read *[[books/slippery creatures|Slippery Creatures]]*, I wanted to say, this is what it looks like when an author levels up. I refrained, but I’m not going to wait til book three to say it: this is what it looks like when an author levels up.  \n  \nThe Will/Kim dynamic isn’t one I’ve seen her write before. Especially with Phoebe and Maisie taking such an integral part; especially given that it gets three books to play out. She takes her time in setting up the layers of trust and conflict, and it builds up as beautifully as anything could. I like books that build. I tend to use “slow burn” derogatorily because too often it’s stalling, and it’s not a good descriptor here either. But there’s a long, slow build over two books now and counting, all with satisfactory payoffs each step of the way, all with the fun, pulpy trappings of the genre, and it feels so deeply gratifying that I go speechless like Will, confounded and impressed.  \n  \nThe plot hustles, the characters twist and develop, and yet what sticks out to me is how much talking there is. Scene after scene after long scene after chapter of Will and Kim talking, a whole book of Will and Kim talking, in a way that feels like what a romance should be. I know an author’s got me completely when the conversation is even better than the sex. And it’s _really_ good sex.  \n  \nOh yeah, and remember how Will was my favorite? Nope, Kim. Kim, Kim. Kim all the way. Although Phoebe nearly steals it, the secret heart of the book, lighting up rooms and sliding down banisters into brawls. Watching her and Maisie is like a book within a book, taking place under the boys’ oblivious noses. It’s a treat.  \n  \nThe book ends on more a promise than a cliffhanger, with more good things to come. Just the blurb has me tingling because it’s gonna go where I hoped. (Kim. Kim’s family. Kim’s demons.) I’m not gonna toss off a blithe “can’t wait,” because I can, and it will be so very worth it.

Reading them side by side: Mitchell’s version is what we expect spiritual texts to be; Le Guin’s is what spiritual texts _should_ be.\n\nIn the introduction, he says he played with the text, but there’s very little playfulness involved. He also claims to exhort femininity, but the main way he does this is just by swapping ‘she’ for ‘he’ at various points. (Where neither is necessary; note how Le Guin fails to need either, which is truer to the original text.)\n\nAlso, he’s very quick to denounce that _wei wu wei_ could be passivity. Oh no! It’s like an athlete! Le Guin, in contrast, isn’t scared off by passivity (see also: *[[books/the lathe of heaven|Lathe of Heaven]]*).\n\nHis metaphor is an athlete “in the zone”; hers is a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers: “uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force.” Note the profound difference in those images.\n\nIncidentally, Le Guin comments on Mitchell’s translation, which I had forgotten and didn’t find again until I read her translation notes at the end of the book. It’s one of the versions that blur the language into dullness and vagueness, she says. “Lao Tzu is tough-minded. He is tender-minded. He is never, under any circumstances, squashy-minded.

I find their incredible disdain for their own health moving. It pleads in favor of what they should be forgiven for. Basically, it is total innocence. ==Cyclists do not dope out of calculation or to make a career: those reasons only come afterward. They dope gratuitously, they do it because it is good.== Because to ride that fast is such a wonderful experience that it makes caution irrelevant. Such a great experience that you would give your life to go through it again. That is what I forgive them for and even what makes them so pure in my opinion. They are only looking for another taste of singular delights. Nothing was planned. After their first rides, they went from surprise to surprise. Whatever you may think of early vocations, none of these riders had any idea of what was awaiting them. You can dream of results, and work for them, but that is not yet living them.\n\n---\n\n### Pull quotes\n\n \u003e They ride around the area like butterflies around a lamp, briefly turned away from their course by an occasional burn.\n \n \u003e Cyclists see their bodies in a very peculiar way.

I’d add C. Thi Nguyen’s [[notes/playfulness vs epistemic traps|playfulness vs epistemic traps]] too. \n\nA concept I am utterly on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says vastly more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question. \n\nFor example: in trying to locate the so-called “agricultural revolution,” we look only for the traits we expect and overlook anything that doesn’t conform. We’re not looking for play, or seasonal variations of social structures, or the essential involvement of women, so that has been left out of the story. \n\nWe need to approach the evidence of the human past with fresh eyes. Read nonfiction as fiction. Are there not more interesting and important questions we could be asking?\n\n* Even [[authors/jean-jacques rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[authors/thomas hobbes|Hobbes]] is like having a Garden of Eden, there was once some “original state” more natural than the rest \n* A false premise, a false binary—helpful once upon a time to shake out some older ideas, but now it’s getting us nowhere\n* “Inequality” is almost a fatalistic acceptance, some condition that can only be tweaked instead of ended (kings or governments can be overthrown, a vague notion cannot)\n* We imagine people in the past to be more dumb/“primitive” than we are\n* Europe got their form of government from China\n\n\u003e This is not, then, a book about the origins of inequality. But it aims to answer many of the same questions in a different way. There is no doubt that something has gone terribly wrong with the world. A very small percentage of its population do control the fates of almost everyone else, and they are doing it in an increasingly disastrous fashion. To understand how this situation came about, we should trace the problem back to what first made possible the emergence of kings, priests, overseers and judges. But we no longer have the luxury of assuming we already know in advance what the precise answers will turn out to be.\n\n* This different view of the past is basically [[notes/science fiction futures|science fictional behaviors]]\n* The myth of the agricultural revolution \n* Seasonal variations of social structure  (reminds me of seasonal gender in *[[books/the left hand of darkness|The Left Hand of Darkness]]*\n* Also seasonal flooding with flood retreat farming (cf.

Instead of hewing wood, tilling fields and carrying water, they found ways of ‘persuading’ nature to do much of this labour for them. Theirs was not a science of domination and classification, but one of bending and coaxing, nurturing and cajoling, or even tricking the forces of nature, to increase the likelihood of securing a favourable outcome. Their ‘laboratory’ was the real world of plants and animals, whose innate tendencies they exploited through close observation and experimentation. This Neolithic mode of cultivation was, moreover, highly successful.\n\n* History’s first city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the environment, or on each other\n* I was keeping an eye out for Alfred Kroeber’s work (it’s there, first referenced on page 199, the 378!), but they do me one further and cite Le Guin herself, specifically ‘The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas’. \n\n## Rebuttals\n\nSome thoughtful pushback [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4614842121), among others.\n\nHowever, a lot of the negative reviews seem to want a new level of certainty, backed up by Facts™, and I can’t help but think that’s missing the point of the book.

She shows how debility, disability, and capacity together constitute an assemblage that states use to control populations. Puar’s analysis culminates in an interrogation of Israel’s policies toward Palestine, in which she outlines how Israel brings Palestinians into biopolitical being by designating them available for injury. Supplementing its right to kill with what Puar calls the right to maim, the Israeli state relies on liberal frameworks of disability to obscure and enable the mass debilitation of Palestinian bodies.

Each sentence is exuberant, profound, precise, often scathingly funny—fragments that kaleidoscope by the end into a brilliant, emotional whole.\n\nI’m gonna steal [So Mayer’s phrase](https://www.lunate.co.uk/features/books-of-the-year-2023), because I don’t know how to sum it up better than “a work of Le Guinian complexity about unbecoming a messiah.” The unreal meets the real, a slippery form of time travel, worlds layered atop each other, the past made and unmade, ordered and disordered, a dozen times over by our rapacious empires and our unchosen ones.\n\n\u003e “They’re our mistakes, I suppose… it’s not surprising they’re so hungry to haunt us—the histories we forgot, the crimes we buried. Devils know I’ve buried mine.”\n\n Given that Chandrasekera wrote this one to, quote, [suit the market](https://vajra.me/2024/01/25/walpolitics/), I’m even more excited to see what he unleashes in *Rakesfall* this summer. And give [his blog](https://vajra.me/blog/) a follow—his essays have rapidly become some of the best in my rss feed.\n \n---\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e Fetter isn’t even the only feral child of a messiah in his social network. There’s a support group for unchosen ones, which was recommended to him by the therapist he’s been seeing ever since he learned what a therapist was. He attends those support group meetings religiously, every Haruday at sundown. He hasn’t told Hej about any of that yet, but he doesn’t feel like he’s hiding anything. It’s early days, and he feels like he has time. He luxuriates in that feeling, stretching out in it like a cat in the sun. He supposes this is what happiness feels like. It’s an effort to stay grounded in it.\n\n\u003eCloser to home, the Luriati hinterlands are sick with violence; he learns slowly to read between the headlines, to understand that a riot is a pogrom, and that when a monk of the Path Behind is on TV calling for peace from both sides, that it means that the Path Behind is once again attempting to cull the hinterlands of the pathless, and of the races and castes that they consider low and other: his father’s legacy conjoined with the droppings of imperial Alab. Too, he learns there is plague abroad in the distant southeastern subcontinent of Aggiopa, where all those empire-builders came from, endlessly infecting and re-infecting the world. Fetter isn’t ready to grapple with a world so enlarged, so bloated from pain.\n\n\u003e It is obvious that they fear infection, but infection by disease or ideas or identities?\n\n\u003e In its own way, it is the perfect distillation of everything that is good about Luriat; the freedoms it gives, to those allowed to accept them; the space it creates for its citizens to make, to see, to hear, to be art, if they so desire and as long as that art does not cross the invisible lines of force that would bring down the boots and the drums.\n\n\u003e They were a cult, the first cult we had ever known, and we had no defenses against them. They infected us with strange ideas from the south-west. They brought doctrines of shame and disgust for the body and the glorification of the perfected mind. They asked us to look at our bodies not as the clean and perfect instruments of living that we had known, but as bags of flesh containing the thirty-one parts of impurity: the hairs of the head and the body; the nails and the teeth; the skin, flesh, and tendons; the bones and marrow; the heart, liver, and kidneys; the lungs, pleurae, and spleen; the intestines large and small—the shit and undigested food; the bile, phlegm, and pus; the blood, sweat, and tears; the fat, sebum, and spit; the mucus, the synovial fluid, the piss. They asked us to reflect on this and be repulsed: is the body not disgusting?\n\u003e \n\u003e Like this, they brought endless categorizations and subcategorizations and enumerations of being and experience. They brought, almost incidentally, the politics they knew, of centralization, of the consolidation of power, a politics of thrones.\n\n\u003e No one in this group is entirely present, not even Fetter. Everyone is neck-deep in plot, entangled in things that are too complicated to even talk about.\n\n\u003e They are all unchosen too; it’s just that the degree of their unchoosing is greater because they were never almost-chosen. Perhaps that distinction is finer than he’d thought. It means there’s no such thing as ordinary people.\n\n\u003e Fame, she says, is how a ruling class conditions artists to docility and incorporates their work to lesser ends. Sedition, unrest, and even revolution are useful to political actors currently out of power.\n\n\u003e Fetter himself thinks of the law less as strategic or rule-based and more as a muddled, dangerous beast. A rabid leopard, like Caduv’s character in the play. None of the others understand that the law might do anything, at any time, to anyone, and justify itself any way it likes—it is feral, like the invisible laws and powers of the world of which it is a pale imitation. It’s because none of them can see the devils, he thinks. That’s why they’re all so optimistic about worldly law.\n\n\u003e This is how the thought comes at him; sidelong, clinging to the back of another thought like a tick, or a child.\n\n\u003e He thinks of Hej and he aches. He thinks of Hej’s face, his smile, his hands, the low burr of his voice, the scratching of his beard. He aches, but there is also a low shameful breathing out, release, relief. All those lies of omission, all the secrets he’s kept; he can let go of that guilt from never opening up, never sharing his truth, never loving more than he feared.\n\n\u003e There is a reason the older term for devils is invisible laws and powers, Fetter reminds himself. Mother-of-Glory taught him this, and he’s seen it in his reading, deep in the heart of abstruse footnotes. The devils are not a people or a species. They don’t groom or fuck or fight or die. They may not be alive, or even truly be a them, as he understands the theory, not beings with a consciousness or sense of self that a mortal would recognize. They are principles of the world’s operation. They are gears and wheels; they are interlocking, grinding teeth. Or so it is supposed, at the most sophisticated level of mortal thought that he has ever encountered. There is no telling if this is any more or less true than the childhood terror of monsters that they still evoke in him.\n\n\u003e Even manipulation would speak of a kind of care that’s absent in this room. They don’t care, because the outcome of this room is already decided.\n\n\u003e …the no-time of this no-place. The discrete tick tock of timepass becomes a liquid gurgle, as if he is submerged in the unending flow of a river in which the boundaries between objects dissolve into a slurry that passes into silt through his hands.\n\n\u003e But is there such a thing as a type of devil? Isn’t that more race science? Isn’t it just a simplifying habit of thought, no different from the pervasive Luriati nonsense of higher and lower types? Perhaps, he thinks, peering carefully into the murk, every devil is unique and that they sometimes look like each other only reflects that they are kin. What difference does it make, when the devil is in the water at his feet?\n\n\u003e Fetter finds it within him to roll his eyes. “This isn’t death magic,” he says. “Filling in fucking citizenship forms in post-Occupation Luriat is death magic. This is just … doctoring.”\n\n\u003e “You already have a Saint-General and a Saint-Errant,” Fetter says, at last. “Aren’t they a matched set? Order and disorder—don’t they cover all eventualities between them?”\n\n\u003e Status is a rainbow on a proud soap bubble, inflated to its uttermost.\n\n\u003e Rulers love to submit, and the Path has always paid too much attention to thrones and not enough to people.\n\n\u003e “You make the same mistake again and again,” Ordinary says. “The sin of metonymy. I say people and you hear the people. I say power and you think of thrones and parliaments.”\n\n\u003e What is it that comes out of the Embassy’s bright door? Fetter never describes it clearly when he tells this story later, leaving his hearers to imagine a legendary monster. Monstrousness seems demanded by the mayhem. Some horrific and misshapen creature, twisted and ferocious, with invisible tentacles and claws and mandibles. Rumour will draw on old hinterlander stories to speak of devils, imaginatively extravagant because nobody knows what devils look like. The news will report it as malign foreign influences. Neither will make reference to bright doors at all.\n\n \u003eI hoped to build a systematic engine for the salvation of billions, but at this point, the Path Above is essentially a massive umbrella coalition of imitation poperies, strange cults, and personal development seminars, dispersed across a wide territory.\n \n \u003e I’m taking Fetter’s part. It’s my oldest habit, to confuse him with myself. A shadow’s duty, perhaps, but I am not him, I remind myself as I have reminded myself since we were children. I am the Unfettered. Someday, I will earn that name in truth.\n \n \u003e I could never hide unseen in the brain of the Perfect and Kind, which he prizes and holds up to the light of self-observation, but in his despised and forgotten gonads there is shadow enough.\n \n \u003e “So much for destiny,” Koel says, offering a wry little laugh that invites Fetter to join in. But he doesn’t.\n \u003e \n \u003e “The only way to change the world,” Fetter says, as if disagreeing with the part he doesn’t speak out loud.\n \u003e \n \u003e “You’re not going to give me some individualist shit about personal growth?” Koel says. “Change yourself to change the world? Something you learned while meditating upon the mysteries of your own ass.”","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.52234836Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-second-safest-mountain":{"title":"The Second Safest Mountain","content":"What even is Otava Heikkilä’s brain?

The setting, Romney Marsh, is basically a character in its own right, and it’s KJC at her brilliantest with the lush sense of place. Ever since she announced that was going to be the setting, I have been eagerly anticipating it, and every bit of it was what I hoped for and then some. The language, the natural history, the way it shapes the characters, I soaked it up.  \n  \nFor example: Joss finally calling Gareth ‘Marshman’ was the more emotional scene for me, not the exchange of rings at the end. In fact, that may be one of the few things I bounced slightly off of: she hit more of the traditional regency romance beats, as one would for their first major trad-pub book (yay for that!), whereas my all-time faves are when she subverts more of those beats.

It’s mechanistic, it’s industrialized, it speaks in terms of gains and losses, waste and production. The medical model we have, from menstruation to menopause, is about irregularity, failure, waste product, syndromes, symptoms, malfunctions. Birth is seen as the one productive outcome, and even that isn’t accomplished by the woman—it’s accomplished by the uterus, the egg, the womb, all these disembodied parts. \n\nIt’s very dismembered, this language, and it’s everywhere.

But Toadling tried to be helpful and stammered when she was nervous and had beautiful, worried eyes in a homely face. Her transformation into a toad was shocking, true, but it did not involve any inside-out bits or explosions, and she was such a small, inoffensive toad and such a small, inoffensive human, and she went out of her way to change behind buildings and things where people would not see it and be troubled by it. \n\n\u003e Thorns die from the inside out, like priests\n\n\u003e “Can you kill her?” she asked. “I don’t mean… That’s not a request—that’s a question.

After a moment, he leaned slightly toward her, so that their shoulders touched, and Toadling leaned back, and they sat together on the steps for a little time, with the magic washing over them like the sea.\n\n\u003e “All right,” said Halim, and turned away. “I do believe you.”\n\u003e Toadling waited for the but.\n\u003e It didn’t come.\n\n\u003e His eyes were grave. “Some things can’t be fixed.”\n\u003e “We couldn’t change her,” said Toadling, feeling as if the words were broken glass in her ruined throat. “The queen loved her and the nurse and I tried for years and love wasn’t enough and trying wasn’t enough and nothing we did changed *anything*!” She let out a croaking sob. Halim gathered her up awkwardly in his arms and she gripped the edges of his surcoat and cried black ink tears onto his shoulder. “It should have mattered.

One of the best books I’ve read about healing from abuse, dysfunction, and trauma. So much to relate to on every page (and not just because she had the same [Jimmy Eat World song ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-HPOHu8mY) as a lifeline in the early aughts).\n\nIt’s heartbreaking and eye-opening that her upbringing (Asian, middle-class, immigrant; raised in what she correctly calls the wreckage of America’s brutal proxy wars against communism) is almost a 1:1 overlap with what was going on behind the scenes for almost everyone I knew growing up (white, middle-class, evangelical; basically the inheritors of the “American dream”). \n\nThe punishment, dysfunction, shame, rejection, generational trauma, and often the outright abuse (sexual, physical, mental) that just got silenced and covered up. When kids need literally the exact opposite to survive: love, acceptance, safety, trust, respect. A voice. \n\n\u003e I am a product of a place. I am one of many. All of us are victims of a dysfunctional community that was very good at throttling itself while murmuring, “Smile through your tears. Swallow your pain.”\n\u003e \n\u003e It is within this normalcy, this transformation of a unique misery into the utterly banal, that I finally feel empowered. Maybe I can change my programming after all. Because the more common the disease, the more survivors there must be. A whole damn neighborhood can’t go down together in its entirety, can it? There have to be people who escape the stranglehold.\n\nIt’s so validating when the key things that help her heal are the same things I’ve discovered. Note: she does *not* break it down into 1-2-3 steps for healing; these are my own notes, a list I made when what worked for her has worked for me as well: \n\n- Self-regulation (calming your nervous system, creating an internal sense of safety)\n- Curiosity (instead of judging or shutting down emotions, befriend them and listen to them; learn who you are when no one else is around)\n- Compassion (every trigger has a purpose; learn to ask “what is this? What is this thing in my body right now? What are you trying to teach me?”)\n- Communication (complex trauma is fundamentally relational trauma—people who were supposed to be caring and trustworthy and safe were hurtful instead; practice healthy relationships)\n- Agency (you have power, you have choice, you have a voice)\n- Love (love, love, love, in abundance, for others, for yourself; the opposite of shame, blame, and fear is love)\n\nThere’s no single magic fix; there’s a mix of what works for each person at various points in their lives. But there is healing, and hope, and I love her definition of both:\n\n\u003e So this is healing, then, the opposite of the ambiguous dread: *fullness*. I am full of anger, pain, peace, love, of horrible shards and exquisite beauty, and the lifelong challenge will be to balance all of those things, while keeping them in the circle. Healing is never final. It is never perfection. But along with the losses are the triumphs.\n\n---\n\n### Pull quotes: \n\n\u003e *It’s okay to have some things you never get over.* In the span of half an hour, this man whom I had known for less than a season did what nobody in my life ever had: He took all of my sins and simply forgave them. He didn’t demand relentless improvement. There were no ultimatums. He asserted that I was enough, as is. The gravity of it stunned me into silence. Joey was the opposite of the dread.\n\n\u003e My family tried to erase this history. But my body remembers. My work ethic. My fear of cockroaches. My hatred for the taste of dirt. These are not random attributes, a spin of the wheel. They were gifted to me with purpose, with necessity.\n\u003e \n\u003e I want to have words for what my bones know. I want to use those gifts when they serve me and understand and forgive them when they do not.\n\n\u003e The brain’s fear reflex is very real. But it has an opposite force, too, as ancient and as powerful. Our bodies and brains melt into kindness in the presence of one key ingredient. “This school made me feel like I was somewhere where people actually loved me.”\n\n\u003e But more and more, I am curious enough to ask the magic question: “What do you need?” These four words open doors and break down walls. With the benefit of understanding, we are no longer two separate beings floating through these threads alone. We are giving and receiving. Two reciprocal atoms hugging each other through the turmoil around us. *I hurt you. You hurt me. You’re mine.*\n\n\u003e PTSD is only a mental illness in times of peace.

I saw someone call him the original troll—that too, the radical printmaker in the time when printmaking was a real threat to the established order. Blake harnessed its power, provoking the church and state with his unorthodox satire.  \n  \nMy favorite work of his is probably easy to guess: A Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  \n  \nAt the chaotic end of the 18th century, William Blake, radical, takes aim at Swedenborg, theologian, for his treatise on the afterlife. He scorns Swedenborg’s theology, claiming it full of “all the old falsehoods.” In fact, Blake takes offense at his lack of creativity as much as his stolid ideas: dividing heaven from hell, soul from body, angels from devils, sinners from saints.  \n  \nIn Blake’s cosmology, there’s no division, just one whole. He flips the script, giving “the Devil” a voice that sounds awfully sensible. ‘Heaven’ is the staid authority, certainty, order; ‘Hell,’ therefore, according to Blake, is the necessary energy of humanity. Passion, chaos, creativity, emotion, desire. You can’t call one good and one evil, he contends, without an irrevocable loss. “Without contraries there is no progression.” In his fervent vision, we ARE the divine, soul and body together, good and evil together, culminating in his epiphany: “for every thing that lives is Holy.”  \n  \nAt around 15 pages, this work somehow feels like a magnum opus. What Blake calls his “Proverbs of Hell” are frank and energetic: “The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.” “What is now proved was once only imagin’d.” His art fills the page, clotting the margins with childlike intensity. It’s provocative and irreverent, disconcerting and droll, ingenious and moving.\n  \nTo be fair, C.S. Lewis comes for Blake in turn, undoing his great marriage in *The Great Divorce*. But arguably, Blake has outlasted Swedenborg. Arguably, he’ll outlast Lewis too. Life has a way of overturning the certainties. And thus Blake resonates, at least with me, in a way his rivals don’t. The contradictions are necessary. We could do worse than to listen, embrace the energy and the passion, the chaos and the doubt.","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.526348418Z","tags":[]},"/books/wintering":{"title":"Wintering","content":"DNF due to the health scare(s) both May and her husband experience at the beginning of the book.

I will never read a dictionary the same way again. This was even more interesting than I hoped it would be.\n\n\u003e I call it “craft” and not “art” for connotative reasons. “Art” conjures an image of the lexicographer as medium or conduit— a live wire that merely transmits something unkenned, alien. But “craft” implies care, repetitive work, apprenticeship, and practice. It is something within most people’s reach, but few people devote themselves to it long enough and with enough intensity to do it well. That sort of dedication to words comes across as batty, so we speak in metaphor. Defining is the mental equivalent of free throws in basketball: anyone can stand at the free-throw line and sink one occasionally; everyone gets lucky. But the pro is the person who stands at the free-throw line for hours, months, years, perfecting that one motion until it is as fail-safe as humanly possible, until it looks so much like second nature that an uncoordinated clod like me can watch them lob a rare miss at the net during a game and say, “Are you *kidding?* How easy is it to shoot a free throw?”\n\n## Stray notes\n\n* The wonky rules of English! (use the open compound “back seat” in the phrase “take a back seat” but the closed “backseat” when referring to the seats behind the driver, etc etc)\n* Asimov: “My opinions are strong, but not necessarily authoritative. Please realize that.” \n* “Pumpernickel,” traced back to its Germanic origins, means “fart goblin” \n* Worcester’s publishers steadfastly refused to bow to the vulgarity of cheap advertising, while the Merriam brothers went bonkers for it. “Get the best!” ads in 1849 proclaimed and never really stopped. \n* “She looked world-weary, like a circus clown two shows away from retirement, dolefully waiting for the inevitable pie right in the smacker.”\n* They’ll notice errors, but you can’t notice excellence in a dictionary because it consists of a lack of errors.\n\n---\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e “The fact is that many of the things that are presented to us as rules are really just the of-the-moment preferences of people who have had the opportunity to get their opinions published and whose opinions end up being reinforced and repeated down the ages as Truth.” p. 48\n\n\u003e The history of English is full of messiness and illogic because the English language is a true democracy, built entirely by the people who use and have used it, and people, generally speaking, are messy and illogical. p. 182\n\n\u003e Etymological fallacy is the worst sort of pedantry: a meaningless personal opinion trying to dress itself up as concern for preserving historical principles. It misses that language changes itself is a historical principle: a language that doesn’t change is a dead language, and as much as etymological fallacists seem to love the purity of Latin, you’ll notice that none of them have abandoned that whore English for it. p. 184\n\n\u003e Like everyone else, lexicographers need to move faster. This is, to be frank, nothing new: we have always felt the heavy thumb of business concerns whenever we define. And while defining gets easier with experience, and the easier it is to do something, the faster you can do it, there is a terminal velocity in lexicography. After a certain point, you simply can’t go any faster; to do so compromises the quality of what you’re doing. p. 259\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.526348418Z","tags":[]},"/books/yellowface":{"title":"Yellowface","content":"After witnessing the accidental death of her frenemy Athena Liu, failed author June Hayward refashions herself as Juniper Song and steals Athena’s posthumous masterpiece to pass it off as her own.

It’s compulsively readable, as dishy as a Buzzfeed scoop, a horror-thriller of The Discourse™ and the chronically online. True to RF Kuang form, though, it repeatedly goes after the lowest hanging fruit in frustrating fashion, and, not unlike *Babel*, seemingly condemns the status quo while actually reinforcing it.

I’m almost ready for a solid three-star mediocre read to decompress. A lucky number 13 once again, but that’s with stranding four (excellent) books that I’m within a couple chapters of finishing—stay tuned for September.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/evil eye|Evil Eye]]* — [[authors/etaf rum|Etaf Rum]] (2023)\n\nThis is why I wanted to read more Etaf Rum. This is the book I knew she had in her. It’s just as brilliant and damning a portrait of a toxic marriage as *[[books/liars|Liars]]* was, with the added generational trauma and displacement of a Palestinian family. Those are the parts that brought tears to my eyes, the glimpses of the nakba and the camps, the unspeakable loss, the traditions and meals Yara preserves even in the mountains of North Carolina. It does one another beautiful thing that *Liars* doesn’t do, too—it’s not so insular, it’s ultimately friendship and connection that break the spell of isolation and grief and help Yara find her way out. It’s a love story in the end, between a mother and her daughters, between two best friends, between a woman and herself. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/lessons from cruising|Lessons from Cruising]]* — [[authors/martin goodman|Martin Goodman]] (2024)\n\nJoke’s on me, because I picked up this ARC for the last story, a retelling of *Billy Budd* from Captain Vere’s point of view. I figured I’d sample the rest; instead I went down the buffet line and inhaled them all. Rarely do I like *every* story in a short story collection, but that’s what Goodman’s done to me. The cover and title are not helping the book find its audience, as indicated by the low ratings and confused reviews on Goodreads. I expected stoic litfic *a la* Garth Greenwell; instead there’s surrealism, hilarity, dream states, spec fic and fantasy, myth retellings, and my favorite: the disillusioned Anglican vicar Alan, writing letters from Tarsus and Antioch, heretically following the footsteps of St. Thekla and St. Paul. The writing buzzes with life, surreal, queer in every sense of the word, delightful. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a sorceress comes to call|A Sorceress Comes to Call]]* — [[authors/t kingfisher|T. Kingfisher]] (2024)\n\nI’m here all day long for T. Kingfisher’s aging, aching protagonists, with bad knees and big hearts and a well-honed sense of doom. The plot is a very loose retelling of The Goose Girl, minus princesses and kings and plus a conniving, murderous, sorceress mother. Evangeline, aka Doom, is determined to marry herself and her trapped, obedient daughter to the highest bidders in proper Regency-esque fashion, plans thwarted when she encounters a squire’s spinster sister who sees her for exactly who she is. There’s a coterie of women to the rescue: the no-nonsense Hester, the ruthless Imogene, the enchanting Penelope, and eventually Doom’s daughter Cordelia herself. \n\nIt’s not rah-rah feminism so much as it is changing the terms for who we deem worthy of consideration, agency, and power in these stories. In T. Kingfisher fashion, that includes the animal world as well. I’d happily read a whole series of Hester, her geese, and her friends (including Richard) living their best life and thwarting monsters in whatever form they take. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/hot earl summer|Hot Earl Summer]]* — [[authors/erica ridley|Erica Ridley]] (2024)\n\nA goofy, over-the-top farce with the volume dialed up to 11. Which seems *absurd* to complain about, given how I just read and loved *[[books/something extraordinary|Something Extraordinary]]*—surely if anything is dialed up to 11 it’s the Tarletons. But Alexis Hall grounds his farce with deep emotion and intimacy, using it to scratch away at the actual farce of a society that dictates such rigid, preposterous roles. I feel Erica Ridley wanting to do something similar, but it stays at the superficial level, with ripped abs and lust at first sight and a relationship that’s just as conventional as you please, apart from a heroine with a sword. I applaud the found family and the chronic disability rep, but without deeper character work, this veers into cartoonish and (she winces) boring territory for me. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/the palace of eros|The Palace of Eros]]* — [[authors/caro de robertis|Caro De Robertis]] (2024)\n\nMy adjectives for the prose: purple, dense, florid, bloated. It sounds like I’m describing a corpse. DNF @ 15% because none of it is connecting with me, not the first-person Psyche nor the third-person Eros, nor the prose that’s turgid to the point of hyperbole. (Did I just want the chance to deploy the word turgid? Maaaaaybe. It’s such a good word.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the emperor and the endless palace|The Emperor and the Endless Palace]]* — [[authors/justinian huang|Justinian Huang]] (2024)\n\nI kept my expectations low, and the writing shows promise on the sentence level—but on the plot/structure/worldbuilding/thematic level, it falls apart. There are plot twists that change the entire point of the story, but Huang doesn’t write like he knows that. (If there’s a second book, perhaps he plans to explore that further, but it doesn’t come together in this book.) Bummer, because a queer AF update of two queer AF ancient Chinese stories—one of which gives us the origin of the term cut-sleeve—is such a great concept, and one I really want to read.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/ficciones|Ficciones]]* — [[authors/jorge luis borges|Jorge Luis Borges]] (1994)\n\nBorges is up to some delightful fuckery, playing with form, inventing books and authors and universes that are just as, to paraphrase, contaminated with fiction as our own history of the world. The stories are brief and vertiginous, mind-boggling and often cheeky. An undisputed masterpiece, even if I’m still partial to [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]], even if Calvino himself would disagree with me (per his essay on Borges in *[[books/six memos for the next millennium|Six Memos for the Next Millennium]]*).\n\n---\n#### *[[books/how to fall for a scoundrel|How to Fall for a Scoundrel]]* — [[authors/kate bateman|Kate Bateman]] (2024)\n\nA thief and a private investigator team up to solve a theft, and the vibes are basically a case-of-the-week tv episode (think *Charlie’s Angels*, *Remington Steele*, *White Collar*, etc) playing historical dress-up. The plot is as straightforward as it gets—they search for a [macguffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin), they get a clue, they get another clue, they solve the case. No twisty characters or [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]]-level plotting here. I was all set to breeze through it and enjoy myself regardless, and then a bad case of instalove reared its head, along with ye olde hardcore gender essentialism, the kind that bums me out and turns me off. For example, a memorable scene where Harry has to dress like a dandy for an undercover recon (an *Italian* dandy, at that), and the author takes great pains to assure us that, “On any other man, the ensemble would have looked ridiculous, almost feminine, but on *him* the flamboyant clothes only served to accentuate his intense masculinity.”\n\nSigh. That’s on me for reading outside my lane, but my hope for a quick, fun read with heists and spies didn’t pan out. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/i’ll have what he’s having|I’ll Have What He’s Having]]* — [[authors/adib khorram|Adib Khorram]] (2024)\n\nI’m glad the term [tonic masculinity](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505ef872-f2ae-4f3f-847c-8d31ef4485e9_1164x536.jpeg) has been making the rounds, because this feels like tonic masculinity of the highest order. David Curtis, sommelier, mistakes Farzan Alavi for a food critic, and what blooms in the wake of this mixup is a tender, sexy, heartfelt romance between two grown adults who have to deal with the obstacles that a grown-ass relationship entails. Highlights include both of their friend groups, and coworkers, and families, jokes and mishaps during sex (!), the love letter to Kansas City (flaws included), and the rich Iranian culture, community, and cuisine of the Alavi family restaurant (my stomach growls). \n\nBeautifully done, every bit of it—especially the miscommunication, which is the opposite of contrived and sparks growth and better communication. Favorite romance I’ve read this month, and on track to be one of the best-of for the year. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/come out come out|Come Out, Come Out]]* — [[authors/natalie c parker|Natalie C. Parker]] (2024)\n\nIn the same niche as *[[books/camp damascus|Camp Damascus]]*, the conversion-therapy-as-horror genre. Similarities abound, even down to the senior class quarry jumps, which doesn’t indicate any co-opting of plot points but simply how ubiquitous this experience is, the same script across rural America, where any deviation from the script means there will be Consequences. A key plot point involves a gender-swapped/gender-neutral production of *Grease*, which is both fun and thematically relevant. Chuck Tingle nails the horror bits more effectively, but Parker nails the family/friends emotional dynamics very well. I’m glad that both exist. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a governess’s guide to passion and peril|A Governess’s Guide to Passion and Peril]]* — [[authors/manda collins|Manda Collins]] (2024)\n\nThe fourth in a series, and I read at least one of the first three during the fugue state years when my dad’s health was failing, so I have only the haziest memory of it. That might mean I’m missing something, as it never felt explained in the text why the other women hadn’t come to Jane’s aid before now, nor why Jane’s feelings for Adrian would evolve beyond a schoolgirl crush. The plot is sketched out, not fleshed out—the side characters are props, the culprit is telegraphed from his first appearance on page, both the mystery and the romance are a series of scenes that happen without much tension or suspense, and the climax is [[notes/on firearms, trust and historical accuracy|sloppy to a fault]]. One thing that bothers me in romance is when it’s taken for granted that the couple belongs together: i.e. they’re young, attractive, and available, so poof, they’re in love. As opposed to being drawn toward someone against expectation or reason, and all the complexity and growth that entails. It manifests a lot more often in straight romance than queer romance, for obvious reasons, which is why these m/f historicals keep failing me, even when I’m just in the mood for fluffy distraction.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/we the gathered heat|We the Gathered Heat: Asian American and Pacific Islander Poetry, Performance, and Spoken Word]]* — edited by [[authors/franny choi|Franny Choi]], [[authors/bao phi|Bao Phi]], [[authors/no’u revilla|Noʻu Revilla]], and [[authors/terisa siagatonu|Terisa Siagatonu]] (2024)\n\nSuperb. This is how to do an anthology, where the disparate voices are the point—how do we even define AAPI except as “the other,” non-white? Who is the “we” in question? To whom is that category useful? The poems are sorted into themes of “mourn,” “pronounce,” “fight,” “love,” each as powerful as the last. A cacophony, a mosaic, a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. As the subtitle indicates, it leans heavily on the oral tradition, and I would love to hear these pieces performed out loud. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/one day i’ll grow up and be a beautiful woman|One Day I’ll Grow Up and Be a Beautiful Woman]]* — [[authors/abi maxwell|Abi Maxwell]] (2024)\n\nNonfiction memoir about a mother raising her autistic, transgender daughter and the New Hampshire town that puts their family through hell. It’s harrowing and heartbreaking, a survival guide (barely? hopefully?) about weathering the eye of the current political storm. I’m always looking for books I can recommend to well-meaning people who want to see past the transphobic headlines, and this one goes on the list. (Well-meaning people, as opposed to those who want to remain comfortably safe in their bigotry. Indeed, one of the most frustrating, infuriating parts of Maxwell’s story are those who just want to seem *nice* at all costs, so they can feel like good people, regardless of the consequences of either their hateful actions or their silence.)\n\nTrans rights are human rights, and to learn more or take action, I can personally vouch that [The Campaign for Southern Equality](https://southernequality.org/) is doing good work here in the south. On a national or global level, try [Advocates for Trans Equality](https://transequality.org/) or [TGEU](https://www.tgeu.org/).\n\n---\n\n**Previously: [[digest/books of july ’24|Books of July ’24]]**","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.526348418Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/digest/books-of-july-24":{"title":"Books of July ’24","content":"July was a hellacious month, both work-wise and heat-wise, but I finished (a lucky number) 13 books.

I’m gonna need some dusty, mothballed books soon.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/yellowface|Yellowface]]* — [[authors/rf kuang|R.F. Kuang]] (2023)\nAfter witnessing the accidental death of her frenemy Athena Liu, failed author June Hayward refashions herself as Juniper Song and steals Athena’s posthumous masterpiece to pass it off as her own. Cue white woman tears, as she’s victimized and vilified by the consequences of her own egregious actions. It’s compulsively readable, as dishy as a Buzzfeed scoop, a horror-thriller of The Discourse™ and the chronically online. True to RF Kuang form, though, it repeatedly goes after the lowest hanging fruit in frustrating fashion, and, not unlike *Babel*, seemingly condemns the status quo while actually reinforcing it. (Do not drink a shot every time you read the word Yale.) There are times where there’s not enough framing to tell what is the author’s voice or the narrator’s, which is crucial in satire. Once she discovers the intersectionality of race *and* class, watch out. RFK will be a force to be reckoned with. Right now, she’s almost there, just missing an elephant in the room. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a woman is no man|A Woman is No Man]]* — [[authors/etaf rum|Etaf Rum]] (2019)\nWe need more books by Palestinian and Arab authors. I intend to read more by Etaf Rum. But it pains me to say… I think this could have been a (powerful) short story. The structure and even dialogue is very repetitive, in a way that I’m sure is meant to illustrate the cyclical and generational cycle of abuse, but instead means you could skim chapters and not miss anything. The dialogue is simultaneously wooden and histrionic, and the mystery of Deya’s parents is clear from the start. More complexity, a tighter edit, and this would shine.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/origin story|Origin Story]]* — [[authors/jendi reiter|Jendi Reiter]] (2024)\nPeter, a social worker in 1990’s NYC, comes of age in his late 20’s, dealing with childhood abuse while navigating a relationship with his boyfriend Julian, who’s escaping family demons of his own, widowed by the loss of his first love to HIV. Collaborating with Tai (/Tyler), a kickass genderfluid teen, Peter starts to write his way back through his memories, exorcising the most painful parts of his past in comic book form. There’s a whole chorus of characters who all get a voice: an HIV-positive teacher who’s trying to adopt a child with his husband; a Christian bodybuilder/political bodyman who’s the “successful” product of conversion therapy; a model-turned-mystical-guru of the self-help set; Peter’s marvelous and plain-speaking half-sister Prue… and on and on. Steeped in nerd culture, and a celebration of queer culture in the midst of the AIDS apocalypse, there’s more joy and kink and friendship and healing than the heavier description of trauma would imply. (Longer review [[books/origin story|here]].)\n\nAll in all, a complex book of messy characters that was worth the read. Well done, Jendi Reiter. \n- - -\n#### *[[books/emma of 83rd street|Emma of 83rd Street]]* — [[authors/audrey bellezza|Audrey Bellezza]] and [[authors/emily harding|Emily Harding]] (2023)\n*Emma* is my favorite Austen, and arguably the most difficult to modernize without losing the spirit of the story. I don’t envy any author who attempts it, but this one lost me in the weeds, with pacing that seems twice the length of Austen with half the page count. It goes the predictable contemporary romance route, dual POVs that reduce Knightley and Emma to a horny executive and a snobbish socialite. Gone is the communal voice, the class friction, the tapestry of complex characters with rich inner lives of their own, propelled by the roles society forces them to inhabit, who can’t be reduced to stereotypes like “country bumpkin” or “sleazy misogynist.” Instead of trenchant social commentary, we get fashion designers namedropped like glitter and the LA offices of Knightley Capital. That shifts the dynamics of the story beyond recognition. (And I’m sorry, but greenwashing the investments of your [horny] venture capitalist, or taking a few swipes at nepotism does not a social commentary make.)\n\nIt’s the phenomenon that bothers me most in modern retellings, where what was subversive and fairly radical in Austen’s day is now old fashioned, so the point is missed entirely, and flattened into a generic HEA and token girlboss feminism, if not an outright regressive worldview. The Austen window dressing without the spirit, wit, or politics. (It works better if you say it’s a *Clueless* adaptation, but it still lacks the idealism of that one too, and the charm.)\n\n- - -\n#### *[[books/our history is the future|Our History is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance]]* — [[authors/nick estes|Nick Estes]] (2019) \nAn excellent re-issue of a book that's been on my to-read list since it first published in 2019. I'm glad it finally prompted me to get to it. It’s the history of two centuries of indigenous activism in the context of even broader indigenous exploitation and resistance, and it needs to be more widely known. The introduction alone, how water is kin, how rivers are sovereign beings who should be protected in their own right, not just for the way it affects our human health, should be read loudly and often.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the second safest mountain|The Second Safest Mountain]]* — [[authors/otava heikkilä|Otava Heikkilä]] (2023)\nWhat even is Otava Heikkilä’s brain? There are nuns and orgies and authoritarian patriarchal tentacle gods, and it maps completely onto the experience of being outcast in our world, for simply being true to yourself. As with *[[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]]*, the images are more powerful than words. There are two pages I kept flipping between: Aru thrown off the mountain, then surrounded by the rest of the broken, unfit exiles, arriving to carry them home.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/hanami|Hanami: You, Me, \u0026 200 Sq Ft in Japan]]* — [[authors/julia cejas|Julia Cejas]] (2024)\nThe art is beautiful! The story is *stressful*. I have known various people in my life where, let’s just say their enthusiasm for an idea exceeds their preparation for the reality of it. I’ve suffered the consequences of this (when it’s a parent), tried to mitigate the damage (when it’s a sibling), or offered consolation in the aftermath (when it’s a friend). This triggered some memories that I don’t care to ever revisit. In lovely comic form! But still. \n- - -\n#### *[[books/the duke at hazard|The Duke at Hazard]]* — [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] (2024)\nI have a few auto-buy (auto-preorder) authors, but KJ Charles is the only one where I drop everything to start reading the day a new book comes out. Here, that impatience is rewarded with a tender, slow-blooming romance-on-the-run between Daizell, a disgraced non-scoundrel scoundrel (he’s paying for the sins of his father), and Cassian, aka The Duke, aka Vernon Fortescue Cassian George de Vere Crosse, the fourth Duke of Severn, the Earl of Harmsford, Baron Crosse of Wotton, and Baron Vere, who’s incognito for a month to hunt down a thief and win a wager (he’s burdened with the premature inheritance of his father’s title). If you’re sensing a theme, then yes. KJC is as genius at plots as she is with names, and there’s a brilliant echo and contrast with both men, who they’re believed to be vs. who they are vs. who they wish to become, and the shadow their respective fathers cast across it all. She’s also the type of writer who can shamelessly open chapter six with the line, “There was only one bed,” but then wring the most profound emotional truths out of that tropey confection. \n\nI loved every character (Martin! Eliza!), I loved the kink (somnophilia! the gorgeous consent and negotiation thereof!), I loved the cameos at the end ([[books/the gentle art of fortune hunting|Hart! Robin! Lady Wintour!]]). And now I have to live with the fact that a novel *with a duke* is going to crack my top 5 KJC rankings. How dare she. What’s more, I read the ebook, as the paperback doesn’t publish in the U.S. until October. Which I’ve already preordered, so I can repeat the lovely experience of it arriving again. \n- - -\n#### *[[books/untypical|Untypical: How the World Isn’t Built for Autistic People and What We Should All Do About It]]* — [[authors/pete wharmby|Pete Wharmby]] (2023)\nPart memoir of a late-diagnosed autistic person (straight white British male version); part comprehensive outline of accommodations that would make the world a safer, more autistic-friendly place. Some are so laughably trivial that it’s shameful they even have to be requested in the first place—but alas, that’s the world we live in. A good entry into the burgeoning autistic memoir genre, and a great resource for anyone wanting to better understand the autistic people in their life. (Because everyone has an autistic person in their life, whether they know it yet or not.)\n- - -\n#### *[[books/the brides of high hill|The Brides of High Hill]]* — [[authors/nghi vo|Nghi Vo]] (2024)\nCleric Chih accompanies the bridal party of Pham Nhung to the estate of her potential husband, a man with monstrous secrets. For the first two acts, there are no stories-within-a-story, and no Almost Brilliant, in a way that indicates they’re connected—Chih keeps requesting to hear stories, but people refuse or prevaricate, until we miss the niexin as keenly as Chih does. Chih, however, falls helplessly into a crush on Pham Nhung, as do I, which makes the swift and brilliant third act twist all the more effective. One story is swapped for another, with a literal take on *stories save lives*. Dare I say this one ranks with *[[books/into the riverlands|Riverlands]]* as my favorite entries in the series thus far?\n- - -\n#### *[[books/liars|Liars]]* — [[authors/sarah manguso|Sarah Manguso]] (2024)\nBrilliant, merciless, couldn’t put it down. Jane marries John (Bridges, but might as well be Doe, for all the universality implied), and misery ensues as John exploits the patriarchal society and his own insecurities to make Jane’s life hell. Written as autofiction with a dash of crime fiction, it’s an autopsy of a 21st century marriage between two (eventually wealthy) white straight people, who are best placed to reap the benefits of modern feminism and equality, and instead expose the grotesque flaws and inequalities. I was briefly worried that the liars of the title, plural, would go the false equivalency route, saying Jane lied just as much as John did and is therefore complicit in her own downfall. Yes, that’s true—*and* it’s revealed that the only lies she ever told were telling herself that things were good when they weren’t, that they would be okay when they would not. For a book called *Liars*, it’s full of searing, harsh truth, the kind that sets you free.\n- - -\n#### *[[books/the fox wife|The Fox Wife]]* — [[authors/yangsze choo|Yangsze Choo]] (2024)\nNot the right choice to follow Nghi Vo’s [[books/the brides of high hill|fox-spirit tale]]. Atmospheric, but I feel talked down to and everything is over-explained. This is why I like sticking to genre for Asian fantasy instead of litfic. DNF @ pg 60. (I did flip through the rest because the hardcover had wide margins for sidenotes, but there were… barely any? And just random stuff too, like Snow’s uncle the pyrotechnic expert. Such a wasted opportunity!)\n- - -\n#### *[[books/something extraordinary|Something Extraordinary]]* — [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]] (2024)\nThe high-strung Belle has left behind her heroine era, and the drama-prone Rufus has left behind his Sir Horley Comewithers era. Together they embark on the worst elopement in history (per Belle, it’s not vainglorious to claim that when it’s true), and what ensues is a meditation on friendship, love, sexuality, identity, self-discovery, society, and *home* in a way that only Alexis Hall can do it. There’s a meet-cute with a highwayman just responding to a personals ad; Belle’s dalliance with Sir Horley’s theologically-inclined jilted fiancé; a wayward, thieving steward who just needs some kink, care, and tenderness; and through it all, the rock solid foundation of trust and support Belle and ~~Sir Horley~~ Rufus start to build for themselves. \n\nI was lucky to get an ARC, so I can’t add my usual wall of quotes until it’s published in December. But I will be re-reading then, and if the first two books are any indication, for many times to come, whenever I need belly laughs and a balm for my soul. (Longer review [[books/something extraordinary|here]].)\n\n---\n\n**Previously: [[digest/books of june ’24|Books of June ’24]]**","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.526348418Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/digest/books-of-june-24":{"title":"Books of June ’24","content":"I finished around fifteen books in June, even though the weather got too hot, too fast, for hammock time. Rufi Thorpe swooped in hot with one of my favorite books for the month (and year), but she was far from the only highlight. Let’s give this digest idea a whirl.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/mammoths at the gates|Mammoths at the Gates]]* — [[authors/nghi vo|Nghi Vo]] (2023)\nOur beloved cleric Chih returns home to the Singing Hills Abbey, only to find (spoiler alert) mammoths at the gates, an imperial delegation come to collect one of their own. A lovely mediation on grief, change, and love, through a plot revealed as always in the layers and sediment of myth. Almost Brilliant gets a daughter, and an uncle, and a vast network of kin, and at long last we see more of the inner workings of the neixin (talking [hoopoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_hoopoe) who serve as the generational memory of the monastery). Nghi Vo continues to crush every single novella in this series, creating an ongoing rich tapestry. I’m so glad there’s going to be at least eight in total. (I’d try to bargain for twenty.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/home remedies|Home Remedies]]* — [[authors/xuan juliana wang|Xuan Juliana Wang]] (2019)\nA collection of short stories, of which my favorite (of course it is, since diving is my favorite sport of the summer Olympics) is the pair of Olympic-level synchronized divers, trained to be each other’s shadow, one in unrequited love with the other. Sharp writing, skillful stories of China and its diaspora. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a green equinox|A Green Equinox]]* — [[authors/elizabeth mavor|Elizabeth Mavor]] (1973)\nSometimes you’re just in the mood for moody, queer af British novels with all the fraught gender politics and literary melodrama of the 1970’s. What can I say! So odd and compelling, like a fever dream. (Often literally, as there is an outbreak of typhoid that infects the course of the story.) No regrets for picking up this pretty little McNally Edition paperback either, which, apart from the banging cover, is a tactile pleasure to hold.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/conversion|Conversion]]* — [[authors/otava heikkilä|Otava Heikkilä]] (2020)\nA 12th century missionary finds shelter in a blizzard with a gruff, kindhearted hermit. The conversion is his own, shedding the self-loathing shame for genuine tender romantic connection. Like with *[[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]]*, Heikkilä does so much with so little, spare art and spare dialogue packing a punch of emotions. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/freak pleasures|Freak Pleasures: A BDSM Zine]]* — [[authors/otava heikkilä|Otava Heikkilä]] (2022)\nNow this is protest art. Specifically, the protest of [SESTA/FOSTA](https://decriminalizesex.work/advocacy/sesta-fosta/what-is-sesta-fosta/) and the censorship it entails, not to mention the way it endangers those it purports to protect. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/experienced|Experienced]]* — [[authors/kate young|Kate Young]] (2024)\nBette gets dumped-but-not-dumped in truly shitty fashion by her girlfriend, who suggests she just needs more experience since she’s newly out as a lesbian. Commence a sex odyssey through the wilds of Bristol, aided by her first failed date of the odyssey, the kind and thoughtful Ruth. Rarely does a romcom navigate the joys and pitfalls of queer relationships—and just relationships in general—with such aplomb. Every character feels fully realized and faceted. Friendships are central to the story, just the way I like it—especially Bette and Ash, but also the larger friend group, and the burgeoning friendship with Ruth that matters more than the crush for 80% of the book. There are tropes galore, all of them navigated skillfully, many of them skillfully subverted, without seeming twee, tiresome, or implausible.\n\nVery tender, very steamy, very messy, very British, very queer, very thoughtful. I enjoyed myself immensely.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/ninetails|Ninetails: Nine Tales]]* — [[authors/sally wen mao|Sally Wen Mao]] (2024)\nI love mythology turned feminist, but something about this was so on the nose that it didn’t quite pull me in. I may revisit in a different mood to see if I feel differently, or whether I’m comparing it unfairly to *[[books/home remedies|Home Remedies]]*, which was a better match to my taste in short stories.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/is this autism|Is This Autism? A Guide for Clinicians and Everyone Else]]* — [[authors/donna henderson|Donna Henderson]], [[authors/sarah wayland|Sarah Wayland]], and [[authors/jamell white|Jamell White]] (2023)\nOnce again I have read my way up from beginner to clinical level on a subject in the space of a year. I’m going to make a declarative statement that this is currently the best resource out there, full stop, on ASD and the myriad of ways it presents. The research is still in its infancy, but we’re starting to make strides in understanding it, especially how differently it can present in the non-male, non-white population. Therapists, psychiatrists, and clinicians, take note. (Pairs well with Steph Jones’ *[[books/the autistic survival guide to therapy|Autistic Survival Guide to Therapy]]*, which illustrates why this knowledge is desperately needed.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/earthlings|Earthlings]]* — [[authors/sayaka murata|Sayaka Murata]] (2018)\nYou could put trigger warnings on this book for child abuse, incest, and cannibalism(!!), and still the anguish of being forced to conform to society—“The Factory”—at the expense of all well-being forms the core of the horror. Particularly how women are reduced to wombs like mechanical components. Speculative fiction? Magical realism? Straight-up psychological horror? Yes. It’s harrowing and weird as fuck, and I liked it immensely, but maybe I’m Not Like Other Girls too.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/blackouts|Blackouts]]* — [[authors/justin torres|Justin Torres]] (2024)\nAll the different layers of meaning to the title—the blackouts our narrator experiences due to PTSD, the blackouts of Juan and his fading memory, the failure of institutional memory, the queer erasure from history, the literal blackouts of the pages of the book. It feels like a work of art, not just a novel. Indeed, if you’re looking for linear storytelling, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Lives up to the hype. Could not put it down. Experience the book in print form if at possible—the art is so integral to the story that it *is* the story. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/margo's got money troubles|Margo’s Got Money Troubles]]* — [[authors/rufi thorpe|Rufi Thorpe]] (2024)\n20-year-old Margo sleeps with her professor, gets pregnant, keeps the baby, and discovers what a capitalist hellscape the U.S. is for mothers of all stripes, but particularly the unwed. Creating porn online becomes the only ethical way to survive, and this searing social commentary is wrapped up with so much humor and heart the book practically explodes with it. Her father Jinx (ex-pro wrestler, addict), her roommate Suzie (cosplayer extraordinaire), her lawyer Ward (lowkey one of the best characters in the book), and a host of fellow sex workers team up to become her ad-hoc support system, creating a found family in a way that rarely exists outside of LGBTQ books. (It need to be more common! In all kinds of books! Found family for everyone!)\n\nWhat I love most is that not a single character can be reduced to their 1–2 word descriptor. Everyone is a meat suit of startling complexity (except maybe the uber-religious stepfather, who fulfills his role to perfection). Thorpe also does some highly clever metatextual breaking of the fourth wall, switching between first and third POV to make various points about performance and fiction and the roles we play for an audience. This kind of experiment in less capable hands would be a disaster. Here, it’s brilliant. This will be on my year-end list of best books, for sure. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/camp damascus|Camp Damascus]]* — [[authors/chuck tingle|Chuck Tingle]] (2023)\nI had to wait until I was in a good headspace to handle this. Ruth, an autistic devout Christian on the cusp of adulthood, begins to realize everything in her life is not as it seems, not even herself. Cue the horror of religious trauma and conversion therapy camps, right at home with the traditional trappings of the horror genre. It gets genuinely creepy as hell as all hell is unleashed, quite literally in the case of demons run amok. (I could see where some readers would take issue that Chuck chose to make the demons real, and hell real, but that worked for me in the context of this book. Especially with the revelation of who the real monsters are, and that the demons are unwilling accomplices, ready to turn on their masters for what they’ve been forced to do.)\n\nI wish I didn’t have such a long list of conversion therapy survival books, but this is a worthy addition. It’s the flavor of extreme and homophobic evangelicalism that I grew up in, with all the trauma that accompanies it. And of course it’s Chuck Tingle, so we get the happy ending. LOVE IS REAL. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/wintering|Wintering: The Power of Rest and Retreat in Difficult Times]]* — [[authors/katherine may|Katherine May]] (2020)\nDNF due to the health scare(s) both she and her husband experience at the beginning of the book. Even though I knew they were okay, it was too much to relive in the moment, my own recent family health scares too fresh. I skimmed ahead to see if I could just skip that part, but multiple other chapters failed to grab me. Love the concept; the execution feels NPR-ish and banal.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/kushiel's dart|Kushiel’s Dart]]* — [[authors/jacqueline carey|Jacqueline Carey]] (2001)\nMy semi-decennial attempt to finish this book. I made it farther this time, with determination, but despite an attempt every three to five years, I still bounce off it like a rubber ball. Taboo, kink, AND court intrigue in the same book?! This should be exactly my thing! It’s overwrought in a way that makes me weary, though. And I wish the BDSM aspect was… *more*. More creative. More subversive. More than the pseudo-French medieval fanfic with a dash of mystical Jesus-y stuff and some weird moral judgments regarding kink. (All of Phèdre’s clients are bad people; anyone who’s good doesn’t desire the least bit of play in the bedroom. Say what now?) And! Another thing, if courtesans are revered on the level of divinity and a central part of the culture, then why is the language around it still demeaning? It’s hard to turn my brain off and other bits on, is what I’m saying. I think. \n\n(Either that, or I read Tiffany Reisz’s *Original Sinners* at too impressionable an age. Her take on “kink, but make it sacred”—and specifically “pain, but make it sacred”—coupled with irreverent humor and a thorough theology imprinted on me in a way that can’t be undone.)","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.526348418Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/info":{"title":"About me","content":"Hi!

I was burnt out on the social feed, but also frustrated by the chronological demands of a blog. I wanted something book-centric, partially inspired by Mandy Brown at [A Working Library](https://aworkinglibrary.com/), but even more [[notes/rhizomatic thinking|interlinked]] and [[notes/linguistic play as a writing exercise|informal]]. I started mapping how I read, think, and write (lots of links, citations, and lots of [cf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf.)’s), and started from scratch about a dozen times over to figure out a system that works for me.\n\nMy goal is that eventually, there won’t be a dead end, and each note and book will link to another. An endless network of trails to wander down and get lost.\n\n## Back-end workflow 🍑\n\n[Bear](https://bear.app/) gets all my raw thoughts, dumped in there like a junk drawer. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) gets my edited, slightly-more-comprehensible notes. This site is built on [Quartz 3](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/releases/tag/v3.3), which then takes the markdown notes from Obsidian and generates a  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based static site, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamiedidthis/quartz). \n\nHuge thanks to Jacky Zhao for [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)[^1], even though I customized the heck out of all the layouts and taxonomies. 😊\n\n[^1]: [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is even more impressive, but I’m stuck with v3 for now due to how well Hugo suits my needs.

B. Tylor.)\n\nFor self-identified animists, Graham Harvey explains, “the world and its various powers are neither good nor bad… but open, efficacious, and above all, relational.”\n\nTim Ingold: “We are dealing here not with a way of believing about the world, but with a condition of living in it.”\n\nFar from abolishing or preventing distinctions, then, this sort of animacy produces differences locally and interactively. Beings become the kind of beings they are in relation to the other beings who interact with them in a particular time and place.\n\nThe result of this dynamic, relational structure is not uniformity, all-is-oneness, or a “pudding of one identity,” but “a web of interdependencies.” (cf. [[private/holobionts]])\n\n---\n## The indigenous attribution of agency\n\nPer Mary-Jane Rubenstein in *[[books/pantheologies|Pantheologies]]*:\n\nEach creature is directly responsible for the well-being of many beings at many times, but not for all beings at all times, and these “overlap[ping] connections” sustain a community united not by its identity to itself, but by its complex, mobile, and interrelated differentiations.\n\nAs one might note, however, these distinctions (between the physical and the metaphysical, the this-worldly and the otherworldly, or the religious and the ethical) are rooted in the oppositions between spirit and matter, creator and created, that “animism” purportedly rejects.\n\nThe implication is that the indigenous attribution of agency and even personhood to vegetal life is not irrational, infantile, narcissistic, or delusional (which is to say, religious); to the contrary, these insights are so sophisticated that “plant science” has confirmed them.\n\nAnd it is precisely at this point that indigenous philosophies might congratulate earth-systems science for having finally caught up to what it has known all along; as Vine Deloria attests, “traditional Indians,” who have always asserted the animacy of the universe, “are quite amused to see this revival of the debate over whether the planet is alive.”","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.702350951Z","tags":["nature"]},"/notes/apophatic-naming":{"title":"Apophatic naming","content":"Apophatic naming, or negative naming, is the attempt to call a thing by so many names that its essential nature transcends all of them.

The behaviorist theory is the theory that underlies most coercive punishment in the world, from parents spanking their children to nations jailing their citizens.\n\nThis understanding of punishment is that whenever a subject—and it’s always very objectifying, a “subject,” like an animal or a machine, not a complex human being—whenever a subject exhibits an unwanted behavior, you administer an aversive stimulus. Over time the subject will exhibit the behavior less and less, until it ceases. Easy as that.\n\nThe thing to understand about behaviorist theory is that it’s mostly based on experiments with subjects that have little or no power to leave, to avoid the punishment, or to fight back. Pigeons in cages are good subjects for straight-up behaviorism. Human beings, not so much.\n\nEven with pigeons, the effectiveness of punishment only lasts as long as the experiment lasts. To be effective, punishment has to be administered immediately, severely, and consistently, to a level that’s hard to replicate outside of a lab. Once the punishment is stopped, the behavior tends to come back.\n\nOn the same principle, money as a reward may actually buy off one’s intrinsic motivation for an activity. Under some circumstances the reasons people do things can’t all be added up together. Sometimes, they’ll cancel each other out. \n\nPunishing children produces children who behave the way their punishers want them to only when they are being watched. Punitive prison systems actually increase their inmates’ likelihood of committing further crimes once released.\n\nShame, retribution, and punishment will never produce long-lasting, healthy, positive change.  The behaviorist theory of punishment does not work. \n\n(This was before I was logging exact quotes and citations! 🤦🏻‍♀️ But *[[books/humankind|Humankind: A Hopeful History]]* and *[[books/the dominance playbook|The Dominance Playbook]]* were both valuable sources.)","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.702350951Z","tags":["belief-systems"]},"/notes/bibliotropic":{"title":"Bibliotropic","content":"To leans towards a book as flowers leans toward the sun. \n\nI’m guessing [[authors/jo walton|Jo Walton]] didn’t coin this one so much as borrow it, but most of the top results in google reference [[books/among others|her use of it]], or at least the SFF community. \n\n\u003e _“Bibliotropic,” Hugh said. “Like sunflowers are heliotropic, they naturally turn towards the sun.

Far enemies are the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. For example, a near enemy of loving-kindness is sentimentality—similar but different. A far enemy of loving-kindness is ill will—the opposite of loving-kindness. Similarly, a near enemy of compassion is pity and a far enemy is cruelty.”\n\n\u003e The near enemies depict how spirituality can be misunderstood or misused to separate us from life. (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e I define spirituality as the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to each other by something greater than ourselves. I have friends who are atheists who every day practice inextricable connection—they hurt when others hurt and they know that none of us are free until all of us are free. I have friends who talk endlessly about their religion and wear scripture on their T-shirts, yet demonstrate no connection to anyone’s suffering but their own and maybe that of the people in their immediate circle. I make this point because we’re not talking about religion here. We’re talking about the irrepressible human spirit.\n\n\u003e On the surface, the near enemies of emotions or experiences might look and even feel like connection, but ultimately they drive us to be disconnected from ourselves and from each other. Without awareness, near enemies become the practices that fuel separation, rather than practices that reinforce the inextricable connection of all people.\n\n\u003e “The near enemy of love is attachment. Attachment masquerades as love. It says, “I will love this person (because I need something from them).” Or, “I’ll love you if you’ll love me back. I’ll love you, but only if you will be the way I want.” This isn’t the fullness of love. Instead there is attachment—there is clinging and fear. True love allows, honors, and appreciates; attachment grasps, demands, needs, and aims to possess.” (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e Near enemies can feel like manipulation and even gaslighting.

Given their sheer emotional intensity, it’s easy to mistake feelings of symbolic disgust for an immovable moral reality that exists outside our own subjective heads. But they don’t.\n\nWe don’t have to “learn” how to get diarrhea or vomit, or revolt at pus-filled sores. But we do have to learn the symbolic disgust, what to hate, shun, or shame, and that is culturally relative. \n\nBering’s essay that is basically an excerpt from his book *[[books/perv|Perv]]*: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/disgust-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/\n\n---\n\nLook, I’m gonna side eye any opinion on menstruation authored by a man, but the essay [Is PMS Real?](https://slate.com/technology/2016/11/pms-might-be-a-cultural-syndrome-not-a-biologic-one.html) by Frank Bures offers a fascinating glimpse at culture-bound syndromes:\n\n\u003e The phenomenon of so-called culture-bound syndromes, which more recently have come to be known as “cultural syndromes,” or sometimes, “cultural idioms of distress.” It was a path I started down when I traveled to Nigeria to investigate magical penis theft, in which a person believes his (or sometimes her) genitals to have been stolen via magic. This is known in the medical literatures as koro, or “genital retraction syndrome,” and versions of it have been recorded, among other places, in China, Thailand, and India.\n\u003e \n\u003e Trying to understand koro, in turn, lead me into a labyrinth of other syndromes, many of which seem unreal to Westerners, though not to those experiencing them. People have “wind attacks” in Cambodia, where the flow of wind through the body reverses or is blocked, causing dizziness, shortness of breath, numbness, and fever. In China some people suffer from “frigophobia,” or the “morbid fear of cold… and the need to wear excessive clothing.” In parts of India you can contract “gilhari syndrome” in which patients arrive at the hospital with swelling on the back of their necks, complaining that a gilhari (a kind of lizard) crawled under their skin and terrified that they will die if the creature reaches their neck.\n\u003e \n\u003e Eventually this path led me back to my own culture, and to our own syndromes that don’t occur in other cultures. Premenstrual syndrome was near the top of this list.\n\nCiting other studies, he notes: \n\n\u003e The subtext of these critiques is that PMS is “socially constructed,” meaning it’s an imaginary condition foisted on women by society, which is another way of saying PMS is “not real.” Yet ==just because something is a social construction does not mean we don’t experience it==—it simply means that our “real” physiological symptoms can have roots in our mind as well as our body.\n\nIt’s not quite [[notes/moral panics and mass hysteria|mass hysteria]], but regardless of what’s “real” or not, it’s fascinating how susceptible we are to collective persuasion.\n\n(Other fun fact from the article: “On the island of Wogeo, Papua New Guinea, menstruation is traditionally seen as so powerful and cleansing that even men are expected to menstruate. A man does this by walking into the ocean naked, inducing an erection, pushing the foreskin back, then slicing at the glans on either side with the claw of a crab. When the bleeding stops and the ocean water around the man is clear, he returns to shore, wraps his penis in medicinal leaves, and is considered cleansed. The same word is used for male and female menstruation.” !!!)\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.702350951Z","tags":["belief-systems"]},"/notes/debility-and-disability-justice":{"title":"Debility and disability justice","content":"In *[[books/the right to maim|The Right to Maim]]*, [[authors/jasbir puar|Jasbir Puar]] uses the concept of “debility”—bodily injury and social exclusion brought on by economic and political factors—to disrupt the category of disability and the neoliberal concept of disability justice.\n\n\u003e Puar uses the term debilitation to describe what happens to Mohammed and so many others in Gaza that our neoliberal frame of disability rights can’t capture. She explains that debility can’t be understood as an identity like disability, which is usually thought of as an event that happens to an individual, after which they just need accommodations, access, and personal empowerment to be included in society. Rather, debility is what happens when a state makes an entire population available for mass injury — a denial of disability rights altogether.[^1]\n\nThis leads to cognitive dissonance and egregious hypocrisy, where a state perpetuating *genocide* can nonetheless claim themselves a champion of disability justice within that framework of disability rights:\n\n\u003e Israel is, in fact, a signatory on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The IDF proudly claims to be the world’s largest employer of [[notes/autism|autistic people]], and in August, an ambassador told the UN that Israel is committed to eliminating ableism. But this disability rights frame, which for a long time, has been led and theorized by white disabled people who live in the US and Europe, doesn’t map onto the experiences of racialized groups who are targeted en masse by the state.[^2]\n\nIt’s back to that same concept of [[notes/worthy victims|worthy victims]] and [[notes/who is more deserving|who is deserving]].

In response to NPR platforming a woman who sees her disabled husband’s new social limitations as an irritation he is personally inflicting on her, rather than an institutional problem being inflicted on all of us, Julia Doubleday calls out the injustice for what it is. [She writes](https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/disabled-peoples-exclusion-from-indoor):\n\n\u003e This article is not merely an upsetting look at an individual’s victim-blaming mindset about her husband’s indefinite exclusion from public spaces.

(Whyte and Brown, lol.)\n\n((Note: maybe what I classify as despair would be more what Brown describes as anguish??))\n\nPer Whyte, in *[[books/consolations|Consolations]]*, despair is a necessary and [[seasonal time|seasonal state]] of repair, a temporary healing absence, an internal physiological and psychological winter when our previous forms of participation in the world take a rest; it is a loss of horizon, it is the place we go when we do not want to be found in the same way anymore.\n\n\u003e Despair takes us in when we have no place else to go. It is a haven of self-compassion, an invitation, a last protection.\n\nBrown classifies despair as the permanent state of hopelessness, whereas Whyte calls it, “strangely, the last bastion of hope,” which turns to depression and abstraction when we try to make it stay beyond its appointed season. (So still the emphasis on the necessary and *seasonal* state of *repair*.)\n\n\u003e Despair is kept alive by freezing our sense of time and the rhythms of [[notes/concepts of time|time]]; when we no longer feel imprisoned by time, and when the season is allowed to turn, despair cannot survive.\n\nThis feels like it can encompass more of what I classify as despair, which is usually part anguish, part grief, part shutdown, overwhelmed by something I no longer want to be a part of. (The ongoing US-backed genocide in Palestine; the climate crisis; every war across the globe.) \n\nIn *Atlas*, it’s more personal, and doesn’t really include that *necessary* need for hibernation and repair. What Whyte calls a difficult, beautiful necessity, as human beings caught in a fierce and difficult world where half of our experience is mediated by loss.\n\nAnd how to emerge, when nothing is in one’s control to fix? By giving the despair a profound and courageous attention. \n\n\u003e To see and experience despair fully in our body is to begin to see it as a necessary, seasonal visitation, and the first step in letting it have its own life, neither holding it nor moving it on before its time.\n\nBasically, you could say it is a waveform, not a prison: \n\n\u003e We take the first steps out of despair by taking on its full weight and coming fully to ground in our wish not to be here. We let our bodies and we let our world breathe again. In that place, strangely, despair cannot do anything but change into something else, into some other season, as it was meant to do, from the beginning.\n\nThat makes me think of [[ecclesiastes|Ecclesiastes]], *to everything a season*.

It’s about the author’s desire for readers who can join the dots, follow implications and allusions through to their natural conclusions, who can “image” for themselves, “paint” for themselves, who don’t necessarily have to see the words set down in order to understand the message.\n\nReading between the lines, connecting the dots. Austen already asks that much of her readers with the narrative voice she refined—nay, invented. There’s a constant, clever irony between what is said and what should be understood, a discrepancy that allows the reader to discover for themselves who her characters really are, and how that differs from how they’re seen by others or how they see themselves. In her correspondence with Richard Crosby, the publisher who shelved her first novel for years, she gives herself the name “Mrs. Ashton Dennis” so she can sign the letter with the acrostic “MAD.”\n\nIt’s not a stretch to think she wrote other thoughts in clear view, wanting only for readers with the ingenuity to see it.

In this way, the laws of chemistry can be said to be emergent from physics: the laws of chemistry presuppose the laws of physics, but can’t simply be reduced to them. In the same way, the laws of biology emerge from chemistry: one obviously needs to understand the chemical components of a fish to understand how it swims, but chemical components will never provide a full explanation.

They energize us for fight-and-flight and live in our limbic system. \n\n**Routine emotions** such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and anger nourish our lives, lasting for a while then fading. Humans, on average 30 or more different emotional states every day. These emotions don’t require thought—they occur as a matter of course, and originate in the sensory part of the brain. (Note: it is likely the routine emotions that are hardest for people with alexithymia to access.)\n\n**Reflective emotions** such as anger, grief, and jealousy occur primarily in our prefrontal cortex and require conscious thought. \n\nReactive emotions are some of the hardest ones to cool off. These are happening in the limbic and survival portions of the brain, and our prefrontal cortex is what houses our executive functioning and observing self. When this part of our brain is online, we’re more easily able to calm ourselves down. But that is the precise part of the brain that tends to go offline during emotionally intense moments. Some studies have shown that ADHDers and Autistic people have reduced connectivity between the more emotional centers of our brains and our prefrontal cortex, and must work harder to bring the prefrontal cortex back online during emotionally hot moments.\n\nWhen we can take two seconds to pause and identify the emotion, we are bringing observing and reflective self to the forefront, which helps to bring our prefrontal cortex back online. This helps calm the whole system down.  When we label our emotions, we recruit our prefrontal cortex to come help down-regulate the limbic system and so-called “reptilian brain.” \n\nThis is likely one reason we see increased rates of anxiety among people with alexithymia. Because they cannot label their emotions, they aren’t as easily able to recruit their prefrontal cortex to help out and self-soothe when their fear system gets activated. So for people who struggle with emotional regulation or alexithymia, emotional labeling can be particularly helpful in developing effective self-soothing and coping strategies.\n\nSource: [Neurodivergent Insights - Emotional Identification](https://neurodivergentinsights.com/blog/emotional-identification)","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.702350951Z","tags":["therapy","autism","emotional-intelligence"]},"/notes/endurance":{"title":"The Chinese word for endurance","content":"In *[[books/what my bones know|What My Bones Know]]*, [[authors/stephanie foo|Stephanie Foo]] says:\n\n\u003e It made perfect sense to me later in life when I discovered that the Chinese word for endurance is simply the word _knife_ on top of the word _heart_.

Queen Elizabeth proclaimed a set of laws designed to maintain order and contribute to the general good of the kingdom: **the English Poor Laws**.  These laws remained in force for more than 250 years with only minor changes. Essentially, the laws distinguished ==three major categories of dependents: the vagrant, the involuntary unemployed, and the helpless==. The laws also set forth ways and means for dealing with each category of dependents. Most important, the laws established the parish (i.e.,local government), acting through an overseer of the poor appointed by local officials, as the administrative unit for executing the law.\n\u003e\n\u003e The poor laws gave the local government the power to raise taxes as needed and use the funds to build and maintain almshouses; to provide indoor relief (i.e., cash or sustenance) for the aged, handicapped and other ==worthy poor==; and the tools and materials required to put the unemployed to work. Parents were required to support their children and grandchildren. ==Likewise, children were responsible for the care of their unemployable parents and grandparents.== Children whose parents could not support them were forced into mandatory apprenticeships. ==They had no right to object== to the compensation or the interference with their own child-rearing activities. Vagrants and ==any able bodied persons who refused to work== could be committed to a house of correction or fined.\n\u003e\n\u003e In response to concerns that dependent persons would move to parishes where financial assistance was more generous, ==in 1662 a severe **Law of Settlement and Removal** was enacted in England==. The law made it possible for local authorities to force individuals and families to leave a town and return to their home parish if they became dependent. In effect, this law allowed a local government to restrict aid only to persons and families known to be “residents.”\n\u003e\n\u003e==The American colonies and state governments== modeled their public assistance for the poor on the **Elizabethan Poor Laws and the Law of Settlement and Removal**.\n\nNote the sorting into categories, the “worthy poor,” the children with no right to object, the laws of increasing severity in order to close the loopholes.

By contrast, the female sheep and goats that were able to “go both ways” after their intensive cross-rearing experiences, equally aroused by both their own biological kind and members of their adoptive species, were exhibiting “erotic plasticity” (in which one can be sexually excited by a wide range of stimuli). Interestingly enough, erotic plasticity is also strikingly more apparent in human females than it is in human males. Another way to say this is that a girl’s developing sexuality is more fluid or labile (and for once that’s not a pun) than a boy’s; it’s less prone to getting locked onto a specific category of erotic target during childhood.\n\u003e \n\u003e In fact, women in general are far more likely than men to report being bisexual. Tellingly, they’re also more likely to change their self-identification as straight or gay during their adult lives. Furthermore, lesbians are more likely than gay men to say that their sexual orientation is a “choice,” a term that really only makes sense, of course, if the individual is in fact bisexual and decides to commit to one label or another.

Homer wrote historyfic and Virgil wrote Homerfic and Dante wrote Virgilfic (_where he makes himself a character and writes himself hanging out with Homer and Virgil_ and they’re like “_OMG Dante you’re so cool._” He was the original [Gary Stu](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mary_Sue)). Milton wrote Bible fanfic, and everyone and their mom spent the Middle Ages writing \u003ca href=\"/shelves/arthurian/\" class=\"internal-link\"\u003eKing Arthur fanfic\u003c/a\u003e. In the sixteenth century you and another dude could translate the same Petrarchan sonnet and somehow have it count as two separate poems, and no one gave a fuck. Shakespeare _doesn’t have a single original plot_—although much of it would be more rightly termed RPF—and then John Fletcher and Mary Cowden Clarke and Gloria Naylor and Jane Smiley and Stephen Sondheim wrote Shakespeare fanfic. Guys like Pope and Dryden took old narratives and rewrote them to make fun of people they didn’t like, because the eighteenth century was basically high school. And Spenser! Don’t even get me started on Spenser.\n\u003e \n\u003e Here’s what fanfic authors/fans need to remember when anyone gives them shit: _the idea that originality is somehow a good thing, an innately preferable thing, [[notes/the culturally bound notion of authorship|is a completely modern notion]]._ Until about three hundred years ago, a good writer, by and large, was someone who could take a tried-and-true story and make it even more awesome. (If you want to sound fancy, the technical term is _imitatio_.) People were like, _why would I wanna read something about some dude I’ve never heard of? There’s a new Sir Gawain story out, man!_ (As to when and how that changed, I tend to blame Daniel Defoe, or the Modernists, or reality television, depending on my mood.)\n\u003e \n\u003e I also find fanfic fascinating because it takes all the barriers that keep people from professional authorship—barriers that have weakened over the centuries but are nevertheless still very real—and blows right past them. Producing literature, much less circulating it, was something that was well nigh impossible for the vast majority of people for most of human history. First you had to live in a culture where people thought it was acceptable for you to even want to be literate in the first place. And then you had to find someone who could teach you how to read _and_ write (the two didn’t necessarily go together). And you needed sufficient leisure time to learn. And be able to afford books, or at least be friends with someone rich enough to own books who would lend them to you. Good writers are usually well-read and professional writing is a full-time job, so you needed a lot of books, and a lot of leisure time both for reading and writing. And then you had to be in a high enough social position that someone would take you seriously and want to read your work—to have access to circulation/publication in addition to education and leisure time. \n\u003e \n\u003e A very tiny percentage of the population fit those parameters (in England, which is the only place I can speak of with some authority, that meant from 500–1000 A.D.: monks; 1000–1500: aristocratic men and the very occasional aristocratic woman; 1500–1800: aristocratic men, some middle-class men, a few aristocratic women; 1800–on, some middle-class women as well). \n\u003e \n\u003e What’s amazing is how many people who didn’t fit those parameters kept writing in spite of the constant message they got from society that no one cared about what they had to say, writing letters and diaries and stories and poems that often weren’t discovered until hundreds of years later. Humans have an urge to express themselves, to tell stories, and fanfic lets them. If you’ve got access to a computer and an hour or two to while away of an evening, you can create something that people will see and respond to instantly, with a built-in community of people who care about what you have to say. \n\u003e \n\u003e I do write the occasional fic; I wish I had the time and mental energy to write more. I’ll admit I don’t read a lot of fic these days because most of it is not—and I _know_ how snobbish this sounds—particularly well-written. That doesn’t mean it’s “not good”—there are a lot of reasons people read fic and not all of them have to do with wanting to read finely crafted prose. That’s why fic is awesome—it creates a place for all kinds of storytelling. But for me personally, now that my job entails reading about 1500 pages of undergraduate writing per year, when I have time to read for enjoyment I want it to be by someone who really knows what they’re doing. There’s tons of high-quality fic, of course, but I no longer have the time and patience to go searching for it that I had ten years ago. But whether I’m reading it or not, I love that fanfiction exists. Because without people doing what fanfiction writers do, _literature_ wouldn’t exist. (And then I’d be out of a job and, frankly, I don’t know how to do anything else.)\n\nI sourced the post [here](https://allanamayer.tumblr.com/post/73223957387/i-think-fanfiction-is-literature-and-literature), as the original post, [“As a professor, may I ask you what you think about fanfiction?”](http://onlyalittlelion.tumblr.com/post/29097051054/tywinning-asked-you-2012-08-09-03-37-as-a) is already lost to the ether.

Unintentional abuse can cause as much harm as intentional abuse, and can be even harder to recognize and put a stop to, because when we look at the person causing it we don’t see the kind of villain we think of as an abuser. People get caught in unhealthy relationship dynamics all the time, and without the tools to recognize it and the power to change it, abuse can go unchecked for years. \n\nThe most difficult kind of abuse to recognize is psychological and emotional, not necessarily physical. If you don’t trust yourself and your feelings when something feels off, you might convince yourself that nothing is wrong, that it’s all in your head, or that the problem is you. \n\nThe problem is rarely “just you.” This can be a powerful signal that your body is trying to send you, and you owe it to yourself to listen. \n\n\u003e ==Abuse is best recognized by the effect it has on the abused.== \n\n## The relationship checklist\n\nHere are some questions to ask yourself when you’re involved in any type of relationship: \n\n(this can include power exchange relationships, love affairs, marriages, friendships, or interactions with any authority figures, like a boss, parent, or spiritual guide)\n\n* Are they interested in your needs, limits, and desires, and do they prioritize meeting your needs, respecting your limits, and supporting your desires?\n* Do they tell you how you ought to think and feel, and try to force you into that mold? \n* Do you feel fundamentally safe? \n* Can you have a direct conversation, and tell them what you really think and how you really feel? Do they listen?\n* Do they express their emotions in a healthy way? Do they allow you to express yours in a healthy way?\n* Do they take responsibility for themselves? Do they place blame on you when something goes wrong?\n* Do you feel any fear, tension, or a heavy, dreadful feeling that you wish you could avoid?\n* Do you feel fulfilled and happy around them?\n* Do they have your best interests at heart, or do they repeatedly put their own interests above yours?\n* Do they encourage you to get other perspectives and seek other sources of support? To read books, make friends, participate in the community, etc? Or do they try to cut you off and make you dependent only on them?\n* Are you confident it would be safe for you to change your boundaries in the relationship, or to end it if you wanted? Would they take it well and respect your decision?\n* Does it *feel good*? Every relationship has its challenges and stresses, and can mean not getting your way about a lot of things. But it should always be something you *want* to be doing. Not just something that you endure for the sake of love or approval, or that you accept because you are afraid of the consequences, or because it’s what you’ve been told you should do.\n\nIf you are at all uncomfortable with your own answers to these questions, then something about your relationship is off and needs to change. If it can’t be changed, perhaps it needs to end.","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.702350951Z","tags":["therapy"]},"/notes/humanitas-humus":{"title":"Humanitas/humus","content":"\n\u003e *Humanitas* in Latin comes first and properly from *humando*, meaning ‘burying, burial’, itself from *humus*, meaning ‘earth’ or ‘soil.’ In burial, the human body becomes a component of the earth, returned as dust to dust—*inhumed*, restored to humility, rendered humble. \n\n*[[books/underland|Underland]]*, [[authors/robert macfarlane|Robert Macfarlane]]","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.702350951Z","tags":["lexicon"]},"/notes/institutional-betrayal":{"title":"Institutional betrayal","content":"Institutional betrayal is when an institution causes harm (by action *or* inaction) to anyone who trusts or depends on them.

And the American settlers of the time considered Indians and Hispanics to be inferior and therefore deserving of cultivation. The settlers considered the United States to be the best possible way to organize a country so they felt the need ==to remake the world in the image of their own country==.\n\nMany Americans believed that ==God blessed the growth of American nation== and even demanded of them to actively work on it. Since they were sure of ==their cultural and racial superiority==, they felt that their destiny was to spread their rule around and enlighten the nations that were not so lucky. The settlers firmly believed in ==the virtue of American people and the mission to impose their virtuous – mainly Puritan – way of life on everybody else==. This rhetorical background served to explain the acquisition of territories or reasons to go to war, such as the war with Mexico in 1840s.\n\nOutside the United States, the effects of manifest destiny were seen in U.S. intervention in the Spanish-American war when Spain ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico and Guam to the U.S. This was an expansion of U.S. territory as colonies rather than states and was ==another demonstration of growing U.S. imperialism==.\n\nThe term of ‘Manifest Destiny’ first appeared in a newspaper article on the annexation of Texas in edition from July/August of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review in 1845.

Yet these more impolite details about the sex lives of other species haven’t led to many moral arguments (or at least persuasive ones) for human adults having sex with children or men raping women. And they shouldn’t. But we need to be careful here, because in cherry-picking features of the natural world to defend one social category—in this case, gays and lesbians—we risk shaking the whole tree.\n\nIt’s a great rhetorical device, and it’s flawed logic. We can do better, especially when it comes to sexual ethics.\n\n\u003e Same-sex behaviors in other species are interesting in their own right. But are we humans really that lost in the ethical wilderness that we’re actually seeking guidance from monkeys, crawfish, and penguins about the acceptable use of our genitals? We engage in the same questionable reasoning when citing other nonmonogamous species to support our views on polyamorous (or “open”) relationships (this was in fact a message central to the popular book *[[books/sex at dawn|Sex at Dawn]]* by [[authors/christopher ryan|Christopher Ryan]] and [[authors/cacilda jetha|Cacilda Jethá]]).\n\nBesides, he adds:\n\n\u003e Even if we were indeed the lone queer species in an infinite universe of potentially habitable planets, it’s unclear to me how that would make marriage between two gay adults in love with each other less okay.\n\nInterestingly, the better option seems to be *is it harmful?* instead of *is it natural?* Not because the concept is any less fallible, but because *we’re more aware* that it is. It’s a much more challenging question. Knowing something is subjective instead of empirical helps us tread more thoughtfully. At least in theory—first we have to wrestle the concept of harm away from abstract concepts and symbolic appeals to emotion: \n\n\u003e For social conservatives, the damage might even be seen as inflicted on symbolic bodies—“America,” for example, “the Church,” “society,” or “the sanctity of marriage.” ==Saying that a behavior is “harmful to America” or that it’s “destructive to society” is a bit like giving corporations the legal status of personhood. That is, it only makes sense to those with an agenda.== The scientific definition of a “person” as a carbon-based life-form resembles nothing of the circuitous legal definition that enables a profit-driven corporation to claim that same status. Likewise, pain and distress can occur only at the level of a subjectively experiencing organism (human or animal) in possession of pain receptors and a nervous system able to register emotional trauma, not at the level of an abstract entity without a brain. ==The problem of sexual harm concerns living, breathing creatures, not political parties, nations, or worldviews.==\n\nAnd in an ideal world, we’d be more aware too of [[notes/culture-bound syndrome|symbolic disgust]] and [[notes/moral dumbfounding|moral dumbfounding]].\n\n---\n\nMost succinctly: \n\n\u003e Humans can justify almost anything by calling it natural.\n\u003e Naturalness is the pervasive myth—the one to root out of your head.\n\n([[authors/verlyn klinkenborg|Verlyn Klinkenborg]], *[[books/several short sentences about writing|Several Short Sentences About Writing]]*)","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.706351007Z","tags":["philosophy"]},"/notes/on-firearms-trust-and-historical-accuracy":{"title":"On firearms, trust and historical accuracy","content":"There’s a scene in *[[books/a governess’s guide to passion and peril|A Governess's Guide to Passion and Peril]]* that has stuck in my mind, and I want to write through it to figure out why it’s niggling at me. (Spoilers abound, beware.)\n\nSet-up: near the end of the book, Jane and Adrian, among others, are confronting Payne, the murderer, who is about to murder another of their party by making him appear to commit suicide (forced at gunpoint to jump out a window). This victim is allowed to hug his wife goodbye, and in a last ditch effort to save his life, Adrian also embraces Jane as a distraction, to pass her a pistol he has in his coat pocket. He does that thing I hate—“shoot when I give the signal” without saying what signal! I swear, if this happened to me, he’d be dead and I’d be standing there going, “but what was the signal!”\n\nBut I digress. That’s not the problem. Adrian does give a signal, Jane interprets it correctly, and shoots the villain. She’s the hero, she saves the day. Payne is not fatally wounded (she shoots him in the chest, but the injury is “not serious,” a Hollywood pet peeve of mine), they get a confession, and everyone lives happily ever after. It’s played as Jane being a badass, and that she can do anything a man can do, and look how much Adrian trusted her, awww, squooshy feelings. \n\nThis is where I have the problem. And I’m going to set aside gender, because I’d have the same problem if these characters were two men or two women. \n\n1. Nowhere in the book has it been established that Jane knows how to use a gun. She’s a young, newly-impoverished daughter of a diplomat and has been working as a governess. Many women of this era were markswomen; many were not. Maybe I’m pining for [[books/proper english|Pat and Fen]] here, but establishing her background with firearms (or lack thereof) during the locked-door house party would be a) great character work, b) groundwork for the later scene, and c) fun and flirty times. But we get none of that. \n\n2. The pistol gets the Hollywood treatment—it’s apparently loaded, primed, and cocked, so all Jane has to do is point and pull the trigger. But this is 1869. In the Victorian era, pistols are notoriously fiddly, even unwieldy. To make matters worse, it’s a pistol Adrian got from a butler moments before this scene; it’s not even his own. He doesn’t load it himself, nor does he check to see if it’s been loaded correctly. Maybe I’m pining for [[books/think of england|Archie Curtis]] here, but the risk of misfires and injury is not insignificant. Or just the flat-out inability to pull the hammer, much less the trigger. \n\n3. Let’s leave aside the magic aim, where Jane hits her target on the first shot despite the weight of the pistol, the recoil, etc. It happens. Either luck or accident, but it happens. It’s hailed immediately as a triumph, end of story, and we cut straight to a bedroom scene and then an epilogue where Jane and Adrian are picnicking and boating, kissing in a pond, living happily ever after. And maybe I’m pining for [[books/something fabulous|Arabella Tarleton]] here (are you sensing a theme?), but just up and shooting a man is no small thing. Earlier, Jane has gone pale and panicked, nearly fainted, over much smaller stressors. Finding the dead body that kicks off the action disturbs her off and on throughout the book. There’s no mental or emotional fallout from nearly killing a man herself, even if he has killed her father? If anything, that would make it more fraught, in my opinion. \n\nSo what looks like this moment of empowerment for Jane backfires, so to speak. Instead of Adrian trusting her with his life, it looks more like Adrian being reckless at best, intentionally endangering her at worst. Nowhere in the staging of the scene is it indicated that this course of action is their only option. Yes, if you’re determined to have a shootout, it’s more obvious to have her provide the distraction while he shoots, especially since it’s established the villain has been fond of her since she was a child. Yes, I understand wanting to subvert those expectations, especially the gender-based ones.[^1] But there has to be some groundwork in place to make that role-switch ring true. \n\nOtherwise, it looks like Adrian selfishly putting her in harm’s way—injury, misfire, the psychological weight of killing a man, possibly even killing Adrian himself or their other friends in the room. The text is frustratingly sloppy: Payne interchangeably aims a rifle, then a pistol. Continuity error? Or he has both? One in each hand? It’s not clear! The scene is not blocked out at all, much less well. They’re in an attic; how tight is the space, where are the others in the line of fire? Adrian lunges to draw Payne’s aim away right before Jane fires. Even the most experienced marksman could fail to hit a moving target under pressure—or hit the wrong one. If the ploy is successful, which it is, it still looks like he doesn’t think, much less care about the effect this would have on her. And instead of developing her character, this sudden temerity comes out of nowhere, negating what we’ve learned of Jane so far. \n\nWhat’s more—Adrian is still calling all the shots, so to speak. It’s his (borrowed) gun, his plan, he tells her what to do and she does it. If flipping the script is the goal, we could have her say no, that’s absurd, \\*insert better plan here.\\* Empowerment and cleverness and a real chance for mutual trust, all at once. \n\nI’ve already summoned [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] and [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]] to the chat, but that’s the level of attention in the writing that would make such a scene pay off. In *[[books/proper english|Proper English]]*, Pat is a sharpshooter and the romance develops as she teaches Fen how to shoot, in anticipation of having her defend herself. In *[[books/think of england|Think of England]]*, Archie, *a career soldier*, loses three fingers due to a misfiring firearm. In [[series/will darling adventures|The Will Darling Adventures]], set post-WWI, firearms are still tricky bastards—clips need to be loaded, or shots are missed, even by experienced spies, soldiers or henchmen. Phoebe and Maisie repeatedly look stronger and wiser for finding better ways to save the day. In *[[books/something fabulous|Something Fabulous]]*, the most absurd froth of tropes and anachronisms there is, *nobody* can pull off a successful dual because *nobody* has proper experience with firearms (save for Peggy), and when Arabella does shoot Valentine—the one shoulder injury that doesn’t peeve me because it’s handled so accurately—the various consequences of that play out for *three books*. \n\nBy contrast, I’m rattled for Jane, and don’t want to see her wellbeing entrusted to Adrian, much less carelessly ride off into the sunset. Who is going to look after her needs? I’m with Payne; he’s an idiot. She deserves better!\n\n*You’re overthinking it, Jamie.* Yes, I know. I understand wanting the romantic Hollywood gloss, but too much of a gloss and it leaves me cold, and the HEA feels remarkably hollow. Sharper writing, more thorough character development, and attention to historical detail could have made that ending a much more satisfying one. \n\n[^1]: Maybe I’m just salty, but if you want to subvert gender-based expectations, start with the part where Jane coddles Adrian’s emotions, putting his comfort above her own. And it’s tough, because there’s a fine line between that and genuine care and support, both wonderful things. The automatic expectation of emotional labor just because she’s the female half of the equation is what rubs me the wrong way, especially when the expectations are one-sided.\n","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.706351007Z","tags":["writing-practice","close-reading"]},"/notes/phatic-phrases":{"title":"Phatic phrases","content":"Phatic phrases are the phrases that follow a well-worn script, and as long as you don’t miss the beat, the words themselves don’t matter. \n\nFor example:\nHi!\nWhat’s up?\nFine, how are you?\nNot much. \n\nEach person is responding to questions that weren’t asked, but the script is so familiar and the beats so ingrained that nobody notices. \n\nMost greetings and sign-offs are phatic phrases.

(NOPE.)\n\nBe the change you want to see in the world, etc. etc. Here we go.\n\n## The basics\n\nAll race numbers are grouped by teams. At any given race, the #1 bib (*dossard*, if you’re feeling French) goes to the defending champion, or to the new team leader of the winning team, if the defending champion is not on the startlist. Their teammates receive bibs #2–#8 in ascending alphabetical order. \n\nFor the remaining teams, the first 1-2 digits is the team number, and the last digit is the rider number. The team leader of the next team is #11, with their teammates #12–#18. Then #21, with teammates #22–#28, followed by #31, and so forth.\n\nThe team order is assigned either alphabetically—the Giro d’Italia, among others—or by [World Tour ranking](https://www.procyclingstats.com/rankings/me/uci-teams)—the Vuelta a España, among others. The Tour de France assigns the second and third slots to the previous year’s runners-up, and then the rest of the teams typically follow based on WT rank.\n\n![[images/dossard.jpg]]\n\n## What this means\n\nOnce you know what to look for, there is a logic to the madness, and it makes it fairly easy to tell at a glance who’s who within any given race. \n\nMany races will group their [World Tour and Pro teams](https://www.procyclingstats.com/teams/worldtour) alphabetically, then group the [continental or national (wildcard) teams](https://www.procyclingstats.com/teams/continental) below them. Races sorted by ranking will typically have the continental or national teams near the bottom also, as those teams have smaller budgets, qualify for fewer races, and have fewer riders who can win at the World Tour level.\n\nHigher team numbers don’t *necessarily* indicate a lower ranked team, depending on the classification of the race and the number of teams participating. In the 2024 season, for example, an alphabetical startlist could place UAE or Visma in the 16th or 17th slot, despite being the two highest ranked teams in the World Tour. But as a *general* rule, the higher the number, the lower the team is ranked. The 18th slot onwards are typically the wildcards, i.e. continental and national teams, in first category races.\n\n## What the category?\n\nJust when you thought it couldn’t get more complicated! Each race on the calendar is [classified on a scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications) depending on the type of race and the prestige or difficulty of the parcours. This effects which teams participate and the quality of the startlist, which in turn effects what information the bib numbers offer at a glance. \n\nAt a first category race, all [18 World Tour teams](https://www.procyclingstats.com/teams/worldtour) are required to be present, and pro teams need a wildcard invitation to participate (2–4 wildcards per race). A pro-level race will have fewer World Tour teams, so more Pro, continental, and national teams are present. At a second category race, only a few World Tour teams may participate, and the majority of the startlist is continental, national, and development teams.\n\nKnowing the category of the race lets you tell (roughly) how many World Tour teams there are, and thus at which point the team numbers starting indicating lower-level teams.\n\n## Crunching the numbers!\n\nHere’s a real world example, comparing a first category stage race with a second category stage race, the Tour de Suisse vs. the Tour of Austria. \n\n### First category race \n\nThe Tour de Suisse is classified 2.UWT: the 2 indicates it’s race with multiple stages, and UWT = UCI World Tour, which means all WT teams have mandatory participation. Due to its place on the calendar, early June, it’s also used as a prep race for the Tour de France in July. This attracts a high-quality startlist. \n\nLet’s look at [the 2024 edition](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-suisse/2024/startlist). Mattias Skjelmose from Lidl-Trek (formerly Trek-Segafredo) won in 2023, so he and his team get top slot. From there it’s the World Tour teams (WT) in alphabetical order, followed by the Pro teams (PRT) in alphabetical order, followed by the lone Swiss Cycling national team (NAT), which gets an invitation to participate in their home race. \n\nNote that Team Visma and UAE are down there in the 16th and 17th slots, despite, as I said before, being the two highest ranked teams in 2024. That’s their luck of the alphabetical draw in a startlist of this quality, since neither of them won the previous edition. However, any team in the 18th slot and below indicates their lower ranking.\n\nSo in a first category race like Tour de Suisse, glancing at a dossard with #224 tells me it’s a domestique or stage hunter of a continental team, with a very long shot at reaching a podium. By contrast, a race number of #171 (Adam Yates, UAE Team Emirates), #101 (Egan Bernal, Ineos Grenadiers), or #1 (Skjelmose, Lidl-Trek) tells me they’re top contenders for the podium. And indeed, [Yates won two stages and the overall GC](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-suisse/2024), with the others finishing within the top 5.\n\n### Second category race\n\nNow, let’s compare with the [2024 Tour of Austria startlist](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-of-austria/2024/startlist). It’s a second category stage race (2.1), so there is no mandatory participation for WT teams. It’s grouped in the same order as Tour de Suisse, which is handy for comparison purposes—World Tour teams (WT) in alphabetical order, followed by the pro continental teams (PRT) and then continental teams (CT) in alphabetical order. \n\nCrunching these numbers gives us a much different story. The race takes place in July, which puts it in direct competition with the Tour de France, the most prestigious race on the calendar. Only four WT teams and two Pro teams are present, and without their star riders. The bulk of the startlist is all continental or development teams. \n\nDiego Ulissi, the eventual winner, has bib #37—his team, UAE, alphabetically gets the fourth slot out of the four WT teams. (Remember, the 4th team = #3 on the bib, since the first team gets single digits, and effectively no “team number.”) Felix Großschartner is the UAE team leader (#31), by virtue of his being a solid (second-tier) GC rider, but also by virtue of his being Austrian (see [[#Who’s 1?|Who’s #1?]] below). His teammate Ulissi is the better climber though, and comes away with the win on stage 3 and the lead of the race. As expected, the top five finishers are all WT teams, and their race numbers reflect that—Rivera (#5) and Sheffield (#6) from Ineos, the aforementioned Großschartner (#31), and Xandro Meurisse (lucky number #13, [[#Exceptions to the rules|more on that below too]]) from Alpecin-Deceuninck. Two continental teams crack the top 10—Márton Dina (#122) in 9th place, and Ric Zoidl (#81) in 10th—which reflects the (lack of) quality in the startlist.\n\nSo the race numbers still tell us a lot, once adjusted for the race classification. It’s why I can pick up a cycling romance (\\*cough,\\* *[[books/spokes|Spokes]]*) and balk when the star rider is #141 at a 2.1 race. The author is trying to tell me he’s one of the best cyclists in the world—the numbers are telling me he’s racing on a continental team at an unprestigious race.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s another reason why you don’t often see the big names competing in second category races. Continental or development teams are working their way up through the ranks, their riders are often less skilled, the route is less optimal for racing, and the organizers lack the budget to provide full safety measures. Crashes are nearly 100% guaranteed, and the risk of race-ending or season-ending injuries is arguably higher than usual. Or, tragically, *life*-ending: this year’s final stage of the Tour of Austria was not contested after the fatal crash of André Drege (#171) on stage 4.\n\n## Who’s #1?\n\nWho gets designated the #1 slot on a team depends on the type of team and the race. For one-day classics, the best classics specialist will get top billing. At a stage race, GC teams (those competing for the General Classification) will give their best GC rider the leadership role. For sprint teams, their top sprinter gets the spot. For stage-hunting teams—those who can’t compete in GC or bunch sprints—you’ll often see their highest ranked rider as team leader, or their best rider of the same nationality as either the race or the team.\n\nFor example, back when we were looking at [the Tour of Austria startlist](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-of-austria/2024/startlist), six team leaders were Austrian, including Großschartner (#31) on UAE. As I mentioned, Großschartner doesn’t necessarily outrank Ulissi, but Ulissi is Italian, and thus at an Austrian race, they give the homeboy top billing.\n\nAt World Tour races, this pretty effectively sorts the riders, and often (but not always!) you’ll see lots of #1’s winning bunch sprints or on the final podiums, because the domestiques are doing [their domestique things](https://cycling-passion.com/domestique-explained/).[^1]\n\nAt second category races, it’s more of a mixed bag of hopefuls coupled with national affection, so often (but not always!) you’ll see more non-#1’s coming out on top.\n\n## Exceptions to the rules\n\nHave you noticed how many times I’ve said the word “typically”? Because remember, this is an arcane and endearingly random science, and there are *ALWAYS* exceptions. Let’s Q\u0026A!\n\n**Q: What’s up with #13?**\n**A:** Cyclists (who are not [Sean Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Kelly_(cyclist))) are often superstitious buggers, and the UCI, bless their hearts, are adorable enablers. Any other tampering with race numbers brings a swift fine to the rider and/or team, but the lucky (unlucky?) #13’s are allowed to break the rules and pin their number upside down.\n\nOccasionally, they’re even allowed to dodge the number altogether. In [the 2023 TDF](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2023/startlist/startlist), for example, Großschartner was on domestique duty for team leader Tadej Pogačar, which put him at #13. He chose not to wear the number at all and was assigned #14 instead, bumping the rest of the team down until Adam Yates pinned on #19, the “9th” rider for an 8-man team. Which brings me to…\n\n**Q: Why are some riders out of order?**\n\n**A:** At this point, honestly, who the fuck knows. It can be superstition, as mentioned above. Some riders have multiple surnames, and depending on where they’re racing, that country might order alphabetically based on different names. (IIRC, this happens more often in Spain, or to Spanish riders.) And I believe a last minute replacement can just slot in for the rider they’re replacing… I’ve never gotten confirmation this happens, but it’s appears to now and then.\n\n**Q: Why are some teams out of order?**\n\n**A:** If they look out of order, first off, make sure you’re not looking for an alphabetical listing when they’re ordered by rank, or vice versa. Another common thing is that the official registered name is what gets alphabetically sorted, so yes, Team Visma Lease-a-Bike gets ordered by “T” not “V”, or Bora-Hansgrohe gets bumped down the order when Redbull comes on as title sponsor, and it’s now Redbull-Bora-Hansgrohe.\n\nAlso, the Tour de France will occasionally slot their best French team just after the previous year’s podium; in 2023, #31 was awarded to David Gaudu and FDJ after he finished 4th in the 2022 TDF.\n\n**Q: Why is a superstar on a continental team?**\n\n**A:** It can happen, when a rider is working their way up or down the ranks. For example, Mathieu van der Poel, currently the 4th ranked rider in the world, was on the Corendon-Circus continental team and then the Alpecin-Fenix pro team before they got a World Tour license. He started off as a cyclocross star, and Corendon-Circus is predominantly a cyclocross team. Once he began racing on the road, the team got invited to bigger races due to the star power of MVDP. Same once Alpecin-Fenix (now Alpecin-Deceuninck) formed around him. His status elevated the team and scored frequent invites to prestigious races until the team achieved World Tour status.\n\nA more common occurrence is when a superstar is at the end of their career. They can still bank on their fame, but don’t have the results to match, so they wind up on a lower ranked team before retirement. Think Peter Sagan to Direct Energie or Chris Froome to Israel Premier Tech.\n\n**Q: This top-tier sprinter doesn’t have bib #1, is that an insult?**\n\n**A:** Nah. They’re probably lucky (or unlucky) enough to be on GC team with a huge budget, so the GC leader gets the honor. Think Mark Cavendish riding for Team Sky during their dominant Wiggins-Froome years.\n\n**Q: This top-tier GC contender doesn’t have bib #1, is that an insult?**\n\n**A:** Nah. It can mean there’s dual leadership on the team or that the team has multiple contenders (see the footnote below re: the Roglič/Vingegaard/Kuss extravaganza). GC contenders will also fill a super-domestique role for other GC contenders on the team. For example, if a rider targets the Giro as team leader, he may be super-domestique while another teammate targets the Tour (and gets to be first in line if crashes or illness befall the chosen one). The high-budget superteams attract the top-tier talent, so they’re often stacked deep, with negotiations and politics going on throughout the year to keep the peace. \n\n**Q: Do the race numbers affect the order of the time trials?**\n\n**A:** In absolutely no conceivable way, other than a general trend of indicating the higher ranked teams. \\*Side-eyes [[authors/pd singer|PD Singer]] again\\* \n\nIn a prologue time trial, each team receives *x* number of time slots spaced throughout the day. (Riders from the same team cannot depart back-to-back, as this could allow drafting and shenanigans; also, there are not enough team cars to go around.) Barring bad weather, the best riders (i.e. GC riders or time trial specialists) usually get the final slots. That means lower numbers (better ranked teams and team leaders) are often weighted to the end, and higher numbers (worse ranked teams and domestiques) toward the beginning. It doesn’t makes sense (\\*cough,\\* *[[books/spokes|Spokes]]*) to say an Olympic time trial champion is #199. (flails and facepalms)\n\nOnce a stage race is underway, a mid-race time trial will have the riders depart in reverse order of the general classification, giving the rider(s) in the lead the advantage of racing last. So again, lots of #1’s toward the end, but only because the top-level riders have clustered around the top of the classification by this point.\n\n**Q: My brain hurts. Is there going to be a pop quiz?**\n\n**A:** I would never! Go take a Motrin and lie down in a dark room.\n\n**Q: I’m writing a cycling novel, can I hire you to consult?**\n\n**A:** Absolutely! Call me, babes. 😘\n\n\n[^1]: Hey! A recent and notable exception to this: Sepp Kuss winning the [2023 Vuelta](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/vuelta-a-espana/2023). Kuss pinned on bib #24 as super-domestique for (then) Team Jumbo-Visma. Primož Roglič (#21) was ostensibly their team leader, with Jonas Vingegaard (#28) there to see what he could do, fresh off his Tour de France win. The team “let the road decide” who would come out on top, but before Roglič or Vingegaard could land a blow, a lucky breakaway on stage 6 put Kuss in the leader’s jersey. It’s considered bad form for teammates to attack each other (although Roglič and Vingegaard *really, really, really* wanted to), and so the team happily (according to some sources) or begrudgingly (according to others) rallied around their domestique for the win. This ended in the historic and unlikely result of a single team sweeping the podium, with neither the team leader nor GC favorite on the top step.","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.706351007Z","tags":["cycling","nerdery"]},"/notes/puzzle-book-worldbuilding":{"title":"Puzzle-book worldbuilding","content":"What I call puzzle-book worldbuilding is one of my favorite things to read. It’s maddening, it’s challenging. It’s delightful. It’s a heady rush of satisfaction when the pieces start to click. It’s completely different from worldbuilding that stays dense, illogical, and nonsensical. A lazy author not even bothering to build a puzzle is detectable at first glance from the author you won’t be able to understand until the second read.\n\nIt takes trust. Trust from the author in the reader, and trust from the reader in the author. I won’t trust the author until I can tell they’ve put their trust in me.\n\n[[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]], puzzle-book writer extraordinaire, talks about this in her introduction to *[[books/shadow \u0026 claw|Shadow \u0026 Claw]]*:\n\n\u003e Reading for world-building is a skill. I have seen brilliant people, laureates, inventors, Ph.D.s, try to read fiction with deep world-building and fail completely, looping back, rereading, never following events, trapped in a sense of muddled wandering. Reading for world-building requires retaining information without context: a term, a place, a coin, a category comes up once and we know what that is—a puzzle piece—that our task is to gather up these pieces as the author drops them, and to slowly assemble the whole. This is not easy. Human memory needs hooks for facts: a mnemonic, a story, context, something; grueling textbook rote-learning fades quickly, but a story of the statesman or the king, that’s what makes knowledge stay.\n\nInterestingly, she notes this is a skill kids seem to have naturally: \n\n\u003e To retain puzzle pieces that don’t connect, dropped without context, is a skill that not all have. All had it once: it is how children read, every book, poster, and headline a stream of unknown terms, far too many to ask about them all, but the child retains them, trusting that they will connect to something someday. Kids [[notes/rhizomatic thinking|collect Earth’s puzzle pieces]] every time they read, but as we move to grown-up books they all use the same picture, and define immediately those terms they fear a reader may not know. Thus the skill of keeping puzzle pieces fades, unless we read books set in other worlds, new puzzle pictures which make us retain the skill, as frogs sometimes retain their tadpole tails into adulthood. This—many have observed—is why most F\u0026SF readers come to the genre young, it’s hard to start in adulthood when one’s puzzle-memory skill has sat atrophied.\n\nShe goes on to say that [[authors/gene wolfe|Gene Wolfe]] asks even more, and that like learning to swim before one swims for fun, in many ways one reads the [[series/the book of the new sun|Book of the New Sun]] only on the second pass.\n\nNo wonder my childlike puzzle-loving brain loves this kind of deep worldbuilding. Think [[series/terra ignota|Terra Ignota]], [[series/the locked tomb|The Locked Tomb]], *[[books/china mountain zhang|China Mountain Zhang]]*, or even books like *[[books/among others|Among Others]]* with their own internal logic and language.

Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein. And we didn’t even work hard at it — much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else’s field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\u003e\n\u003eFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn’t have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. ==It wasn’t the meat that made the difference. It was the story.==\n\u003e \n\u003e It is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\u003e \n\u003eThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn’t their story. It’s his.\n\u003e \n\u003e When she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, [[authors/virginia woolf|Virginia Woolf]] wrote a heading in her notebook, “Glossary”; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. ==One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as “botulism.” And _hero_, in Woolf’s dictionary, is “bottle.” The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.==\n\u003e \n\u003e Not just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you haven’t got something to put it in, food will escape you — even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it’s cold and raining and wouldn’t it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn’t it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e *The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.*\n\u003e \n\u003e So says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women’s Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don’t know. I don’t even care. I’m not telling that story. ==We’ve heard it, we’ve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.==\n\u003e \n\u003e And yet old. Before — once you think about it, surely long before — the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger — for what’s the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can’t eat home in — with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\u003e \n\u003e This theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. ==(“What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman’s lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,” Lillian Smith observed.)== The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that’s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\u003e \n\u003e That’s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\u003e \n\u003e Go on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\u003e\n\u003e If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it’s useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again — if to do that is human, if that’s what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.\n\u003e \n\u003e Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don’t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It’s just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.\n\u003e\n\u003e It sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we’d better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one’s finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\u003e \n\u003e It’s unfamiliar, it doesn’t come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, “untold” was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\u003e \n\u003e ==The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story.== Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it.[^1] So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn’t any good if he isn’t in it.\n\u003e\n\u003e I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. ==A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.==\n\u003e \n\u003e One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but ==the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd.== (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, “A story should be seen as a battle,” and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\u003e\n\u003e Finally, it’s clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. ==You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.==\n\u003e\n\u003e That is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\u003e\n\u003e So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse’s skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don’t understand. ==I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn’t say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?==\n\u003e \n\u003e If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. “Technology,” or “modern science” (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the “hard” sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\u003e \n\u003e If, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time’s-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\u003e \n\u003e Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else ==in this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story.== In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool’s joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn’t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\nSource: https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf\n\n[^1]: This makes me think of that bluntly brilliant line in *[[books/always coming home|Always Coming Home]]*: “He thought his hero-soul was in his balls.”","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.706351007Z","tags":["storytelling","creative-practice"]},"/notes/the-culturally-bound-notion-of-authorship":{"title":"The culturally bound notion of authorship","content":"[[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*: \n\n\u003e Our modern, Western notion that authorship should be solo and original is comparatively young and culturally bound, dating back only to after we had the ability to make faithful and exact copies at a mass scale.

This poses an interesting dilemma for a religion that purports to be, indeed, all about love.\n\nUnfortunately, when that dilemma rears its head, we’ve seen the church support colonialism, industrial capitalism, greed, abuse and exploitation over the opposite. \n\nIn *[[books/pantheologies|Pantheologies]]*, [[authors/mary-jane rubenstein|Mary-Jane Rubenstein]] posits that the Protestant Reformation laid the groundwork for our mechanistic science—and vice versa.

This leads to a totalitarian theology, ironically professing to love all while only operating in service of [[notes/who is more deserving|those who are worthy]]. But lest we lay all the blame on the Protestants, Christianity long before then had become rooted in exploitation and violence: \n\n\u003e Hence, it was Christian for the Saxons to submit to “Holy Roman” imperial violence, to be crucified like Christ. The Carolingians constructed a Christian piety that used violence to convert pagans and then taught its victims to regard their violation as justified and sanctified.[^1]\n\nThis is the very same concept was perpetuated via [[notes/manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]. Once the colonies were settled, it became America’s founding myth. They had already inherited this legacy of violence, us vs. them, and either had to renounce their beliefs (so difficult!) or see themselves as superior and entitled to conquer this land. \n\n\u003e Puritan religious piety could not teach the equilibrium and equanimity needed to heal from horror, to relinquish fear, to forgive their enemies or themselves, and to repair harm. They lacked the spiritual disciplines that taught them to observe the world carefully, to trust the senses, and to wonder at the beauty of the land.[^2]\n\nThus the groundwork was laid, and all around us we see a blind, unquestioned belief in those principles. “Just because a myth is old doesn’t mean it’s healthy.”[^3] [[notes/healthy stories are fluid not fixed|What can our new myths be?]]\n\n[^1]: Rebecca Ann Parker and Rita Nakashima Brock, *Saving Paradise*\n[^2]: *ibid*\n[^3]: Sophie Strand, *The Flowering Wand*","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.706351007Z","tags":["belief-systems"]},"/notes/untamed-episode-notes":{"title":"The Untamed episode notes 《陈情令》","content":"\nMy raw notes for *The Untamed*, started when I was trying to make sense of the plot but now an indispensable resource for fic.

Totally fits because as much as I love her as an author ([[books/lent]]! [[books/among others|Among Others]]!), I always say Jo is my favorite reader. \n\nI was trying to find out if [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]] coined vocateur in the [[series/terra ignota|Terra Ignota]] series, and just a cursory google search all give her credit for the term. The only early citation I could find is [a JSTOR article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26281186) from 1983 which, from the preview, seems to be discussing Arno Schmidt’s *Leviathan*. So maybe an obscure term (possibly in translation?) that Ada popularized, at least? \n\nAnyway. Vocateur (“voker” for short) is basically someone intensely devoted to their chosen vocation. I like the connotation with [[amateur]] too, which in French, means “lover.” A “*lover of*,” instead of “*expert at*.” You could say a *vocateur* cultivates that *amateur* love into expertise.\n\nIn the post-scarcity world of Terra Ignota, careers are a thing of the past, no one needs to earn their basic necessities, and one is not permitted to work more than a certain number of hours per week (10 I think?). Vocateurs apply for the permission to work extended hours on their passions. \n\nFrom [an interview with Ada](https://mrissa.livejournal.com/966088.html?): \n\n\u003e I’ve been delighted to have a lot of readers respond enthusiastically to voker/vocateur, and I do think it’s something we see every day but don’t have a good name for, the difference between someone who works and then stops versus someone for whom work is an all-hours passion.  We have “day job” but that implies that it’s somehow not important, not the real you, whereas I have friends who love their jobs and are great at them but are still happy that the job ends when they clock out.  I like how voker/vocateur make clear that both kinds of relationship to one’s work are good and worthy of respect.\n\nAppealing to that passion/love/respect makes the word useful to discuss the opposite too:\n\n\u003e I think the word “vocateur” is an important one to have as a tool for discussing job exploitation, how so many jobs that people are willing to do for love become riddled with exploitative practices (teaching, research, writing, animation, social work...)[^1]\n\n[^1]: [Ada Palmer on Twitter, 12/25/19](https://twitter.com/Ada_Palmer/status/1209982918321414150)","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.706351007Z","tags":["lexicon"]},"/notes/vorfreude":{"title":"Vorfreude","content":"The German word vorfruede has no English equivalent.

Why does the existence of action carried out for the sheer pleasure of acting strike us as mysterious? What does it say about us that we  assume that it is?\n\nWe can’t reduce all living beings to rational, market actors. This tendency has been present since the 19th century beginnings of Darwinian science. Darwin, after all, borrowed the term “survival of the fittest” from the sociologist Herbert Spencer, that darling of robber barons–who was struck by how much the forces driving natural selection jibed with his own laissez-faire economic theories. \n\nCompetition over resources, rational calculation of advantage, and the gradual extinction of the weak were taken to be the prime directives of the universe. But why?\n\nAn alternative school of Darwinism emerged in Russia emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change. cf. [[books/mutual aid|Mutual Aid]] by Pyotr Kropotkin. It’s not just about cooperation as a means to an end though—Kropotkin posits that pleasure and play is an end in itself.\n\n## The origins of consciousness and free will \n\nFriedrich Schiller had already argued in 1795 that it was precisely in play that we find the origins of self-consciousness, and hence freedom, and hence morality.\n\nThis argument gets ignored, since cooperation for pleasure, as an end in itself, is difficult to recuperate for ideological purposes.\n\n## Is emergence enough?\n\n[[notes/emergence|Emergence]] is well and good, but is it enough to explain what’s going on? For example, if an electron is acting freely—if it, as Richard Feynman is supposed to have said, “does anything it likes”—it can only be acting freely as an end in itself. Which would mean that at the very foundations of physical reality, we encounter freedom for its own sake—which also means we encounter the most rudimentary form of play.\n\n## Play is not an anomaly\n\n\u003e What would happen if we proceeded from the reverse perspective and agreed to treat play not as some peculiar anomaly, but as our starting point, a principle already present not just in lobsters and indeed all living creatures, but also on every level where we find what physicists, chemists, and biologists refer to as “self-organizing systems”?\n\nThis gives us ground to unthink the world around us.\n\n## A famous Taoist story\n\nGraeber says when he taught at Yale, he would assign a reading of the following Taoist story, offering an automatic “A” to any student who could tell him why the last line made sense. (None ever succeeded.)\n\n\u003e Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on a bridge over the River Hao, when the former observed, “See how the minnows dart between the rocks! Such is the happiness of fishes.”\n\u003e “You not being a fish,” said Huizi, “how can you possibly know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “And you not being I,” said Zhuangzi, “how can you know that I don’t know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “If I, not being you, cannot know what you know,” replied Huizi, “does it not follow from that very fact that you, not being a fish, cannot know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “Let us go back,” said Zhuangzi, “to your original question. You asked me how I knew what makes fish happy. The very fact you asked shows that you knew I knew—as I did know, from my own feelings on this bridge.”\n\nThe anecdote is usually taken as a confrontation between two irreconcilable approaches to the world: the logician versus the mystic. But if that’s true, then why did Zhuangzi, who wrote it down, show himself to be defeated by his logician friend?\n\n\u003e After thinking about the story for years, it struck me that this was the entire point. By all accounts, Zhuangzi and Huizi were the best of friends. They liked to spend hours arguing like this. Surely, that was what Zhuangzi was really getting at. We can each understand what the other is feeling because, arguing about the fish, ==we are doing exactly what the fish are doing: having fun, doing something we do well for the sheer pleasure of doing it. Engaging in a form of play.== The very fact that you felt compelled to try to beat me in an argument, and were so happy to be able to do so, shows that the premise you were arguing must be false. Since if even philosophers are motivated primarily by such pleasures, by the exercise of their highest powers simply for the sake of doing so, then surely this is a principle that exists on every level of nature—which is why I could spontaneously identify it, too, in fish.\n\n## Stray notes\n\n- Debunks Richard Dawkins and The Selfish Gene, likewise Dennett\n- Jean-Paul Sartre at one point became erotically obsessed with lobsters after taking too much mescaline 🤣\n- Physicists are the poets of the scientific world (more playful and less hidebound creatures than, say, biologists— partly, no doubt, because they rarely have to contend with religious fundamentalists challenging the laws of physics)","lastmodified":"2024-10-02T19:14:38.706351007Z","tags":["pleasure-and-play","working-theories"]},"/notes/who-is-more-deserving":{"title":"Who is more deserving","content":"\n\u003e As if deserving meant anything.
