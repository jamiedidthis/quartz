It’s so clever and so tender, wickedly funny and emotionally cathartic and full of dastardly-gothic-plots-with-a-twist. Everything with [[books/the secret lives of country gentlemen|the first book]] where I was like, I need to read the second book to know how I feel about it—yep. Second book delivered and then some.  \n  \nOnce again it is KJ Charles at her best. And it needs the first book to be so sprawling with its cast, so lavish with its setting, because this one hones right in, a sharp, focused story that _needs_ the sprawling, rich tapestry in the background. A contrast, a balance, that in my opinion is expertly done.  \n  \nFurthermore, I hereby declare: fuck grand gestures for good. I want [Pat/Pran level tears](https://youtu.be/Bqe09a1xL3I?feature=shared\u0026t=723), sob-your-heart-out-and-all-I’m-gonna-do-is-hold-you emotional safety. If your romance can’t support that, is it even really a romance? Give me the intimacy and catharsis; nothing else will do.  \n  \n(It’s not really a spoiler to say KJC delivers exactly that too.)  \n  \nAdditional notes chock full of spoilers:  \n  \n- I am the opposite of upset at all the [[books/band sinister|Viscount Corvin]] treats throughout. Corvin! (Corvin, the “excellent man to be seduced by.” Corvin, his “relentless air of sexual availability.” Haaaahahaha.) Of course that’s who taught Luke what the wider, kinder world looks like. 🥹  \n  \n- Berengaria and Emily happening literally right under their oblivious doofus noses rivals even [[books/sugared game|the magnificent Maisie/Phoebe lack of subtlety/oblivion]] (there’s naked painting! come _on_)  \n  \n- Rufus’s reaction when he catches Luke lying and maybe cheating and stealing is everything to me, as is his eventual excitement at the truth. He’s such a scrupulously honest person, and yet his first thoughtless instincts are to, respectively, lie and bribe on Luke’s behalf, protecting him at all costs even in the midst of despair and betrayal, and then to exuberantly condone a treasure hunt. All of which in the context of things makes him more admirable, _more_ honest. That’s how to make my heart sing.  \n  \n- Once upon a time I said that _Jonathan: or The Struggles of Virtue_ is [[books/wanted a gentleman|the book-within-a-book]] I most wanted to read: its appearance here is the next best thing, in all its kinky gothic glory 🤣  \n  \n- Placing the power balance in Luke’s favor, where the cocky, clever, criminal secretary has arguably (and yes, they do debate it) the upperhand on an earldom—heck yes.  \n  \n- Turning Doomsday and its variations into endearments was honestly one of the things I felt the lack of in the first book. Like, how can you _not_ play with that name? I see why now, and am so glad KJC saved it for this book. Each little iteration of it—_you blasted apocalypse, that pestilent Doomsday, my End of Days_—is so brilliantly felt, so perfect in its context, that I wanna wallow around in it like Odo in the archives (i.e. like a pig in shit). (I’m sorry, Sir Gareth, for judging you for not doing the same.)  \n\n\u003e _“You really are well named, aren’t you?

I then read the whole series (out of order, of course), re-read this one in 2018, again in 2019, and somehow reviewed nary a one before 2020.  \n  \nI feel so sentimental.  \n  \n(And inefficient.)  \n  \nOf course, in 2020, Silas’s politics have taken on a new relevance. I hate to even say that, though—it was relevant three years ago, and 10 years ago, and 200 years ago, and will retain that continuity with both the past and the future. But the events of 1820 have a symmetry with the events of 2020, and while it’s disingenuous to claim that’s anything new, it’s why I found myself wanting—nay, needing?—to read this series again. The comfort of it. The discomfort of it. The agitation and progress and subversive belief that love can still win.  \n  \nIf I’ve read a book four-plus times and it only gets more meaningful, I’d say that’s an endorsement. That also makes _A Seditious Affair_ my most re-read KJ Charles—so far—if only because it had the head start. It’s forever special to me, and the reason I like my romances to be historically accurate. Long live my dear seditious firebrand and his stubborn Tory.\n\nNote: Silas’s foray into [[books/william blake the complete illuminated books|William Blake]] is a good reminder of just how radical (and outlawed) those texts were.","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.104085983Z","tags":[]},"/books/all-about-love":{"title":"All About Love","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.104085983Z","tags":[]},"/books/among-others":{"title":"Among Others","content":"\u003e _“[[notes/bibliotropic|Bibliotropic]],” Hugh said. “Like sunflowers are heliotropic, they naturally turn towards the sun. We naturally turn towards the bookshop.”_\n\nWhere do I begin? What is this book about? Books, yes. A love of books and of libraries. Books as lifeline and language. It’s about a girl growing up, and witches and fairies and boarding schools and grief and Wales and loneliness even amongst those with whom you might belong. It’s the boundary between the real and unreal, magic and the mundane, what it means to have power and sometimes no power at all.\n\nBut what I really love about it is the in-betweenness of it all. It begins where most books would end, after a battle between good and evil which Mori has lost. (Alternately, for this book is full of alternatelys, it’s after Mori is exiled to her estranged father because her mother has gone mad and her sister has died and Mori nearly died herself.) And it ends— not with falling in love, coming of age, or finding where she belongs, but simply filling in another page.\n\nYou can see Mori’s full arc—the adult she’ll become because of the child she’s been—but it’s between the lines. She’s still stuck in between. It’s her adolescence, literally. The cusp, the not-there-yet. She meets a boy, and he’s beautiful and reads Heinlein, but he’s a friend, a right-now, not a soulmate or savior. She faces her mother at last, but it’s not redemption so much as an anticlimax. She makes an effort with her father, but it doesn’t solve their relationship. An ad-hoc [[notes/karass|karass]] still isn’t where she belongs.\n\nIt’s the experience of being fifteen. The power you may or may not have; the responsibility of it. The untrustworthy world, which seems to both hang on your actions and operate without you at all. It’s remarkably clever, this book, where the magic is simply the natural order of things. A bus on time or not; anything that can be denied.\n\nAnd I’m still describing it poorly because this is Jo Walton. It’s not a kid’s book, or a coming of age. It’s not even the science fiction or fantasy that Mori adores. It’s a story, a good one, and it plays with the concept of story itself. Books are Mori’s language. It’s how she communicates, and you see her just dying for someone to listen and then speak the same language. When they do, even imperfectly, it’s on the scale of another book’s grand revelation.\n\nI love her odd little heart. I understand the way her mind works; it’s not unlike my own. I still feel the craving for people who speak the same language, and there’s hope they exist. This is one of those books you can read all kinds of ways because you participate in the story. There are layers and layers. It gives you what you bring to it. And it’s like Mori says, if you love a book enough, the book will love you back.","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.104085983Z","tags":[]},"/books/annals-of-the-former-world":{"title":"Annals of the Former World","content":"\nI’m glad I’m not beyond the age where books I read can change the way I see the world. If that is an age you can reach, I don’t want to. I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.  \n  \nThis was McPhee making a study of that place where language and the earth overlap. Beyond excellent.\n\nNote: this book compiles four different previously published titles: *Basin and Range* (1981), *In Suspect Terrain* (1983), *Rising from the Plains* (1986), and *Assembling California* (1992).\n\nThis description of *Basin and Range* applies to all of it:\n\n\u003e This stretching and folding of language, by which the geologist does to words what endless eons have done to his rocks, excites Mr. McPhee to language experiments of his own. In “Basin and Range,” he is not so much a visiting amateur as a rhapsodist of “[[notes/deep time|deep time]]” like Montaigne, who, centuries before James Hutton, celebrated the mind-stretching eons of change: “The world is but a perennial movement. All things in it are in constant motion—the earth, the rocks of the Caucasus, the pyramids of Egypt—both with the common motion and with their own. Stability itself is nothing but a more languid motion. I cannot keep my subject still. It goes along befuddled and staggering, with a natural drunkness.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Montaigne is a fitting companion for Mr. McPhee, who has the same sort of miscellaneous temperament, the same fascination with odd bits of knowledge. Whether Mr. McPhee writes about bark canoes, the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the Alaskan wilderness or now the “Big Picture” of America's geological history, he is offering us an oddly angled portrait of his own mind, an autobiography made up of shards and pieces, evoked in crisp adventurous prose. And the adventure finally is in the prose. In “Basin and Range” the perspectives and expertise of geology become a language for the drama of time. The result is a fascinating book.[^1]\n\n\n[^1]: [Rhapsodist of Deep Time, Paul Zweig, the New York Times Archives](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/books/rhapsodist-of-deep-time.html)\n","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.104085983Z","tags":[]},"/books/any-old-diamonds":{"title":"Any Old Diamonds","content":"[As KJC says](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2602050279): In which we stick it to a duke. \n\nWhat *[[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]]* was to 2018, _Any Old Diamonds_ is to 2019.

It’s an emotion that we often experience when we fail to set boundaries or ask for what we need, or when expectations let us down because they were based on things we can’t control, like what other people think, what they feel, or how they’re going to react.\n\n\u003e I think it’s important to point out, especially in this political and social climate, that when we feel relieved, grateful, or even happy that someone who has done something hurtful, unethical, or unjust is held accountable, that’s not schadenfreude and normally doesn’t stem from counter-empathy. On the contrary, it can stem from empathy for the aggrieved. It’s similar to the distinction that when we hold someone accountable and they respond to that accountability by feeling shame, it does not mean we’ve shamed them.\n\n\u003e SPOILER ALERT: I’m pretty sure this research explains why I do not like surprises. I’m not a fan of having to manage amplified emotion while in the spotlight. But it’s not just my introversion and the spotlight piece, I don’t like surprises in movies or TV series either. I know many of y’all will find this egregious, but I normally read the entire plot of any potentially stressful movie before I watch it. People assume that ruins it for me, but it doesn’t. I can actually enjoy it better without being thrown off the surprise bridge into amplified emotion. No, thank you.\n\n\u003e “Each person’s grief is as unique as their fingerprint. But what everyone has in common is that no matter how they grieve, they share a need for their grief to be witnessed.\n\u003e That doesn’t mean needing someone to try to lessen it or reframe it for them. The need is for someone to be fully present to the magnitude of their loss without trying to point out the silver lining.” (David Kessler)\n\n\u003e Re: compassion vs. empathy: It’s an important debate that is frustratingly hijacked on occasion by folks who come up with new, arbitrary definitions for emotions that are completely different from how we all use the terms. They change the meaning, then argue that the emotion is “bad” based on their new definitions. For example, someone might say that empathy is taking on all the feelings of another person, then argue that empathy is bad. Unfortunately, this approach is often misleading and self-serving and puts no value on how we use the word. I would argue that a lot of this linguistic shell-gaming is about wanting to be contrarian. There’s nothing more seductive and clickable than a discovery that something we believe to be good is bad: “Empathy is bad for you.” cf. [[Humankind: A Hopeful History]]\n\n\u003e Researcher Matthew Kuan Johnson explains that people find experiences of joy difficult to articulate. He hypothesizes that the very nature of joy pushes the boundaries of our ability to communicate about lived experience via spoken language. ==He also suggests that because language can shape lived experience, cultures that have more words to describe the emotion of joy may also experience joy more richly.==\n\n\u003e “Tranquil environments” provide many restorative elements that are needed to counter mental fatigue and attention depletion. Researchers Rachel and Stephen Kaplan found that there are four essential elements of a restorative environment: a sense of getting away, a feeling of immersion, holding attention without effort, and compatibility with one’s preferences.\n\n\u003e When we lose our tolerance for vulnerability, joy becomes foreboding. No emotion is more frightening than joy, because we believe if we allow ourselves to feel joy, we are inviting disaster. We start dress-rehearsing tragedy in the best moments of our lives in order to stop vulnerability from beating us to the punch. We are terrified of being blindsided by pain, so we practice tragedy and trauma. But there’s a huge cost.\n\n\u003e Anger is a catalyst. Holding on to it will make us exhausted and sick. It’s an emotion that we need to transform into something life-giving: courage, love, change, compassion, justice.\n\u003e Or sometimes anger can mask a far more difficult emotion like grief, regret, or shame, and we need to use it to dig into what we’re really feeling. Either way, anger is a powerful catalyst but a life-sucking companion.\n\n\u003e Humility is openness to new learning combined with a balanced and accurate assessment of our contributions, including our strengths, imperfections, and opportunities for growth.\n\u003e What humility isn’t: downplaying yourself or your accomplishments, which according to researchers is modesty, not humility. It’s also not low self-esteem or meekness or letting people walk all over you.\n","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.104085983Z","tags":[]},"/books/band-sinister":{"title":"Band Sinister","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.104085983Z","tags":[]},"/books/because-internet":{"title":"Because Internet","content":"Ooh, this was FUN.

This should not come as a surprise, because women in general and mothers in particular are required over and over again, under a wide range of circumstances, to put themselves aside, to forget.”\n\n## Motherhood: role or relationship?\n\nDonath argues a distinction between roles and relationships: as long as we frame motherhood as a role, with a rigid set of expectations that mothers are just implicitly expected to be good at, rather than an ever-evolving relationship that flows between mother and child and mother and all the other relationships she has in her life, we limit the emotional reactions mothers are allowed to have to their experiences as mothers and we limit the ways mothers can relate to their lives generally.\n\nSocietally, we’re used to and accept people who regret their marriages because we view that as a relationship between two people. But as long as we keep MOTHER as a role in capital letters, we’re going to keep suffering.\n\nThis is really the crux of the research—by restricting women to roles we refuse to get to know them as individual people. Where would we be if we told the truth to each other, and ourselves?\n\n## Category violation\n\n\u003e “If we realize that part of being a subject is to make calculations and weigh one’s options about what is valuable and worthwhile for one’s own life, then we can understand the wider meanings of the social expectations that mothers will not weigh their options and make evaluations regarding their motherhood. In other words, the social reaction to regret as a horrifying rationality demonstrates how mothers are deprived of their right to stay connected to their own understandings and, experiences and the intimate relationships in which they are involved. They cannot even pause for a minute to assess the state of their motherhood and their own lives, because ==it is too frightening to society – which depends upon mothers as objects who exist for the sake of others –when they do not stay put as such.==”\n\nVery very closely linked to the moral panics about queer sexuality, gender, etc. etc. In a hierarchal society violations of category cannot be tolerated, because the existence of the hierarchy depends on the enforcement of the categories.\n\n\u003e Since the nineteenth century, nationalist, capitalist, heteronormative, and patriarchal ideologies have joined hands to sustain this gendered division of labor — because without women’s unpaid labor as mothers and homemakers, the system would fall apart - while stressing that this division is ‘natural,’ and therefore eternal.\n\nIf they are so natural and eternal, why would they have to be vigilantly policed and enforced?\n## The ultimate taboo\n\nEven as some of our categories get more fluid or roles get reevaluated, it is still the ultimate taboo in society, women who regret becoming mothers. Yes, women can have careers, but they MUST be moms. Yes, women can be gay, but they MUST be moms. And they must WANT to be moms.\n\nOur social structure relies on the silencing of women who do not want to be mothers, or who regret becoming mothers. ==The status quo subjugation of women is reliant on women being denied emotional agency to feel however they feel about their lives and circumstances.==\n\nHow do we change the conversation? By telling the truth about the experiences that ALL women have, in all the diversity of our needs, yearnings, dreams, and realities.\n\nThe worst thing that we can do for mothers and children alike is pretend that there is one clear path for everyone.\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e When it comes to reproduction and the transition to motherhood, it is crucial to cast doubt on this rhetoric of all-embracing choice: how much room to maneuver do women actually have if we are free to choose only _what society wants us to choose?_\n\n\u003e The statement ‘I love my children but regret my motherhood’ is very often seen as impossible by definition — because doesn’t a wish to erase motherhood mean a wish to erase those children she loves? Yet a statement such as ‘I love him, but I regret I ever met him’ following a painful romantic relationship would hardly be considered paradoxical. In other words, it may be the sacredness we have placed on motherhood that prevents us from accepting that a woman can both love _and_ acknowledge the broader implications of that love in her life.\n\n\u003e On one hand, facing them [the accounts of regretted motherhood] may have torturous consequences; on the other hand, avoiding them may prevent us from understanding social worlds and changing them for the benefit of those who suffer from them. With this in mind, I believe the question ‘Why talk about regretting motherhood?’ should be flipped the other way around: What are the consequences of silencing regret over motherhood? Who pays the price when we try to pretend it does not exist?","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.124086136Z","tags":[]},"/books/seven-surrenders":{"title":"Seven Surrenders","content":"There’s no way I can talk comprehensively about this series, so for now I’m just going to keep a running list of different things I notice each time I read them.

And I realized, I still hadn’t come up with words to talk about it yet, how the first two books of the series encapsulate 2020 for me in a specific and uncanny way, a century past the series’ historical setting, the same kinds of stresses and shifts going on in the world, and now the third installment does the same with 2021. \n\nIt IS the 2021 mood for me, in so many respects. Okay, but not okay. Out of the woods, but not yet. Boredom, but chaos. One day at a time. The ground not exactly steady under anyone’s feet. \n\nBut also the glimmer of sunlight a long way down the tunnel. The cracks and the fissures. The exhale. The shift. The amount of vulnerability and love packed in the “I’ve wondered where you were hiding the damage” scene is three books worth of payoff and it’s made me cry each time I’ve read it. I’ve never identified with Will more. And yet with all the serious stakes, the book sparkles like Phoebe walking into a room, radiating joy and goodwill. \n \nI don’t know how KJ Charles does it. Much less how she did it during this year. She dug deep, and it shows, an emotional depth that I dare say surpasses even what she’s written before. Just Kim’s transformation alone is gorgeous. Several times I kept thinking, who are you, and what have you done with Lord Arthur Aloysius Kimberly de Brabazon Secretan? In the best way, because he’s still utterly Kim, the true Kim at the core. \n\nI do need to state one final thing: my undying devotion for a book that FINALLY makes the threat of an inherited title the worst possible outcome to be avoided at all costs. She takes the marriage of convenience trope (darling, we must commit ourselves prematurely to secure title, wealth, and societal approval) and does the inverse (Darling, we must rid ourselves of this blight at all costs because it will quite literally be the end of life and love as we know it and the only way we’ll be whole and healthy is to refuse to participate). \n\nI keep thinking, this is what happens when you really queer history. Or, eh, queer the pulp fiction version of it anyway. You get to consider the inverse of things. Disrupt the idea, for one, that love = possession, or that there’s any scarcity in it. Explore the margins. Question the narrative. Rethink a few key assumptions. Step outside prescribed roles. See what else is possible when guided by tenderness and vulnerability, instead of propriety and power.\n\nWhat other tropes—what other trajectories of history—what other scripts that we follow—could be turned upside down?","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.124086136Z","tags":[]},"/books/sugared-game":{"title":"The Sugared Game","content":"The reason it takes me a week to read a book that I literally can’t put down is because I read it twice.  \n  \nWhen I read *[[books/slippery creatures|Slippery Creatures]]*, I wanted to say, this is what it looks like when an author levels up. I refrained, but I’m not going to wait til book three to say it: this is what it looks like when an author levels up.  \n  \nThe Will/Kim dynamic isn’t one I’ve seen her write before. Especially with Phoebe and Maisie taking such an integral part; especially given that it gets three books to play out. She takes her time in setting up the layers of trust and conflict, and it builds up as beautifully as anything could. I like books that build. I tend to use “slow burn” derogatorily because too often it’s stalling, and it’s not a good descriptor here either. But there’s a long, slow build over two books now and counting, all with satisfactory payoffs each step of the way, all with the fun, pulpy trappings of the genre, and it feels so deeply gratifying that I go speechless like Will, confounded and impressed.  \n  \nThe plot hustles, the characters twist and develop, and yet what sticks out to me is how much talking there is. Scene after scene after long scene after chapter of Will and Kim talking, a whole book of Will and Kim talking, in a way that feels like what a romance should be. I know an author’s got me completely when the conversation is even better than the sex. And it’s _really_ good sex.  \n  \nOh yeah, and remember how Will was my favorite? Nope, Kim. Kim, Kim.

We’re not looking for play, or seasonal variations of social structures, or the essential involvement of women, so that has been left out of the story. \n\nWe need to approach the evidence of the human past with fresh eyes.

But it aims to answer many of the same questions in a different way. There is no doubt that something has gone terribly wrong with the world. A very small percentage of its population do control the fates of almost everyone else, and they are doing it in an increasingly disastrous fashion. To understand how this situation came about, we should trace the problem back to what first made possible the emergence of kings, priests, overseers and judges. But we no longer have the luxury of assuming we already know in advance what the precise answers will turn out to be.\n\n* This different view of the past is basically [[Science fictional behavior]]\n* The myth of the agricultural revolution \n* Seasonal variations of social structure  (reminds me of seasonal gender in [[books/the left hand of darkness]]\n* Also seasonal flooding with flood retreat farming (cf.

Theirs was not a science of domination and classification, but one of bending and coaxing, nurturing and cajoling, or even tricking the forces of nature, to increase the likelihood of securing a favourable outcome. Their ‘laboratory’ was the real world of plants and animals, whose innate tendencies they exploited through close observation and experimentation.

Puar brings her pathbreaking work on the liberal state, sexuality, and biopolitics to bear on our understanding of disability. Drawing on a stunning array of theoretical and methodological frameworks, Puar uses the concept of “debility”—bodily injury and social exclusion brought on by economic and political factors—to disrupt the category of disability. She shows how debility, disability, and capacity together constitute an assemblage that states use to control populations. Puar’s analysis culminates in an interrogation of Israel’s policies toward Palestine, in which she outlines how Israel brings Palestinians into biopolitical being by designating them available for injury. Supplementing its right to kill with what Puar calls the right to maim, the Israeli state relies on liberal frameworks of disability to obscure and enable the mass debilitation of Palestinian bodies. Tracing disability’s interaction with debility and capacity, Puar offers a brilliant rethinking of Foucauldian biopolitics while showing how disability functions at the intersection of imperialism and racialized capital.","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.124086136Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-ruin-of-gabriel-ashleigh":{"title":"The Ruin of Gabriel Ashleigh","content":"Why yes, I’m re-reading the whole series in order, even the miscellany.

One of the best books I’ve read about healing from abuse, dysfunction, and trauma. So much to relate to on every page (and not just because she had the same [Jimmy Eat World song ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-HPOHu8mY) as a lifeline in the early aughts).\n\nIt’s heartbreaking and eye-opening that her upbringing (Asian, middle-class, immigrant; raised in what she correctly calls the wreckage of America’s brutal proxy wars against communism) is almost a 1:1 overlap with what was going on behind the scenes for almost everyone I knew growing up (white, middle-class, evangelical; basically the inheritors of the “American dream”). \n\nThe punishment, dysfunction, shame, rejection, generational trauma, and often the outright abuse (sexual, physical, mental) that just got silenced and covered up. When kids need literally the exact opposite to survive: love, acceptance, safety, trust, respect. A voice. \n\n\u003e I am a product of a place. I am one of many. All of us are victims of a dysfunctional community that was very good at throttling itself while murmuring, “Smile through your tears. Swallow your pain.”\n\u003e \n\u003e It is within this normalcy, this transformation of a unique misery into the utterly banal, that I finally feel empowered. Maybe I can change my programming after all. Because the more common the disease, the more survivors there must be. A whole damn neighborhood can’t go down together in its entirety, can it? There have to be people who escape the stranglehold.\n\nIt’s so validating when the key things that help her heal are the same things I’ve discovered. Note: she does *not* break it down into 1-2-3 steps for healing; these are my own notes, a list I made when what worked for her has worked for me as well: \n\n- Self-regulation (calming your nervous system, creating an internal sense of safety)\n- Curiosity (instead of judging or shutting down emotions, befriend them and listen to them; learn who you are when no one else is around)\n- Compassion (every trigger has a purpose; learn to ask “what is this? What is this thing in my body right now? What are you trying to teach me?”)\n- Communication (complex trauma is fundamentally relational trauma—people who were supposed to be caring and trustworthy and safe were hurtful instead; practice healthy relationships)\n- Agency (you have power, you have choice, you have a voice)\n- Love (love, love, love, in abundance, for others, for yourself; the opposite of shame, blame, and fear is love)\n\nThere’s no single magic fix; there’s a mix of what works for each person at various points in their lives. But there is healing, and hope, and I love her definition of both:\n\n\u003e So this is healing, then, the opposite of the ambiguous dread: *fullness*. I am full of anger, pain, peace, love, of horrible shards and exquisite beauty, and the lifelong challenge will be to balance all of those things, while keeping them in the circle. Healing is never final. It is never perfection. But along with the losses are the triumphs.\n\n---\n\n### Pull quotes: \n\n\u003e *It’s okay to have some things you never get over.* In the span of half an hour, this man whom I had known for less than a season did what nobody in my life ever had: He took all of my sins and simply forgave them. He didn’t demand relentless improvement. There were no ultimatums. He asserted that I was enough, as is. The gravity of it stunned me into silence. Joey was the opposite of the dread.\n\n\u003e My family tried to erase this history. But my body remembers. My work ethic. My fear of cockroaches. My hatred for the taste of dirt. These are not random attributes, a spin of the wheel. They were gifted to me with purpose, with necessity.\n\u003e \n\u003e I want to have words for what my bones know. I want to use those gifts when they serve me and understand and forgive them when they do not.\n\n\u003e The brain’s fear reflex is very real. But it has an opposite force, too, as ancient and as powerful. Our bodies and brains melt into kindness in the presence of one key ingredient. “This school made me feel like I was somewhere where people actually loved me.”\n\n\u003e But more and more, I am curious enough to ask the magic question: “What do you need?” These four words open doors and break down walls. With the benefit of understanding, we are no longer two separate beings floating through these threads alone. We are giving and receiving. Two reciprocal atoms hugging each other through the turmoil around us. *I hurt you. You hurt me. You’re mine.*\n\n\u003e PTSD is only a mental illness in times of peace.

I saw someone call him the original troll—that too, the radical printmaker in the time when printmaking was a real threat to the established order. Blake harnessed its power, provoking the church and state with his unorthodox satire.  \n  \nMy favorite work of his is probably easy to guess: A Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  \n  \nAt the chaotic end of the 18th century, William Blake, radical, takes aim at Swedenborg, theologian, for his treatise on the afterlife. He scorns Swedenborg’s theology, claiming it full of “all the old falsehoods.” In fact, Blake takes offense at his lack of creativity as much as his stolid ideas: dividing heaven from hell, soul from body, angels from devils, sinners from saints.  \n  \nIn Blake’s cosmology, there’s no division, just one whole. He flips the script, giving “the Devil” a voice that sounds awfully sensible. ‘Heaven’ is the staid authority, certainty, order; ‘Hell,’ therefore, according to Blake, is the necessary energy of humanity. Passion, chaos, creativity, emotion, desire. You can’t call one good and one evil, he contends, without an irrevocable loss. “Without contraries there is no progression.” In his fervent vision, we ARE the divine, soul and body together, good and evil together, culminating in his epiphany: “for every thing that lives is Holy.”  \n  \nAt around 15 pages, this work somehow feels like a magnum opus. What Blake calls his “Proverbs of Hell” are frank and energetic: “The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.” “What is now proved was once only imagin’d.” His art fills the page, clotting the margins with childlike intensity. It’s provocative and irreverent, disconcerting and droll, ingenious and moving.\n  \nTo be fair, C.S. Lewis comes for Blake in turn, undoing his great marriage in *The Great Divorce*. But arguably, Blake has outlasted Swedenborg. Arguably, he’ll outlast Lewis too. Life has a way of overturning the certainties. And thus Blake resonates, at least with me, in a way his rivals don’t. The contradictions are necessary. We could do worse than to listen, embrace the energy and the passion, the chaos and the doubt.","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.124086136Z","tags":[]},"/books/word-by-word":{"title":"Word by Word","content":"I love words, I love English, and there is no way I could be a lexicographer. I will never read a dictionary the same way again. This was even more interesting than I hoped it would be.\n\n\u003e I call it “craft” and not “art” for connotative reasons. “Art” conjures an image of the lexicographer as medium or conduit— a live wire that merely transmits something unkenned, alien. But “craft” implies care, repetitive work, apprenticeship, and practice. It is something within most people’s reach, but few people devote themselves to it long enough and with enough intensity to do it well. That sort of dedication to words comes across as batty, so we speak in metaphor. Defining is the mental equivalent of free throws in basketball: anyone can stand at the free-throw line and sink one occasionally; everyone gets lucky. But the pro is the person who stands at the free-throw line for hours, months, years, perfecting that one motion until it is as fail-safe as humanly possible, until it looks so much like second nature that an uncoordinated clod like me can watch them lob a rare miss at the net during a game and say, “Are you *kidding?* How easy is it to shoot a free throw?”\n\n## Stray notes\n\n* The wonky rules of English! (use the open compound “back seat” in the phrase “take a back seat” but the closed “backseat” when referring to the seats behind the driver, etc etc)\n* Asimov: “My opinions are strong, but not necessarily authoritative. Please realize that.” \n* “Pumpernickel,” traced back to its Germanic origins, means “fart goblin” \n* Worcester’s publishers steadfastly refused to bow to the vulgarity of cheap advertising, while the Merriam brothers went bonkers for it. “Get the best!” ads in 1849 proclaimed and never really stopped. \n* “She looked world-weary, like a circus clown two shows away from retirement, dolefully waiting for the inevitable pie right in the smacker.”\n* They’ll notice errors, but you can’t notice excellence in a dictionary because it consists of a lack of errors.\n\n---\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e “The fact is that many of the things that are presented to us as rules are really just the of-the-moment preferences of people who have had the opportunity to get their opinions published and whose opinions end up being reinforced and repeated down the ages as Truth.” p. 48\n\n\u003e The history of English is full of messiness and illogic because the English language is a true democracy, built entirely by the people who use and have used it, and people, generally speaking, are messy and illogical. p. 182\n\n\u003e Etymological fallacy is the worst sort of pedantry: a meaningless personal opinion trying to dress itself up as concern for preserving historical principles. It misses that language changes itself is a historical principle: a language that doesn’t change is a dead language, and as much as etymological fallacists seem to love the purity of Latin, you’ll notice that none of them have abandoned that whore English for it. p. 184\n\n\u003e Like everyone else, lexicographers need to move faster. This is, to be frank, nothing new: we have always felt the heavy thumb of business concerns whenever we define. And while defining gets easier with experience, and the easier it is to do something, the faster you can do it, there is a terminal velocity in lexicography. After a certain point, you simply can’t go any faster; to do so compromises the quality of what you’re doing. p. 259\n","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.124086136Z","tags":[]},"/books/zealot":{"title":"Zealot","content":"Great at painting a picture of 1st century Palestine.

B. Tylor.)\n\nFor self-identified animists, Graham Harvey explains, “the world and its various powers are neither good nor bad… but open, efficacious, and above all, relational.”\n\nTim Ingold: “We are dealing here not with a way of believing about the world, but with a condition of living in it.”\n\nFar from abolishing or preventing distinctions, then, this sort of animacy produces differences locally and interactively. Beings become the kind of beings they are in relation to the other beings who interact with them in a particular time and place.\n\nThe result of this dynamic, relational structure is not uniformity, all-is-oneness, or a “pudding of one identity,” but “a web of interdependencies.” (cf. [[private/holobionts]])\n\n---\n## The indigenous attribution of agency\n\nPer Mary-Jane Rubenstein in *[[books/pantheologies|Pantheologies]]*:\n\nEach creature is directly responsible for the well-being of many beings at many times, but not for all beings at all times, and these “overlap[ping] connections” sustain a community united not by its identity to itself, but by its complex, mobile, and interrelated differentiations.\n\nAs one might note, however, these distinctions (between the physical and the metaphysical, the this-worldly and the otherworldly, or the religious and the ethical) are rooted in the oppositions between spirit and matter, creator and created, that “animism” purportedly rejects.\n\nThe implication is that the indigenous attribution of agency and even personhood to vegetal life is not irrational, infantile, narcissistic, or delusional (which is to say, religious); to the contrary, these insights are so sophisticated that “plant science” has confirmed them.\n\nAnd it is precisely at this point that indigenous philosophies might congratulate earth-systems science for having finally caught up to what it has known all along; as Vine Deloria attests, “traditional Indians,” who have always asserted the animacy of the universe, “are quite amused to see this revival of the debate over whether the planet is alive.”","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.124086136Z","tags":["nature"]},"/notes/apophatic-naming":{"title":"Apophatic naming","content":"Apophatic naming, or negative naming, is the attempt to call a thing by so many names that its essential nature transcends all of them.

Far enemies are the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. For example, a near enemy of loving-kindness is sentimentality—similar but different. A far enemy of loving-kindness is ill will—the opposite of loving-kindness. Similarly, a near enemy of compassion is pity and a far enemy is cruelty.”\n\n\u003e The near enemies depict how spirituality can be misunderstood or misused to separate us from life. (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e I define spirituality as the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to each other by something greater than ourselves. I have friends who are atheists who every day practice inextricable connection—they hurt when others hurt and they know that none of us are free until all of us are free. I have friends who talk endlessly about their religion and wear scripture on their T-shirts, yet demonstrate no connection to anyone’s suffering but their own and maybe that of the people in their immediate circle. I make this point because we’re not talking about religion here. We’re talking about the irrepressible human spirit.\n\n\u003e On the surface, the near enemies of emotions or experiences might look and even feel like connection, but ultimately they drive us to be disconnected from ourselves and from each other. Without awareness, near enemies become the practices that fuel separation, rather than practices that reinforce the inextricable connection of all people.\n\n\u003e “The near enemy of love is attachment. Attachment masquerades as love. It says, “I will love this person (because I need something from them).” Or, “I’ll love you if you’ll love me back. I’ll love you, but only if you will be the way I want.” This isn’t the fullness of love. Instead there is attachment—there is clinging and fear.

Rather, debility is what happens when a state makes an entire population available for mass injury — a denial of disability rights altogether.[^1]\n\nThis leads to cognitive dissonance and egregious hypocrisy, where a state perpetuating *genocide* can nonetheless claim themselves a champion of disability justice within that framework of disability rights:\n\n\u003e Israel is, in fact, a signatory on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

It is a haven of self-compassion, an invitation, a last protection.\n\nBrown classifies despair as the permanent state of hopelessness, whereas Whyte calls it, “strangely, the last bastion of hope,” which turns to depression and abstraction when we try to make it stay beyond its appointed season. (So still the emphasis on the necessary and *seasonal* state of *repair*.)\n\n\u003e Despair is kept alive by freezing our sense of time and the rhythms of [[notes/concepts of time|time]]; when we no longer feel imprisoned by time, and when the season is allowed to turn, despair cannot survive.\n\nThis feels like it can encompass more of what I classify as despair, which is usually part anguish, part grief, part shutdown, overwhelmed by something I no longer want to be a part of. (The ongoing US-backed genocide in Palestine; the climate crisis; every war across the globe.) \n\nIn *Atlas*, it’s more personal, and doesn’t really include that *necessary* need for hibernation and repair. What Whyte calls a difficult, beautiful necessity, as human beings caught in a fierce and difficult world where half of our experience is mediated by loss.\n\nAnd how to emerge, when nothing is in one’s control to fix? By giving the despair a profound and courageous attention. \n\n\u003e To see and experience despair fully in our body is to begin to see it as a necessary, seasonal visitation, and the first step in letting it have its own life, neither holding it nor moving it on before its time.\n\nBasically, you could say it is a waveform, not a prison: \n\n\u003e We take the first steps out of despair by taking on its full weight and coming fully to ground in our wish not to be here. We let our bodies and we let our world breathe again.

In this way, the laws of chemistry can be said to be emergent from physics: the laws of chemistry presuppose the laws of physics, but can’t simply be reduced to them.

They energize us for fight-and-flight and live in our limbic system. \n\n**Routine emotions** such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and anger nourish our lives, lasting for a while then fading. Humans, on average 30 or more different emotional states every day. These emotions don’t require thought—they occur as a matter of course, and originate in the sensory part of the brain. (Note: it is likely the routine emotions that are hardest for people with alexithymia to access.)\n\n**Reflective emotions** such as anger, grief, and jealousy occur primarily in our prefrontal cortex and require conscious thought. \n\nReactive emotions are some of the hardest ones to cool off. These are happening in the limbic and survival portions of the brain, and our prefrontal cortex is what houses our executive functioning and observing self. When this part of our brain is online, we’re more easily able to calm ourselves down. But that is the precise part of the brain that tends to go offline during emotionally intense moments. Some studies have shown that ADHDers and Autistic people have reduced connectivity between the more emotional centers of our brains and our prefrontal cortex, and must work harder to bring the prefrontal cortex back online during emotionally hot moments.\n\nWhen we can take two seconds to pause and identify the emotion, we are bringing observing and reflective self to the forefront, which helps to bring our prefrontal cortex back online. This helps calm the whole system down.  When we label our emotions, we recruit our prefrontal cortex to come help down-regulate the limbic system and so-called “reptilian brain.” \n\nThis is likely one reason we see increased rates of anxiety among people with alexithymia. Because they cannot label their emotions, they aren’t as easily able to recruit their prefrontal cortex to help out and self-soothe when their fear system gets activated. So for people who struggle with emotional regulation or alexithymia, emotional labeling can be particularly helpful in developing effective self-soothing and coping strategies.\n\nSource: [Neurodivergent Insights - Emotional Identification](https://neurodivergentinsights.com/blog/emotional-identification)","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.124086136Z","tags":["therapy","autism","emotional-intelligence"]},"/notes/endurance":{"title":"The Chinese word for endurance","content":"In *[[books/what my bones know|What My Bones Know]]*, [[authors/stephanie foo|Stephanie Foo]] says:\n\n\u003e It made perfect sense to me later in life when I discovered that the Chinese word for endurance is simply the word _knife_ on top of the word _heart_.

Queen Elizabeth proclaimed a set of laws designed to maintain order and contribute to the general good of the kingdom: **the English Poor Laws**.  These laws remained in force for more than 250 years with only minor changes. Essentially, the laws distinguished ==three major categories of dependents: the vagrant, the involuntary unemployed, and the helpless==. The laws also set forth ways and means for dealing with each category of dependents. Most important, the laws established the parish (i.e.,local government), acting through an overseer of the poor appointed by local officials, as the administrative unit for executing the law.\n\u003e\n\u003e The poor laws gave the local government the power to raise taxes as needed and use the funds to build and maintain almshouses; to provide indoor relief (i.e., cash or sustenance) for the aged, handicapped and other ==worthy poor==; and the tools and materials required to put the unemployed to work. Parents were required to support their children and grandchildren. ==Likewise, children were responsible for the care of their unemployable parents and grandparents.== Children whose parents could not support them were forced into mandatory apprenticeships. ==They had no right to object== to the compensation or the interference with their own child-rearing activities. Vagrants and ==any able bodied persons who refused to work== could be committed to a house of correction or fined.\n\u003e\n\u003e In response to concerns that dependent persons would move to parishes where financial assistance was more generous, ==in 1662 a severe **Law of Settlement and Removal** was enacted in England==. The law made it possible for local authorities to force individuals and families to leave a town and return to their home parish if they became dependent. In effect, this law allowed a local government to restrict aid only to persons and families known to be “residents.”\n\u003e\n\u003e==The American colonies and state governments== modeled their public assistance for the poor on the **Elizabethan Poor Laws and the Law of Settlement and Removal**.\n\nNote the sorting into categories, the “worthy poor,” the children with no right to object, the laws of increasing severity in order to close the loopholes.

This rhetorical background served to explain the acquisition of territories or reasons to go to war, such as the war with Mexico in 1840s.\n\nOutside the United States, the effects of manifest destiny were seen in U.S. intervention in the Spanish-American war when Spain ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico and Guam to the U.S. This was an expansion of U.S. territory as colonies rather than states and was ==another demonstration of growing U.S. imperialism==.\n\nThe term of ‘Manifest Destiny’ first appeared in a newspaper article on the annexation of Texas in edition from July/August of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review in 1845. The author, John L. O’Sullivan used it to describe what majority of Americans at the time believed was ==their mission from God: to expand to west and bring the United States government to unenlightened people==.\n\nSee also: [The Religious Origins of Manifest Destiny](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01gwbag7mpybwtjdb3ffnjhvnd)\n","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["historical-precedents"]},"/notes/memes-and-social-movements":{"title":"Memes and social movements","content":"\n\u003e “Why do games like FarmVille and Pokémon Go periodically sweep social media?

It’s maddening, it’s challenging. It’s delightful. It’s a heady rush of satisfaction when the pieces start to click. It’s completely different from worldbuilding that stays dense, illogical, and nonsensical. A lazy author not even bothering to build a puzzle is detectable at first glance from the author you won’t be able to understand until the second read.\n\nIt takes trust. Trust from the author in the reader, and trust from the reader in the author. I won’t trust the author until I can tell they’ve put their trust in me.\n\n[[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]], puzzle-book writer extraordinaire, talks about this in her introduction to *[[books/shadow \u0026 claw|Shadow \u0026 Claw]]*:\n\n\u003e Reading for world-building is a skill. I have seen brilliant people, laureates, inventors, Ph.D.s, try to read fiction with deep world-building and fail completely, looping back, rereading, never following events, trapped in a sense of muddled wandering. Reading for world-building requires retaining information without context: a term, a place, a coin, a category comes up once and we know what that is—a puzzle piece—that our task is to gather up these pieces as the author drops them, and to slowly assemble the whole. This is not easy. Human memory needs hooks for facts: a mnemonic, a story, context, something; grueling textbook rote-learning fades quickly, but a story of the statesman or the king, that’s what makes knowledge stay.\n\nInterestingly, she notes this is a skill kids seem to have naturally: \n\n\u003e To retain puzzle pieces that don’t connect, dropped without context, is a skill that not all have. All had it once: it is how children read, every book, poster, and headline a stream of unknown terms, far too many to ask about them all, but the child retains them, trusting that they will connect to something someday. ==Kids collect Earth’s puzzle pieces every time they read, but as we move to grown-up books they all use the same picture, and define immediately those terms they fear a reader may not know. Thus the skill of keeping puzzle pieces fades, unless we read books set in other worlds, new puzzle pictures which make us retain the skill, as frogs sometimes retain their tadpole tails into adulthood.== This—many have observed—is why most F\u0026SF readers come to the genre young, it’s hard to start in adulthood when one’s puzzle-memory skill has sat atrophied.\n\nShe goes on to say that [[authors/gene wolfe|Gene Wolfe]] asks even more, and that like learning to swim before one swims for fun, in many ways one reads the [[series/the book of the new sun|Book of the New Sun]] only on the second pass.\n\nNo wonder my childlike puzzle-loving brain loves this kind of deep worldbuilding. Think [[series/terra ignota|Terra Ignota]], [[series/the locked tomb|The Locked Tomb]], *[[books/china mountain zhang|China Mountain Zhang]]*, or even books like *[[books/among others|Among Others]]* with their own internal logic and language.

Le Guin]]\n\n*Ed. note: just me copying and annotating this text in full, it’s that brilliant.*\n\n\u003e In the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable. Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein.== And we didn’t even work hard at it — much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else’s field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\u003e\n\u003eFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn’t have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. ==It wasn’t the meat that made the difference. It was the story.==\n\u003e \n\u003e It is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\u003e \n\u003eThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn’t their story. It’s his.\n\u003e \n\u003e When she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, Virginia Woolf wrote a heading in her notebook, “Glossary”; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. ==One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as “botulism.” And _hero_, in Woolf’s dictionary, is “bottle.” The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.==\n\u003e \n\u003e Not just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you haven’t got something to put it in, food will escape you — even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it’s cold and raining and wouldn’t it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn’t it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e *The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.*\n\u003e \n\u003e So says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women’s Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don’t know. I don’t even care. I’m not telling that story. ==We’ve heard it, we’ve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.==\n\u003e \n\u003e And yet old. Before — once you think about it, surely long before — the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger — for what’s the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can’t eat home in — with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\u003e \n\u003e This theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. ==(“What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman’s lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,” Lillian Smith observed.)== The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that’s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\u003e \n\u003e That’s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\u003e \n\u003e Go on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\u003e\n\u003e If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it’s useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again — if to do that is human, if that’s what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.\n\u003e \n\u003e Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don’t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It’s just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.\n\u003e\n\u003e It sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we’d better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one’s finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\u003e \n\u003e It’s unfamiliar, it doesn’t come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, “untold” was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\u003e \n\u003e ==The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story.== Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn’t any good if he isn’t in it.\n\u003e\n\u003e I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. ==A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.==\n\u003e \n\u003e One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but ==the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd.== (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, “A story should be seen as a battle,” and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\u003e\n\u003e Finally, it’s clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. ==You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.==\n\u003e\n\u003e That is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\u003e\n\u003e So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse’s skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don’t understand. ==I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn’t say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?==\n\u003e \n\u003e If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. “Technology,” or “modern science” (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the “hard” sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\u003e \n\u003e If, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time’s-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\u003e \n\u003e Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else ==in this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story.== In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool’s joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn’t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\nSource: https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["storytelling","creative-process"]},"/notes/the-curse-of-latin-y-grammar":{"title":"The curse of Latin-y grammar","content":"\nThe Latin-worshipping tradition is responsible for the grammar elitism of infinitive splitting, proposition ending, and the singular “they.”\n\nRobert Lowth, who wrote a widely used English grammar in 1792, passed an aesthetic judgment on the sentence-ending preposition (it wasn’t Latin-y enough), and later grammarians elevated this preference to a full-on ban.\n\nBy similar specious reasoning, they objected to infinitive splitting and the singular ‘they,’ despite centuries of prior English usage. \n\nThis is the same tradition responsible for adding a bunch of superfluous silent letters to words like “dete,” “samoun,” and “iland,” because “debt,” “salmon,” and “island” look more like Latin “debitum,” “salmonem,” and “insula.” (Never mind that “island” doesn’t even come from Latin, or that generations of schoolchildren would now have to go to extra effort.

Distrust is when you feel “what is important to me is not safe with this person.” That lack of safety makes authenticity and vulnerability difficult for fear of betrayal (rightly so!).\n\nIn [[books/atlas of the heart|Atlas of the Heart]], [[brene brown|Brené Brown]] lists seven specific trustworthy behaviors:\n\n1. **Boundaries**—You respect my boundaries, and when you’re not clear about what’s okay and no okay, you ask. You’re willing to say no.\n2. **Reliability**—You do what you say you’ll do. This includes how you don’t overpromise and are able to deliver on commitments.\n3. **Accountability**—You own your mistakes, apologize, and make amends.\n4. **Confidentiality**—You don’t share information or experiences that are not yours to share. *(Note: she calls this “vault,” I renamed because the grammatical inconsistency was bugging me, haha)*\n5. **Integrity**—You choose courage over comfort. You choose what is right over what is fast, fun, or easy. And you choose to practice your values rather than simply professing them.\n6. **Nonjudgment**—I can ask for what I need, and you can ask for what you need. We can talk about how we feel or ask for help without judgment. \n7. **Generosity**—You extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others.\n\n## Self-trust\n\nThis applies to self-trust as well: \n\n1. **Boundaries**—Did I respect my own boundaries? Was I clear about what’s okay and not okay?\n2. **Reliability**—Was I reliable? Did I do what I said I was going to do?\n3. **Accountability**—Did I hold myself accountable?\n4. **Confidentiality**—Did I respect the vault and share appropriately?\n5. **Integrity**—Did I act from my integrity?\n6. **Nonjudgment**—Did I ask for what I needed? Was I nonjudgmental about needing help?\n7. **Generosity**—Was I generous to myself?\n\nOr, per Istavan in Paladin’s Strength, trust is faith plus predictability. 🙃","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["therapy","emotional-intelligence"]},"/notes/theology-of-capitalism":{"title":"The theology of capitalism","content":"\n\u003e We have mostly forgotten to be surprised that a street preacher’s followers discovered, several hundred years after his death, how to be a regimented multinational corporate enterprise. *([[books/pagans|Pagans]], [[authors/james j o'donnell|James J. O’Donnell]])*\n\nIn *[[books/all about love|All About Love]]*, [[authors/bell hooks|bell hooks]] (via Erich Fromm) says the principle underlying capitalistic society and the principle of love are incompatible. This poses an interesting dilemma for a religion that purports to be, indeed, all about love.\n\nUnfortunately, when that dilemma rears its head, we’ve seen the church support colonialism, industrial capitalism, greed, abuse and exploitation over the opposite. \n\nIn *[[books/pantheologies|Pantheologies]]*, [[authors/mary-jane rubenstein|Mary-Jane Rubenstein]] posits that the Protestant Reformation laid the groundwork for our mechanistic science—and vice versa. The Protestant iconoclasm and denial of transubstantiation drained spirit out of the material world, so it was perfectly poised to pair up with early capitalism, which had to exploit to survive.\n\n\u003e In other words, the recoding of animal, mineral, vegetable, and nonwhite human lives as machinery conditioned their unrestrained exploitation—an exploitation that would have been impossible without the rigorously anti-pantheological operations of imperial Christianity. *(Pantheologies)*\n\nI like the term imperial Christianity… basically Paul + everything after? This leads to a totalitarian theology, ironically professing to love all while only operating in service of [[notes/who is more deserving|those who are worthy]]. But lest we lay all the blame on the Protestants, Christianity long before then had become rooted in exploitation and violence: \n\n\u003e Hence, it was Christian for the Saxons to submit to “Holy Roman” imperial violence, to be crucified like Christ. The Carolingians constructed a Christian piety that used violence to convert pagans and then taught its victims to regard their violation as justified and sanctified.[^1]\n\nThis is the very same concept was perpetuated via [[notes/manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]. Once the colonies were settled, it became America’s founding myth. They had already inherited this legacy of violence, us vs. them, and either had to renounce their beliefs (so difficult!) or see themselves as superior and entitled to conquer this land. \n\n\u003e Puritan religious piety could not teach the equilibrium and equanimity needed to heal from horror, to relinquish fear, to forgive their enemies or themselves, and to repair harm. They lacked the spiritual disciplines that taught them to observe the world carefully, to trust the senses, and to wonder at the beauty of the land.[^2]\n\nThus the groundwork was laid, and all around us we see a blind, unquestioned belief in those principles. “Just because a myth is old doesn’t mean it’s healthy.”[^3] [[notes/fluid stories|What can our new myths be?]]\n\n[^1]: Rebecca Ann Parker and Rita Nakashima Brock, *Saving Paradise*\n[^2]: *ibid*\n[^3]: Sophie Strand, *The Flowering Wand*","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["belief-systems"]},"/notes/untamed-episode-notes":{"title":"The Untamed episode notes 《陈情令》","content":"\nMy raw notes for *The Untamed*, started when I was trying to make sense of the plot but now an indispensable resource for fic.

Only early citation I could find is [a JSTOR article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26281186) from 1983 which, from the preview, seems to be discussing Arno Schmidt’s *Leviathan*. So maybe an obscure term (possibly in translation?) that Ada popularized, at least? \n\nAnyway. Vocateur (“voker” for short) is basically someone intensely devoted to their vocation. In the post-scarcity world of Terra Ignota, careers are a thing of the past, no one needs to earn their basic necessities, and one is not permitted to work more than a certain number of hours per week (10 I think?). Vocateurs apply for the permission to work extended hours on their passions. \n\nFrom [an interview with Ada](https://mrissa.livejournal.com/966088.html?): \n\n\u003e I’ve been delighted to have a lot of readers respond enthusiastically to voker/vocateur, and I do think it’s something we see every day but don’t have a good name for, the difference between someone who works and then stops versus someone for whom work is an all-hours passion.  We have “day job” but that implies that it’s somehow not important, not the real you, whereas I have friends who love their jobs and are great at them but are still happy that the job ends when they clock out.  I like how voker/vocateur make clear that both kinds of relationship to one’s work are good and worthy of respect.\n\nAppealing to that passion/love/respect makes the word useful to discuss the opposite too:\n\n\u003e I think the word “vocateur” is an important one to have as a tool for discussing job exploitation, how so many jobs that people are willing to do for love become riddled with exploitative practices (teaching, research, writing, animation, social work...)[^1]\n\n[^1]: [Ada Palmer on Twitter, 12/25/19](https://twitter.com/Ada_Palmer/status/1209982918321414150)","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["lexicon"]},"/notes/vorfreude":{"title":"Vorfreude","content":"The German word vorfruede has no English equivalent.

Why does the existence of action carried out for the sheer pleasure of acting strike us as mysterious? What does it say about us that we  assume that it is?\n\nWe can’t reduce all living beings to rational, market actors. This tendency has been present since the 19th century beginnings of Darwinian science. Darwin, after all, borrowed the term “survival of the fittest” from the sociologist Herbert Spencer, that darling of robber barons–who was struck by how much the forces driving natural selection jibed with his own laissez-faire economic theories. \n\nCompetition over resources, rational calculation of advantage, and the gradual extinction of the weak were taken to be the prime directives of the universe. But why?\n\nAn alternative school of Darwinism emerged in Russia emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change. cf. [[books/mutual aid|Mutual Aid]] by Pyotr Kropotkin. It’s not just about cooperation as a means to an end though—Kropotkin posits that pleasure and play is an end in itself.\n\n## The origins of consciousness and free will \n\nFriedrich Schiller had already argued in 1795 that it was precisely in play that we find the origins of self-consciousness, and hence freedom, and hence morality.\n\nThis argument gets ignored, since cooperation for pleasure, as an end in itself, is difficult to recuperate for ideological purposes.\n\n## Is emergence enough?\n\n[[notes/emergence|Emergence]] is well and good, but is it enough to explain what’s going on? For example, if an electron is acting freely—if it, as Richard Feynman is supposed to have said, “does anything it likes”—it can only be acting freely as an end in itself. Which would mean that at the very foundations of physical reality, we encounter freedom for its own sake—which also means we encounter the most rudimentary form of play.\n\n## Play is not an anomaly\n\n\u003e What would happen if we proceeded from the reverse perspective and agreed to treat play not as some peculiar anomaly, but as our starting point, a principle already present not just in lobsters and indeed all living creatures, but also on every level where we find what physicists, chemists, and biologists refer to as “self-organizing systems”?\n\nThis gives us ground to unthink the world around us.\n\n## A famous Taoist story\n\nGraeber says when he taught at Yale, he would assign a reading of the following Taoist story, offering an automatic “A” to any student who could tell him why the last line made sense. (None ever succeeded.)\n\n\u003e Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on a bridge over the River Hao, when the former observed, “See how the minnows dart between the rocks! Such is the happiness of fishes.”\n\u003e “You not being a fish,” said Huizi, “how can you possibly know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “And you not being I,” said Zhuangzi, “how can you know that I don’t know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “If I, not being you, cannot know what you know,” replied Huizi, “does it not follow from that very fact that you, not being a fish, cannot know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “Let us go back,” said Zhuangzi, “to your original question. You asked me how I knew what makes fish happy. The very fact you asked shows that you knew I knew—as I did know, from my own feelings on this bridge.”\n\nThe anecdote is usually taken as a confrontation between two irreconcilable approaches to the world: the logician versus the mystic. But if that’s true, then why did Zhuangzi, who wrote it down, show himself to be defeated by his logician friend?\n\n\u003e After thinking about the story for years, it struck me that this was the entire point. By all accounts, Zhuangzi and Huizi were the best of friends. They liked to spend hours arguing like this. Surely, that was what Zhuangzi was really getting at. We can each understand what the other is feeling because, arguing about the fish, ==we are doing exactly what the fish are doing: having fun, doing something we do well for the sheer pleasure of doing it. Engaging in a form of play.== The very fact that you felt compelled to try to beat me in an argument, and were so happy to be able to do so, shows that the premise you were arguing must be false. Since if even philosophers are motivated primarily by such pleasures, by the exercise of their highest powers simply for the sake of doing so, then surely this is a principle that exists on every level of nature—which is why I could spontaneously identify it, too, in fish.\n\n## Stray notes\n\n- Debunks Richard Dawkins and The Selfish Gene, likewise Dennett\n- Jean-Paul Sartre at one point became erotically obsessed with lobsters after taking too much mescaline 🤣\n- Physicists are the poets of the scientific world (more playful and less hidebound creatures than, say, biologists— partly, no doubt, because they rarely have to contend with religious fundamentalists challenging the laws of physics)","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["pleasure-and-play","working-theories"]},"/notes/who-is-more-deserving":{"title":"Who is more deserving","content":"\n\u003e As if deserving meant anything.

At least he is not alone with it this time. Lan Qiren is furious, unable to outfox the brash young cultivator standing in the middle of the class, who is giving eloquent, textbook answers to every question, answering so swiftly and humbly that it almost feels like a mockery, like he could yawn his way through it the way he has most of the morning, idly doodling and dozing, except for the fact that something interesting is finally happening and he’s going to enjoy the moment the way he would unwrap a sweet.\n\nLan Wangji is there for appearances. He is supposed to sit straight-backed and disciplined, the perfect model of a student, the shining pinnacle of everything the Lan have to offer. *He* is supposed to swiftly and humbly recite the correct answer when a student falters like an untutored novice. *He* is not supposed to feel his heart race, his fingers curling in his sleeves, outdone by a careless, lazy flirt who aims his smile at Lan Wangji as precisely as an arrow, treating scholarly, serious subjects like a practice game of swords. \n\n*Wei Wuxian.* The name is made for clenched teeth, for outbursts of frustration. He must have been old enough to be like… *this,* already, when he was given the name. \n\nLan Wangji feels scant satisfaction when Lan Qiren does have to call on him. Scanter satisfaction still when the room erupts in shouts like someone kicked a hive of bees. Lan Qiren throws his scroll. Wei Wuxian expertly ducks. By then it’s all just one long buzz in Lan Wangji’s head, *improper cultivation, redirection not suppression,* Lan Wangji already bowing when Lan Qiren orders him to the library to administer Wei Wuxian’s punishment. \n\nIt’s what he had asked for the first night, hauling Wei Wuxian in and tossing him down on the carpet in front of the two elder Lan. Punishment, principles, they were all in place for a reason. They were not to be scoffed at, eyes going wide as the moon at the sheer number of them, brushed like dust off his long sleeves. \n\nThey will be written, at length, in detail, line by line, by the thousands, until Wei Wuxian’s hand is so crabbed he cannot ink a brush, willpower so broken that he will only ever speak politely when spoken to, the fire of his spirit so quenched that the grin falls off his face. It’s this image Lan Wangji cherishes, mentally painting it brushstroke by brushstroke, rendering it in loving detail as he hauls Wei Wuxian from a waterfall and plants him in the library. \n\nIt can take all summer, if it needs to. \n\nWei Wuxian will *learn.* \n\n---- \n\nWei Wuxian does not learn. \n\nLan Wangji, diligent in all of his duties, reports on his progress to Lan Xichen, and occasionally to their uncle himself, at the end of each week. A dozen copies transcribed. Five dozen. A hundred. “One hundred and forty-three,” he says this evening. Strictly speaking, it is one hundred and forty-two and a half, because he crumpled up the final pages and told Wei Wuxian to do them over when he had inked most of the margins with stick figures kissing. But Lan Wangji is generous. He *will* make Wei Wuxian finish those pages; he will also finesse that number slightly to his brother for the sake of expedience.\n\n*Do not be needlessly pedantic,* principle one-eighty-five. \n\nIt is only his brother he reports to tonight, who looks over the pages Lan Wangji has brought him (sans stick figures kissing), and remarks, “His calligraphy is not improving.”\n\n“Mn,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nLan Xichen suppresses a small smile. “Unlike his behavior in class. He has not caused a disruption in over a week. We have you to thank, Wangji.”\n\nLan Wangji purses his lips. They do. They have him to thank, because *now,* Wei Wuxian vibrates through class with all of his pent-up questions, unleashing the torrent on Lan Wangji as soon as they escape to the library, like a river flooding its banks. *Now,* Wei Wuxian directs a significant portion of his energy to the study and torment of Lan Wangji, fixating upon him like a particularly interesting specimen that he will pick apart with his fingers and consume piece by piece.\n\n*Do not be ungracious,* principle sixty-six. \n\n“—know it’s been a trial for you,” Lan Xichen is saying. “You’ve done well, but I will have a word with Uncle. There is no reason one of the outer disciples cannot watch over him instead.”\n\nLan Wangji feels a pulse of alarm. An *outer disciple,* in Wei Wuxian’s hands. “No,” he says sharply.\n\n“No?” \n\nLan Wangji lowers his gaze in respect. It lands on the sheaf of pages Lan Xichen holds, all the columns inked crookedly.[^1] “It would not…” He falters.\n\n“…be wise?” Lan Xichen finishes. “Ah. I suppose not. You are right. Still, you have better things to do with your time. You are gracious, Wangji.” \n\nNo. No, he is not. He is… irresponsible, and incautious, and he doesn’t know why it feels like he told a lie when he did not. The vast pit of unease that sits in his stomach and has not dissipated in weeks roils away in confusion. He has *done nothing wrong,* and yet it feels like Lan Qiren could level his sternest gaze and dictate his harshest punishment, and Lan Wangji would deserve it. Wei Wuxian has *done everything wrong,* and he breezes through his days, beams with delight when he’s scolded, naps like a cat in the sunlight, without a trace of guilty conscience. \n\n*Do good, and goodness follows*—principle twenty-eight.\n\nSomething is profoundly disordered. Lan Wangji is still sorting out *what* when he walks home at dusk, taking the long way around to do some sitting by the waterfall. He is so lost in thought that he almost stumbles, halting abruptly when he spots someone there first. \n\nWei Wuxian is sprawled on the rock, deeply engrossed in a book. *Outside of class*—a book. Reading. Lan Wangji has to rearrange the mental disarray this causes, more things not in their right place. Probably, it is—no, he can’t think of something unkind to charge him with. A book is a book—always good.[^2] Exactly which text it is, Lan Wangji can’t see, only that it’s not one of their textbooks. He glimpses an illustration.\n\nHis feet move of their own accord, drawing him over. Wei Wuxian jumps a mile, dropping the book and then scrambling after it. He sits upright, suddenly exhibiting the perfect posture that he has heretofore lacked, placing the book in his lap, folding his arms over it, offering Lan Wangji his most virtuous grin.\n\n“Lan Zhan!” he says brightly.\n\nLan Wangji reaches down for the book.\n\nWei Wuxian, bright red, yelps and slaps him away. He quickly sticks the book underneath him, sitting on it, pulling his skirts taut over his knees. \n\n“Do not treat a book that way,” Lan Wangji says ferociously.\n\n“Ha! Can if I want to. It’s mine, Lan Zhan.”\n\n“Yours.” \n\n“*Mine,*” he repeats. He looks around them, shifting his attention placidly onto the view. “So pretty here, Lan Zhan. Do you ever swim in the water? Bet it’s freezing. Bet there’s a rule.” He makes a face, dropping his voice into what is probably meant to be an imitation of Lan Qiren. “*Swimming is prohibited in Cloud Recesses.*” \n\nWei Wuxian knows there is no such rule—he would have copied it a hundred and forty-three times if there was. But, Lan Wangji concedes—there is only no rule because such a rule has not been necessary. Gusu Lan disciples do not grow up swimming like fish.\n\n“I don’t swim,” Lan Wangji says.\n\nWei Wuxian looks up, aghast. “Don’t, or *can’t?* How can you not swim, Lan Zhan? Did you just never learn? In Yunmeng we learn to swim before we can walk. I would’ve drowned if I couldn’t, all the times Jiang Cheng’s thrown me in the river.”\n\nLan Wangji, in this instance, can commiserate with Jiang Wanyin. “What did you do to deserve it?”\n\n“Ha! Ha-ha-ha. Lan Zhan, you’re so funny. Something bad happened to me, so of course I deserved it.” He is shaking his head. “I’d throw *you* in a river, Lan Zhan. Just for fun.”\n\nIt has happened again. Lan Wangji has been drawn into a conversation he had no intention of having. He has also been neatly sidetracked from the book—which he did not care about in the first place. He does the mental equivalent of rubbing his forehead, right where the pain throbs in his temple. \n\nWei Wuxian tidies his skirts, tucking them around his ankles, looking for all the world like he won’t move for the rest of the night. It reminds Lan Wangji of his purpose, the sitting and meditating he would like to be doing. “Curfew,” he says.\n\n“Curfew?” Wei Wuxian echoes, looking up at the sky that is still light against the mountain.\n\n“You are breaking it.” \n\n“Not yet.” \n\nLan Wangji’s fingers clench reflexively around Bichen.\n\n“It’s not dark yet, Lan Zhan. Anyone can see it’s not dark. Curfew is nightfall.”\n\n“It will be nightfall,” Lan Wangji points out pedantically, mentally apologizing for rule one-eighty-five, “by the time you reach your rooms.” \n\nWei Wuxian sulks. Then he goes still, tipping his head like he’s sighting a bird in a bush.\n\n“Bribery is prohibited,” Lan Wangji preempts him.\n\n“No, no no,” Wei Wuxian says, lost in thought. “It’s just that—Lan Zhan. That would mean *you’re* breaking curfew.” He taps his nose thoughtfully. “Why would the beautiful Second Young Master Lan be risking his spotless reputation to sneak off after curfew? Lan Zhan!” His eyes widen. He affects a conspiratorial grin of delight. “Do you have a… secret lover?”\n\n“Wei *Ying.*”\n\n“I know, I know, I know, I know. Secret. Is she pretty, Lan Zhan? Or… he?” Wei Wuxian frowns thoughtfully. “I’m trying to picture you kissing someone, Lan Zhan. Who would make you like them *that way?”* He makes a face over the failure of imagination he is apparently experiencing. \n\nLan Wangji is just standing there, breathing sharply.\n\n“I can’t picture it. Lan Zhan is so pretty. Who would be good enough for him? They would have to be noble of bearing, and pleasing in virtue, and the most beautiful cultivator in the land…” He shakes his head woefully, then brightens. “Maybe they will come soon, and I will see for myself!”\n\nLan Wangji actually—*actually*—makes a guttural sound of frustration. He has not done that since childhood.\n\n“I know, I know,” Wei Wuxian says again. He tilts his head at Lan Wangji in pained sympathy. “You are worried I will tell on you since you told on me. But I am not that kind of person, Lan Zhan.” He is devious, utterly devious, because he makes his dark eyes look genuinely wide with distress. “Are you worried, Lan Zhan? Would they punish you, for love? Are you going to have to write Conduct and Virtue one thousand times?”\n\n“Wei Ying,” he says, with deadly calm. \n\n“Lan Zhan, do not worry. I, your faithful friend Wei Ying, will stand by you to the end.” He lifts three fingers to his brow, which he holds for a moment before he splutters and tries to be solemn, but can’t and breaks into laughter. “Lan Zhan, the look on your face. I should paint it. I’d need lots of red ink—Lan Zhan!”\n\nLan Wangji, with dignity, has turned to walk away. He keeps walking. Not caring. Let him break curfew. Let him break so many rules he has to do penance on his knees. Tie him down to a desk, see if he obeys then, hobble his ankles, put a silence spell on that mouth—\n\nAnother guttural sound, no one to hear but the trees.\n\n----\n\nLan Wangji does not like being toyed with. For a week he makes Wei Wuxian suffer through his impassive silence. He doesn’t glare, nor does he sulk, nor does he pointedly direct his righteous fury that way. He simply goes about his business as though Wei Wuxian does not exist, even during their afternoons in the library. \n\nIt is more effective than anything Lan Wangji has done all summer. Wei Wuxian suffers. He teases, he dawdles, he does everything he can think of that should earn him a scolding. Lan Wangji reads, unaffected, or transcribes his own perfect texts, paying attention only to the brush and his sleeves. Wei Wuxian acts like it’s agony, like no one has ever been so cruel to him as this. There is a lot of showy drama. After several days, he seems truly distressed, even apologizing in a roundabout way where he doesn’t directly admit fault, bringing Lan Wangji offerings, mostly fruit, which Lan Wangji doesn’t touch, letting it attract flies.\n\nIt is late afternoon, a gray day with rain pattering lightly on the roof, when the impasse finally ends. Wei Wuxian is attempting his own silent treatment, and is actually copying lines; Lan Wangji is deeply absorbed in a poem by Li Bai.[^3] There is a line of such beauty—*peach blossoms flow downstream*—that Lan Wangji looks up to absorb it, the way he would if he was alone in his room. His eyes land on Wei Wuxian as if they wanted to rest there in the first place, and Wei Wuxian, mid-brush stroke, lifts his gaze. \n\nThe moment snags the way a petal would, caught in the eddy of a stream. Wei Wuxian looks at him, and then slowly, like the first pink of dawn spreading across the pearly gray sky, he smiles. A quiet, soft smile of irrepressible loveliness, followed by a slow, happy blink that says, *thank you, and sorry.* That says, *ah, there you are, you finally see me again.*\n\n----\n\nIt is the white robe, through the trees, that pulls Lan Wangji off the path. He does not know how he knows it’s Wei Wuxian—he just does. It is not where it should be, for one; for another, there is talking. The words grow distinct as Lan Wangji draws closer—they’re such nice bees, he’s saying, nice bees who wouldn’t want to ever sting anybody, especially anybody like him, who’s so nice too, and their friend, and just wants to taste some of this delicious honey they’ve made, the most delicious in the world. \n\n“A-Xian!” \n\nA bright, girlish laugh stops Lan Wangji’s heart. There is someone else with him, a second robe fluttering, which had been just out of sight. She stands on the ground; Wei Wuxian teeters above her, atop a large boulder, up to his elbows in the hollow trunk of a tree. \n\n“Careful! Here, take it,” Wei Wuxian calls out, crouching to pass her something with both hands.[^4]\n\nHe is clouded in—bees. Everywhere, bees. The girl below him, undaunted by the swarm, shows no fear for him, or for herself. \n\n“Shijie!” he scolds her. “Don’t drop it,” and Lan Wangji recognizes the purple sash and ribbons of Wei Wuxian’s sister. \n\n“We shouldn’t be here,” she’s saying, which matches, with relief, the assessment Lan Wangji had made of her character: polite and conscientious, immune to mischief, soft-spoken and well-mannered, someone who could not be more unrelated to Wei Wuxian. \n\nExcept here she is, working in easy tandem, used to such things. Taking honeycombs from him, and placing them in a basket hanging over her arm. \n\n“I asked Lan Zhan,” Wei Wuxian is saying. “It’s fine. He said so. Shijie, how much do you want?”\n\nLan Wangji does not clear his throat, nor does he speak. He merely places himself in the middle of the clearing and waits for the thieving pair to notice. It is satisfying when they do. Jiang Yanli startles, by the base of the tree, quickly saying, “Second Young Master Lan,” and dropping into a bow around the basket.\n\nWei Wuxian has the decency to turn pink. \n\nHe is where Lan Wangji places his steady gaze, since he is no doubt the instigator. Jiang Yanli is saying something about how gracious Second Young Master Lan is, to understand their request and grant them this privilege. \n\n“Mn,” Lan Wangji says, inclining his head slightly, since going along with the blatant lie is making Wei Wuxian squirm. \n\n“See! Shijie,” he says, laughing nervously, recovering his footing, literally and figuratively. “I told you Lan Zhan was kind, and not boring at all, and not the type of person who would be mean and not share nice things with his friends.” He is pressing his luck, watching to see how far Lan Wangji will go with him as he plays out this rope. \n\nLan Wangji is curious about that himself. “Mn,” he says again. \n\nThere is more to the chorus from Jiang Yanli, how thankful she is, how the Lan clan is so hospitable, how already she feels better and wishes to know if—\n\n“A-Jie!” A shout interrupts them from the foot of the hill. \n\n“Ah, that’s a-Cheng,” she says, throwing a look at Wei Wuxian. She looks pained, torn between loyalty, politeness, and duty. Fortunately, for Lan Wangji, these obligations are in harmony. “I don’t wish to rush off, but he will… if you’ll excuse me,” she says. Demurely, she bows to Lan Wangji again, holding it an extra moment of courtesy. “A-Xian…” She trades a communicative glance with her brother, then skirts politely around Lan Wangji, a safe distance away before she calls out, “A-Cheng, I’m here! We found it,” picking her way through the trees. \n\nWei Wuxian, still on the boulder, waits for her to go before he spreads his arms, swoops down across the short distance, and lands face to face with Lan Wangji. A few bees fly with him, circling them both, until they find nothing of interest and desultorily return to the swarm in the tree. \n\n“Stealing,” Lan Wangji says, refusing to take a step backwards to keep proper distance between them.\n\n“Not stealing.” Wei Wuxian holds up two bare forearms, sleeves rolled up past his elbows. He shows Lan Wangji, front and back. A few scratches have raised faint little dotted ribbons of blood to the surface of his skin. No stings. “I asked nicely. The nice bees said yes. Didn’t hurt me. And it’s *their* honey, not yours.”\n\n“Lying.” Lan Wangji continues his list. \n\n“Only so shijie wouldn’t feel bad. And I *did* try to find you! Not my fault you hide from me all the time.” Another lie, and a glimmer of pleasure in telling it. Wei Wuxian’s eyes are warm brown at this distance, like rosewood polished to a gleam. \n\nLan Wangji holds his gaze. “Indecent attire.”\n\n“Fine, fine fine,” Wei Wuxian says, finally hearing a crime he’ll admit to. He flaps his arms in a shrug. “Bare skin! It’s so scandalous. Lan Zhan will maul me before we’re even out of the forest! My virtue will never recover.” He reaches to untie his sleeves and realizes his hands are sticky with honey, and tree bark, and a good deal of dirt. He shrugs again, dropping his arms sheepishly. \n\nLan Wangji makes a calculation. He turns and starts walking. \n\n“Lan Zhan—what the—” Wei Wuxian huffs. Lan Wangji does not look back. He knows the way through the trees; when he stops, Wei Wuxian has trailed after him warily, and stops too, a short distance away. \n\nLan Wangji waits for him to see it. When he does, his eyes widen a fraction, then narrow and stare at Lan Wangji askance. Begrudgingly, he crouches down to start scrubbing his hands in the trickling spring. \n\nIt is quiet a moment. They are away from the bees. The trees shift in the mild breeze; the water laughs on the rocks. \n\n“Shijie gets headaches,” Wei Wuxian says presently, his wrists red from the water, which pours from the rock cold and clear as ice. He is still scrubbing, not looking up. “Bad ones, sometimes. And fevers. It’s always worse when it rains, like it has all week.”\n\nIt is sudden, the change in his voice, stripped of all guile, leaving only sincerity. Lan Wangji says nothing, which Wei Wuxian interprets—as always—as a request to continue. \n\n“So bad sometimes that even the light hurts,” he says. “There’s not much that helps, but it was very bad the other day, so I went to Wen Qing for medicines.” He makes a face. “You should taste it, Lan Zhan. It’s the worst thing I’ve tasted, worse than your bitter tonic soup. At home we’d have wild honey, you know, to make bad things taste better. So I guess I talked about it a lot, which made us both homesick, which made shijie feel worse so I had to make her feel better. I told her, shijie, surely there is wild honey around. Your beloved brother Wei Ying will find it. And I did.”\n\nHe stands up, shaking his hands dry. Lan Wangji realizes with startling clarity that it is easy to tell when Wei Wuxian is telling the truth. He drops the lies, playful or otherwise, the way someone would lower a sword and leave themselves unguarded. \n\n“She would have been so embarrassed if you caught us,” Wei Wuxian continues. “If I hadn’t asked you permission. So thank you, Lan Zhan.” After a moment, he adds contritely, “I can write more lines if I need to.”\n\nThe woods are dappled with sunlight at this hour of the day. Wei Wuxian still has not rolled down his sleeves. His hands are brown from the sun, as are his arms, up to his elbows. There is no line where pale skin starts, the telltale sign of how often his sleeves are not where they should be.\n\nLan Wangji knows the trick of averting his gaze when his eyes speak too much. He employs it now, just like he had employed it a moment ago to avoid Wei Wuxian’s eyes when they were being honest and dangerous. “No,” he says. \n\n“No?”\n\n“More lines. There is no need.”\n\n“Oh,” says Wei Wuxian uncertainly, like bait he has dangled has been ignored by the fish. “Ah! Well, that’s good then.” \n\n“Mn,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nAfter a moment, he turns to walk away. Wei Wuxian falls in alongside him, stepping close as they pass through a narrow gap in the trees. He unrolls his sleeves, which fall around him and flutter like cabbage moths in the garden.[^5]\n\n“I guess it’s good then, back there, that I didn’t offer you honeycombs. I would have,” he says. “If it was just up to me. But I thought Lan Zhan would say, *bribery is prohibited.* Principle two-thirty-eight.”\n\nHe pauses to see if Lan Wangji will respond to this.\n\n“I’d have to copy a thousand more texts,” Wei Wuxian says faithfully. “Die of old age in the library. Hundreds of years from now, your Lan disciples would say what’s that in the corner? And you’d say, that’s Wei Ying, a pile of dust, because he gave Lan Wangji honeycombs…”\n\n“How do you not get stung?” Lan Wangji blurts abruptly. \n\n“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says, withdrawing the arm he had jovially bumped against Lan Wangji’s sleeve. “Oh, that? Bees are nice, like I said.” He waves it off. “If you’re calm, they’re calm too. Have you ever been stung? You might have made them mad, or scared them. That stern face of yours, Lan Zhan. That would do it. As long as they aren’t hurt or scared, they’re just happy little bees, buzzing around. I can show you—Lan Zhan.”\n\nWei Wuxian collides with him, this time because Lan Wangji has stopped in the middle of sun-dappled greenery. Wei Wuxian looks at him, miffed. \n\n“Butterbur,” Lan Wangji says.[^6]\n\n“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says. He is smart, so Lan Wangji waits for him to make the leap between the word and the leafy foliage at their feet. “Ah,” he says, when he does. “Butterbur. For… what?” \n\n“Headaches.”\n\nWei Wuxian looks at him a long time. “Oh,” he says finally, sounding lost, even though they are now only a stone’s throw from the path. He trails his gaze down again, looking around them, the sea of giant, cup-shaped, almost lotus-like leaves. \n\n“Dry the roots, or boil the leaves. Drink the tea,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nWei Wuxian scratches his elbow, looking supremely uncomfortable. “Thanks?” he says. “Lan Zhan? Can you please not do this again?”\n\nLan Wangji frowns. \n\n“It’s much more fun when I do something and you say, *ridiculous.* Or try to get me in trouble. I don’t know what to *do* with you when you’re like this, all—” He makes a helpless sound of distaste, gesturing up and down at Lan Wangji’s person. \n\nLan Wangji frowns longer, then turns to walk away. Wei Wuxian skips around him, circling in front of him, grabbing his arm. \n\n“See! That’s much better! Now get mad, say something mean, call me names—”\n\n“Let go,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nWei Wuxian drops his hand immediately. He steps backwards, which means he stumbles, and catches himself, and bumps against a tree. \n\n“Ow,” he says. \n\nLan Wangji traps him there, stepping closer. Wei Wuxian goes still, like a deer who knows instinctively he has been sighted as prey.\n\n“Lan Zhan,” he says, and laughs nervously. Just a soft, shaky *ha,* otherwise perfectly willing, Lan Wangji notices, to be pinned against a tree.[^7] He watches as Wei Wuxian swallows, the knot sliding up and down the line of his throat.\n\nIt’s too late. He’s too close. He has made a grave miscalculation. He cannot think past the soft shape of Wei Wuxian’s mouth. \n\nDesire splits him open, like an unpruned sapling too green to carry summer’s ripe fruit.[^8] He is trembling with want. He wants to—he doesn’t even *know enough* to know exactly all the things that he wants, a lack of knowledge that fills him with violent frustration. He wants to *kiss him.* Pale words for what he wants to do. He wants to maul him, bite him, lick him like the honey he hasn’t been given; bruise him like overripe fruit. He wants Wei Wuxian’s hands on him, grasping, Wei Wuxian *kissing him back.* He would need to pin his wrists then, grip his hips, do whatever it takes to wrest back control, hold on to some frayed scrap of his dignity even as the kiss grows longer, and—and gentler, and deeper, and—\n\nScalded, Lan Wangji takes a step back. Wei Wuxian sways forward, like they’re tethered, reaching after him without thinking before they both freeze in unison, one step apart, staring. Wei Wuxian looks addled, like the surface of a pond where someone has just chucked in a stone.\n\nLan Wangji desperately wants to hear footsteps coming up the path. Something that will pull them apart; a flock of encroaching disciples, even ones who whisper *jade princess,* cast sly looks at Wei Wuxian and stifle giggles in class.\n\nNothing happens. No rescue comes. Lan Wangji blinks; Wei Wuxian frowns. Lan Wangji blinks again, giving his head a brief shake to clear it. “Wei Ying,” he says. His gaze resting on the blue and white collar at the base of his throat. \n\nSomething moves. Wei Wuxian looks down. Carefully, haltingly, he parts the top layers of his robe. The little yellow bee, hidden there, flicks her wings, scrubs her legs. Wei Wuxian lifts her out, coaxing her onto the tip of his finger.[^9] The bee perches there for a moment, Wei Wuxian’s eyes going wide and delighted, almost crossing over each other in order to peer at her more closely. Another elegant flick of her wings, and she takes flight, looping over their heads, finally zagging sharply off towards the nearest patch of blossoms.\n\nWei Wuxian’s laughter is soft and carefree, eyes shining, no longer the least bit off balance. He grins at Lan Wangji and recites, “Never hurt insects or plants,” the eleventh Lan principle. \n\n“I—” Lan Wangji says, and fights back the words. \n\n“Me too,” Wei Wuxian says, which shows he has no idea what Lan Wangji was going to say. Lan Wangji doesn’t know either, except it wasn’t anything that would have Wei Wuxian saying, “Shijie will think I’ve gotten lost in the woods,” and tucking his robes tight together, skipping the short distance down to the path that winds its way down the mountain. \n\nThen he darts back up, sheepishly grinning as he plucks a few stalks of butterbur, wriggling them loose from the earth so the plugs of roots come up with them. \n\n“Coming, Lan Zhan?” he calls from below, once he is back on the path. \n\nLan Wangji shakes his head curtly. Wei Wuxian tosses him a wave and that bright, undaunted smile, and whistles a little as he wanders away.\n\n----\n\nIn the cold springs, Lan Wangji doesn’t remove his robes. He sits with the water up to his shoulders, his submerged posture impeccable. His fingers have gone numb by the time they shrivel into prunes. \n\n“Wangji.” A polite cough. “Wangji? …Wangji.”\n\nLan Wangji looks up and blinks. He is not sure how long his brother has been sitting there, bare-shouldered, the tail of his ribbons floating in the water. It seems like maybe a while. He looks amused. \n\n“I said, your lips are blue,” Lan Xichen says gently. \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, rising, reaching for his robe to pull around him—which he is already wearing. He climbs out of the pool, trailing water. It follows him up the path, along with the sound that is either Lan Xichen’s soft laughter or the wind in the trees. \n\n----\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, to everything.\n\nIt becomes the pattern of his days. No to Wei Wuxian, who bounces up alongside him with schemes or smiles, or loquats, or warmth he pours out like cups of Lan Wangji’s favorite tea. No to Lan Xichen (who has acquired the untimely habit of saying *yes*). No to company, while hunting water ghosts. No to absurd, clever theories. No to the half dozen flirtations he has to fend off before noon. No so exhaustively, so reflexively, so nonsensically, that Wei Wuxian makes it a game, counting it as a victory when he can get Lan Wangji to say anything else.\n\nLan Wangji *would* say something else if he knew what to do; if he knew how else to survive this. \n\nHe reaches the ends of his days sweaty with exhaustion. There is no one he can turn to. Uncle—his mind balks. The last place to breathe any words that could connect back to Wei Wuxian is in Lan Qiren’s presence. His brother is no longer a refuge. Even if Lan Wangji were to present his dilemma in hypothetical form, all identifying details removed, Lan Xichen would just smile indulgently, nod sagely, and murmur unhelpful encouragement about cultivating friendships. Lan Wangji loves his brother, but—*honestly.* \n\nEven books fail him. The poets have two poles on the subject: infatuation, and heartbreak. The books of wisdom offer the same word Lan Wangji already has: *no,* but with nothing else helpful like *how.* Any texts with illustrations give him heart palpitations. He approaches blue covers now the way he would approach a snake in the grass. \n\nIronically, miserably, it’s in Wei Wuxian’s presence where he feels like he would have a confidant. Wei Wuxian is undaunted by anything. He would put his clever mind to it, and be kind like with his sister—no. Not on this matter. On this matter he would crow with delight and—probably climb in Lan Wangji’s lap, exhibit *no restraint*—\n\nLan Wangji is sweaty again. He devotes every spare minute to more cultivation. Even Lan Xichen grows concerned, tells him—*lies to him*—that it’s not a crime nor a sin to enjoy himself. A boy his age, he’s allowed to not be so strict on himself all the time. Pleasure, fun—these are words Lan Xichen uses, a foreign language that Lan Wangji is suddenly expected to know. \n\nMore expectations placed on him. He is aware that even the most sturdy bow snaps under ill-applied pressure, strung with too tight a string. \n\nHe is not a bow, though. Nor a boy. He is—he is *Lan.* \n\nAnd he is lost. \n\n---- \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, when there’s liquor. \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, when he’s drunk. \n\n“No,” he says wildly, panicked, when Wei Wuxian—also drunk—is just going to crawl in bed beside him, yawning. \n\n“No,” he says, more painfully, softly, when Wei Wuxian tries to leave. \n\n“Lan Zhan, I have never known anybody more ridiculous than you are,” Wei Wuxian grumbles, but then does what he always does, finds the space between those two *no’s* and folds himself back down to sit on the floor by the bed.\n\nHe unties his sash, his outer robe, getting comfortable. He flings the sash away in the same motion that Lan Wangji bolts upright. \n\n“Lan Zhan! *Calm down.*” Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes. “You can have one or the other. You can have the bed, or you can have me fully dressed. Can’t have both.”\n\nHe takes a swig from the jar, missing half of it with his mouth, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, which distracts Lan Wangji temporarily from the discarded sash. Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes again, placing both hands on Lan Wangji’s shoulders to ease him back down on the bed. \n\n“See? More comfortable. Yes?” Wei Wuxian says in the patient way people speak to small children. He perches his chin on his hand, observing Lan Wangji for a moment. “Are you going to sleep now? Or call me Wei-gege again?”\n\nLan Wangji’s ears blaze with heat. He can keep the color off his face if he stares up at the ceiling.\n\n“Hmm,” Wei Wuxian muses. “Not harsh, but refreshing. Soft, yet full bodied. Mature and fragrant.” His eyes widen, happy to put on a display of innocence when Lan Wangji turns to look at him. “Describing the liquor, Lan Zhan. You’re supposed to do that when you drink. All the poets do it.”\n\nLan Wangji’s description would be *vile.* He keeps that thought to himself, returning to stare unblinking at the ceiling. He can sense instead of see the face Wei Wuxian makes—his *Lan Zhan is so boring* face, a fact they’ve well established—but he is silent for a moment, which gives Lan Wangji’s question the chance to come tumbling out. “What else does one do when one drinks?”\n\n*Fun,* Lan Xichen’s word, the language he is supposed to be learning. One might as well ask an expert. \n\n“Well,” Wei Wuxian says, taking it seriously. “Dumb stuff. Laugh a lot—things are funnier when you’re drunk. One time Jiang Cheng dared me to steal a boat, and I did, but it leaked, and we sank.” He grins to himself, basking in the memory, then shrugs with one shoulder. “You just play around. Do what you want. Tease the boy you like.”\n\nLan Wangji cuts his eyes at him. \n\n“Kiss the boy you like.” Wei Wuxian takes a small sip of liquor. \n\nLan Wangji feels the same jolt as when he walked in the room, the sudden little violent reaction at finding Wei Wuxian piled beneath the boys on the bed. Is this what he does when he drinks? Lose all inhibitions, let *someone else*—\n\n“Lan Zhan?” Wei Wuxian says, amused. \n\nThe silence has gone on too long. It is telling, because Wei Wuxian has set aside the jar and folded his arms on the bed, regarding Lan Wangji with interest. \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nThe familiar response makes a smile bloom on Wei Wuxian’s face, warm and just as familiar.\n\n“Okay. Lan Zhan? Because you could,” he says patiently. “Kiss me, I mean. Just as friends. I wouldn’t mind. I would—”\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says. It doesn’t sound like his voice. \n\nWei Wuxian scoots up a little, propping up on his elbows. Lan Wangji, taken leave of all of his senses, responds without thinking, raising up on one arm to meet him. \n\nWei Wuxian looks into his eyes. That lasts for several long moments. Then he is frowning, saying, “Just a little…” and tipping Lan Wangji’s head for him. Lan Wangji has already done something wrong, not known how to fit—with their noses. Even drunk, he is lost, all the way outside the bounds of his meagre experience, unable to know what any sensible person would know how to do—\n\nThe kiss happens then. Neatly, chastely. Lips are pressed against his. It is—dry, a little strange. Lan Wangji feels detached, unsure if he’s missed an important instruction. There is no precedent for it. *This is kissing,* occurs in the back of his mind. \n\nWei Wuxian opens his eyes, pulling back. He looks—not *disappointed,* but doubtful. Lan Wangji has doubts too. He also has vast experience of the look on Wei Wuxian’s face when he sets his formidable mind against an unforeseen complication. Lan Wangji meets him partway that time, when Wei Wuxian leans back in. \n\nBetter. Still chaste, still dry lips against lips, but Wei Wuxian has softened his mouth. Lan Wangji does the same, never one to let someone outmatch him. A string of soft kisses then, two, three, four, each one polite and studious. Lan Wangji makes a sound of dissatisfaction. \n\nWei Wuxian shuffles up closer. He licks his lips, places his hand boldly on Lan Wangji’s chest, leans in and delivers what the kiss has been missing. \n\nThis time it—*oh.* Lan Wangji’s lips part. He lifts up, chasing the kiss, a change of angle, and pressure—their lips slot together. It is wet now, and warm—an impossibly soft, silky heat that snags on his lips and spills down through him the way the liquor had done. *Kissing,* it’s—a little breathless, like drowning, or flying. Wei Wuxian climbs up closer; Lan Wangji’s hand slides around the nape of his neck. They both make a small sound at that, startled. The kiss grows more clumsy, more pressing, Wei Wuxian the one learning places his hands can go. \n\nIt’s—they pull apart. They pant a little, hands stuck in each others’ hair. \n\n“I didn’t—!” Wei Wuxian protests, letting him go with an alacrity that makes Lan Wangji’s heart give a hard painful kick, until he realizes Wei Wuxian is staring at his ribbon, askew across his forehead.\n\n“Ridiculous,” Lan Wangji says hoarsely, and pulls him back in.\n\nThe kiss changes that time, again. Wei Wuxian is almost in his arms, and it makes awareness slide through them, of what exactly they’re doing. The kiss deepens, and slips, and then—Lan Wangji doesn’t even know quite how it happens. They’re still kissing—his hand on Wei Wuxian’s chest—but each kiss recedes, one by one. Like the tide going out. Safer kisses, softer kisses, circling around and arriving back at the polite, uncertain beginning. Lan Wangji lets him go, his hands empty when the last kiss breaks apart. \n\n“Ah,” Wei Wuxian says, and clears his throat. “Lan Zhan, that was…” He smiles a little, and rallies. “That wasn’t bad. That was good.” He pats Lan Wangji’s chest, job well done, and musters a different smile for him, cheerful and obliging. He looks mussed and—well-kissed, and unspeakably lovely, silver hairpiece askew, outer robe slipping down off his shoulder, his lower lip red where Lan Wangji bit and tugged it at the end. \n\n“Ah, you can—you can forget all about this in the morning,” Wei Wuxian says reassuringly, patting his chest again. “Never happened. I mean, I’ll probably remember a little, just because it was… and you’re…” Lan Wangji dies a little when he doesn’t finish that sentence. “But I wouldn’t ever—just two friends, drinking. Wouldn’t ever make you lose face. Promise, Lan Zhan. We don’t ever have to talk about it again.”\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, but the sound doesn’t quite come out. Wei Wuxian slips away, off the mat, bedding himself down on the floor. His head appears again, too abruptly. \n\n“*Aren’t* we friends now?” \n\nLan Wangji, who is flat on his back again, staring fixedly at the ceiling, shakes his head. \n\nWei Wuxian sighs. “Think we *are,*” he mumbles under his breath. “Gave you my bed. Got you drunk. Had fun. Talked.” He sounds like he is counting on his fingers as he rattles this off, perversely leaving off *kissed.* “I do so much for you, Lan Zhan, and you don’t even say, ‘Wei Ying, here, you’re so generous, you should have half of the bed, which is yours in the first place, I would not be so rude—’”\n\n“No.” Lan Wangji finally manages to get the word out. \n\n“*Fine.*” Wei Wuxian grunts, sounding suspiciously like he is grinning all over. There is too much noise as he shuffles around, fumbling and settling and trying to get comfortable.\n\nAnd then there is too much quiet. \n\nHis head pops up again. “Hey, Lan Zhan, I have books! Sometimes I read, when I can’t sleep—”\n\n“*No,*” Lan Wangji says, so forcefully that there is no doubt this time about Wei Wuxian’s grin. He beams at him, draping his arm across the foot of the bed, the position in which he has apparently decided to sleep. \n\n“Whatever,” he says blithely, poking Lan Wangji’s ankle before he closes his eyes. “Just don’t complain at me in the morning, when you haven’t slept and have a headache so bad you can’t open your eyes, because you didn’t take my advice, and then everybody says, what’s wrong with Lan Zhan, usually he’s so mean but now he just looks adorable, I feel sorry for him, I think he must actually be a very nice person…”\n\n----\n\nIt’s almost alarming, in hindsight, how little anything changes. \n\nLan Wangji wakes up the next morning—Wei Wuxian doubled over laughing, trying to shake him awake, pull him up off the *floor*—mortification scalding the entire surface of Lan Wangji’s skin—but none of it forces a reckoning, nor a major point of departure, nor a fork in the road from which he is unable to return.\n\nAll of that happened weeks ago—*months*. That’s the truth that dawns on him throughout the course of the day. He has already discovered so much new terrain in himself that he just… feels like himself. A little bitchy, a little terrified; miserable with longing and unrepentant and still utterly lost as to what he will do. \n\nWei Wuxian doesn’t go anywhere. He squawks in protest at their punishment; he chases Lan Wangji through the cold springs. He is just like himself too, infuriating and loyal and—oddly quiet, robes dripping, watching Lan Wangji tie his ribbon around their wrists. \n\n*That* should feel strange, at least. New. A fundamental shift between them. Instead, it feels like it has all summer, a fate that has stuck them together, half-wedded, half-doomed. \n\nNone of it can last. This Lan Wangji knows. There is no future for them with Wei Wuxian happily ensconced at his side. He does not belong here, with three thousand rules and bitter soup served at mealtimes and the sour-faced, severe Second Jade who takes it as courtesy when his personality is described as merely aloof. \n\nThis boy who calls his sword *Whatever.* This young man of grace, mischief, and beauty, too wild-hearted for the Gusu Lan to contain.\n\nLan Wangji knows all of this, and still it slides into his heart like a blade, Wei Wuxian painting lanterns, pledging words about duty and justice, wishing to have a clear conscience all the days of his life. \n\nAnd that—*that* feels like a turning point. A thousand tiny fires trapped inside him,[^10] lifting up like the lanterns away from the mountain, into the sky.\n\n----\n[[private/cql/2 - xuanwu cave|Next - Xuanwu Cave]]\n\n\n[^1]: My first departure from TV canon, since it shows perfectly inked pages when WWX wakes up under his homework (ep 3).

Trapped in a cave. At the time, it doesn’t feel like those seven days could determine the course of his life, or Wei Wuxian’s. \n\nAnd yet. \n\n---- \n\nLan Wangji wakes up to the sound of exertion. \n\nIt has scarcely been a day; already he has learned that any sound in the cave is less alarming than silence. His leg keeps finding new ways to ache, which means he’s kept trying new ways to slip past the pain—dozing, mostly, outside of his habitual sleeping hours, or meditation so deep it might as well be unconsciousness. Wei Wuxian scolds him, saying how are they supposed to count the days if Lan Wangji sleeps at all hours, *so undisciplined, really,* and still it’s easy to slip in and out of consciousness, his body overtaxed and more broken than it has been in a while. \n\nThat is one thing he’s woken up to, the scolding. There was also the snapping of twigs, Wei Wuxian yelping when he pinched a finger while feeding the fire. There was what first felt like silence—but turned out to be the faint sound of water, Wei Wuxian coming up out of the pool to bring back a new layer of robes that he would have to spread out and dry. \n\nThe actual silence, in which Lan Wangji basked for a single, decadent moment before he opened his eyes, had been Wei Wuxian an inch from his face, feathering a maple leaf over Lan Wangji’s skin. Wei Wuxian yelled and fell backwards, and then scolded Lan Wangji for so long that, eventually, the scolding helped calm the way Lan Wangji’s heart was trying to pound out of his chest.\n\nSo, the sound of exertion: a welcome thing. It gives Lan Wangji time to greet the pain in his leg, and to gather himself for the sight that awaits him. \n\nWei Wuxian, on the other side of the fire, carefully moves through sword drills, testing his injured shoulder. \n\nHe’s wearing the red inner robe, half-dry and streaked with the same dirt and soot that streaks his hands and his face. The sword, salvaged from a fallen Wen soldier, has no spiritual power behind it; it’s different from the way he wields Suibian with effortless grace. But he is still—Lan Wangji has the strength to admit this—an exceptionally skilled swordsman, an elegance and intensity to his movements that is arresting to watch. There is a kind of grace, Lan Wangji thinks, that is no less striking for the effort. Wei Wuxian wipes the hair out of his eyes and goes through the same drills again, and again, finally sheathing the sword with a grin of boundless delight when he catches Lan Wangji watching him. \n\n“You’re awake!” he says, dropping down beside Lan Wangji to poke at the fire. “I’m getting better. My shoulder.” He exhibits this range of motion, then rubs at his chest, wincing slightly. “Not that it really hurts but it’s good to keep stretching it out, make sure it heals properly. Shijie would make me eat lots of protein if I was at home, so my stomach keeps growling. Have you ever had lung fung soup? No, I guess not. It’s a Yunmeng dish. Or pork rib and lotus root? Nobody makes it like shijie. I’d get injured just to have it, it’s that good.” He rubs his stomach with a look of distress and longing. “I don’t know what’s worse, to think about food or to not think about it. How’s your leg, with the medicine? I’ll be ready to fight Xuanwu like we planned when you’re ready.”\n\nLan Wangji has followed this stream of talk the way he follows most things out of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, with effort and partial success. “Mn,” he answers, to the one question he deems relevant.\n\n“Good,” Wei Wuxian says sincerely. “It’s from Wen Qing, so I knew it would help. You’ll feel better, Lan Zhan, and then we’ll fight Xuanwu, and if I die you have to tell everyone how brave I was.” \n\nHe’s teasing. He flashes a smile so brilliant and full of life it says *how could I ever die?*\n\nLan Wangji, knowing better than to argue, says, “Mn.”\n\n“I want at least three songs written about me,” Wei Wuxian requests. “Make sure they mention my beauty, not just how strong and fearless I am. You don’t have to lie about it—I’m modest too. Just say I was half as beautiful as the Second Jade of Lan, that makes me twice as beautiful as anyone else.”\n\nLan Wangji, through much experience, knows a ploy when he sees one. He is being provoked, into a scowl or a scoff or—Wei Wuxian probably hopes—the elusive eye roll. He refuses to rise to the bait. \n\n“That’s why you can’t die first,” Wei Wuxian is saying. “I’m good at music, but you’re better. Okay?”\n\n“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says, since the edge of his robe is dangling in the fire he’s just stoked. \n\n“Oh,” Wei Wuxian says, patting out the stray sparks, tucking the robe safely beneath him. He doesn’t say thanks, but he nods, and then he bends down to check on Lan Wangji’s leg in the newly bright light. \n\n---- \n\nLan Wangji is learning this about himself: he has had enough of caves for a lifetime. \n\nWei Wuxian, for all of his self-professed boredom, appears to share none of this sentiment. He explores the cave with enthusiasm, wandering off and returning to their circle of light, faithfully reporting each finding in exhaustive detail, at length, often already mid-sentence by the time he returns to Lan Wangji by the fire.\n\nThere is a shallow pool in this chamber. There are no signs of fish; there might be snakes, he’ll keep looking. There are definitely bats, which means the water is not safe to drink—a fact he dwells on less than he does the squeaks and flaps of the little bats, so *cute,* Lan Zhan. \n\nThere is plenty of firewood. There is no sign of an exit. The bodies are gone, which makes Lan Wangji’s eyes widen, even as Wei Wuxian decides this bodes well for them. If Xuanwu stuffs himself, he won’t need them as a meal. “I bet he’s just hungry, Lan Zhan. *You’d* be pissed off too if you’d gone hundreds of years without a good snack.” It’s only the second day of their fast, but this is close enough to the truth that Lan Wangji can’t dismiss it. \n\nThis bodes well too: there *is* water. The Wen soldiers dropped flasks as they fled or fell, and Wei Wuxian gathers an armful, enough to last three or four days, more if they ration it strictly. There is medicine too—Wei Wuxian shakes him awake over that one, an incoherent story about a bottle that he’d lost and thought was gone but then finally found. Blearily, Lan Wangji accepts the two pills Wei Wuxian drops on his tongue, dutifully coughing them down with a sip of stale water. Wei Wuxian brushes his chin, then swallows one pill for himself. \n\n“—our cores,” Wei Wuxian is saying, something about the nourishment thereof. It’s not food, nor is it enough to fully quench the pain or the thirst, but after a while, Lan Wangji feels as if he could keep his eyes open for more than an hour at a time. The pain recedes slightly. It feels like pale spring sunlight inside him; not a surge of energy, but a glimmer—a hope.\n\n“Knew Wen Qing could help us,” Wei Wuxian says happily, and performs another small miracle: for the first time in two days, he closes his eyes and his mouth, allowing them both a few moments of rest. \n\n---- \n\n“Have you ever broken a bone? Before this time, I mean.”\n\nLater that day, or the next. Time bleeds like the wound on Lan Wangji’s leg before it had clotted. Wei Wuxian claims to keep track, but then again he has claimed it would take only two days for rescue, forgetting their rescuers have no swords to maneuver. Or maybe he does remember, but won’t say anything, chastened from when he’d already stumbled over the fact that help won’t be forthcoming from Cloud Recesses. Perhaps they are both politely keeping up fictions. Lan Wangji, trying to discipline his mind away from worst-case scenarios, has found that to his dismay the constant chatter helps. \n\n“Mn,” he says, which Wei Wuxian interprets correctly as *no.*\n\n“Really? Not ever?” He is lying on his back, one arm folded beneath his head, idly twirling a stick through his fingertips. “I have, lots. It’s not so bad, once you get used to it.”\n\nLan Wangji cannot conceive of *getting used to* the kind of pain in his leg. He bears it, he ignores it when necessary, but the pain touches a deep core of anger inside him, something that cannot stand to suffer injustice. \n\n“I climbed lots of trees,” Wei Wuxian is explaining. “I’d sleep up there, then fall and break my arm. Once it was because Jiang Cheng threw me off a pier.”\n\nLan Wangji tries to conceive of that too, a brother who shows his affection with aggression. Picturing Lan Xichen throwing him off a pier, he might as well picture Lan Xichen cutting off his head. \n\n“I’ve gotten burned before too.” Wei Wuxian starts to hike up his skirt, then thinks better of it, dropping the fabric back down over, presumably, whatever scar lurks beneath. “I was old enough to know better, but shijie’s soup smelled so good, I tried to climb up to reach it and knocked the pot off the stove.”\n\n*Old enough to know better should apply to everything that you do,* Lan Wangji refrains from saying. See, he can do politeness, and fictions. \n\n“Once,” he says, and then pauses.\n\nWei Wuxian, sometimes, knows when to wait out the pauses. He twirls the stick through a complicated series of loops, both of them watching his fingers. \n\n“Once,” Lan Wangji says again. “I slipped. With Bichen. I had only just begun training. It took weeks to heal.”\n\n“Ooh, Lan Zhan.” Wei Wuxian flips over to face him, eyes bright with interest. “You do have scars.”\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says illogically. \n\n“No? It didn’t scar? Do you have secret medicines known only to the Lan?”\n\nWhat Lan Wangji had meant was, *no, I won’t show you,* only to realize he hadn’t been asked. He blushes in the firelight that is too dim to show blushes.\n\n“No,” he says again. \n\n“No secret medicines? Oh.” Wei Wuxian looks disappointed. Then he brightens. “That means you *do* have scars, though. You’re a man, Lan Zhan.”\n\n*Manhood* does not constitute *scarring,* but Lan Wangji doesn’t feel like revisiting the headache of heroic gestures and pretty girls. “It was an accident,” he says in clipped tones. \n\n“Of course it was, but you don’t *tell* people that. You make up a good story. One where you’re brave and the hero.”\n\nLan Wangji tries to resist. He really does try to resist. “Like falling out of trees, or being thrown off a pier?”\n\nWei Wuxian’s face lights up the way only his face lights up when a worthy opponent bests him. “Ha!” he says. “Exactly. Or knocking pots off a stove.”\n\nHe is grinning, and waiting to see if Lan Wangji will join him. When he doesn’t, Wei Wuxian laughs, undaunted, and rolls back over to resume tossing the stick in the air. \n\n---- \n\n“It’s so boring. I’m so bored,” Wei Wuxian says for the third time that hour, as if this is Lan Wangji’s fault. \n\nThe third day. Lan Wangji is reasonably sure of this, if only because of the hollow pains in his stomach, and the fact his leg can bear some weight. Wei Wuxian, sitting next to him, is tossing pebbles at a stick he’s stuck in the ground. He slumps halfway over, then pouts when this too fails to get Lan Wangji’s attention.\n\n“Lan Zhan,” he says. \n\nLan Wangji, who has been trying to meditate—albeit with modifications, as his leg doesn’t allow for his preferred lotus pose—chooses the one response that is sure to provoke Wei Wuxian. Silence. \n\n“Lan Zhan?” A pebble clicks. “Lan Zhan.”\n\nLan Wangji waits for one more *Lan Zhan,* the one that stretches the last syllable into a whine, before he opens his eyes. \n\n“Do you do this a lot?” Wei Wuxian asks, indicating Lan Wangji’s state of interrupted serenity, as if this was the urgent question that just had to be asked. \n\nLan Wangji looks at him. \n\n“You do, don’t you? Like for days at a time, by yourself?”\n\n“Self-discipline is good for proper cultivation.”\n\nWei Wuxian screws up his face, disapproval mixed with contemplation. \n\n“Don’t you meditate?” Lan Wangji asks, afraid to hear the answer. \n\n“Of course. Once a day, usually. But lots of other things too. That’s not *all* I do.” A long pause, during which he tosses a pebble. “Don’t you get lonely?” \n\nLan Wangji blinks. He had anticipated scorn, at the very least gentle teasing. Wei Wuxian looks at him, serious. \n\n“I’d get so lonely,” he says. He flicks another pebble with precision at the stick. “I like having people around, to do things. It doesn’t have to be much. Just to talk to, at least. Don’t you like someone to talk to, Lan Zhan?”\n\n*No,* is the obvious and correct answer to that—the word sticks on his tongue, Lan Wangji unable to make himself say it before Wei Wuxian continues. \n\n“It’s nice to have that, especially when you’re not used to silence all the time. Lotus Pier isn’t quiet, like Cloud Recesses. There’s always something to do. Swimming, or fishing. Picnics. Flying kites. What’s your favorite thing to do, just for fun? Do you like flying kites?” \n\nLan Wangji watches a pebble skid wide. “I do sword drills,” he says. \n\n“That’s work, Lan Zhan. I said fun.”\n\n“I read books.”\n\nWei Wuxian looks at him again.\n\n“I *like* books,” Lan Wangji says. \n\n“Lan Zhan,” he says. “Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan.” Wei Wuxian cups his palm, passing him a handful of pebbles. “Of course *you’d* rather have *books* than swimming in rivers.”\n\nLan Wangji rolls a pebble on the pad of his thumb. He hesitates, then tosses it. It neatly taps the stick. “There are cold springs for bathing.”\n\nWei Wuxian doesn’t have to say *bathing* isn’t *swimming.* “If we were in Yunmeng, I’d take you to the river,” he says. “It’s so hot in the summer, you’d have to live in the water. You’d probably get sunburnt and the skin would peel off your nose, but I’d help you stay in the shade. We’d catch carp, with our bare hands. Have you ever done that, Lan Zhan? I’d cook them for you on the fire, just like this, and you could sleep in the grass while our clothes dried, tired out from all the times I chased you underwater.”\n\nA pebble skitters, landing short. Lan Wangji selects another. \n\n“You’d like that, I know, even though you’d never say it. Then I’d be such a good friend, you could meditate for hours and read all the books we have at Lotus Pier.” \n\nWei Wuxian bumps his shoulder. He smiles at him sideways as his pebble lands closer than Lan Wangji’s did. \n\n“I win, Lan Zhan,” he says, although there are no rules and no score and they haven’t really even been playing. He collects another handful of pebbles and starts over again. \n\n---- \n\n“*No,*” Lan Wangji snaps, pain clawing in every direction as he moves too abruptly, blindly shoving the tangled mess of black hair and red ribbon off of his lap. Wei Wuxian, bleary with sleep, recoils backwards, affronted.\n\n“What the—? Lan Zhan!” \n\n“*No,*” Lan Wangji says with force. He is bleary with sleep too. And pain. And anger. And helplessness. \n\nHe has *possibly* overreacted. But Wei Wuxian in his lap, sound asleep, had not been a scenario he anticipated waking up to.\n\n“The ground is so rocky. You *told* me to sleep,” Wei Wuxian says.\n\n“Sleep. Over *there,*” Lan Wangji says, his usual economy of words reduced even more. \n\nWei Wuxian looks at the designated stretch of rocky ground. “It’s not like I hurt you,” he grumbles. “You just sleep sitting there, anyway. I didn’t jostle your leg. It’s the other side. I was *careful.*” \n\nIt is indeed the other side, which has also kept Lan Wangji closest to the fire, but they aren’t discussing these considerations.\n\n“I thought you wouldn’t care,” Wei Wuxian goes on, exaggerating his contriteness for sympathy. He yawns. “I’m so *tired.*” \n\nLan Wangji closes his eyes, then opens them quickly in case that encourages Wei Wuxian to put his head back in his lap. “You can’t—” he says.\n\nWei Wuxian waits. \n\n“You can’t just—”\n\nWei Wuxian yawns again, not putting it on this time. “I didn’t think you would care,” he repeats more seriously, which has to be the biggest lie he has told in recent memory. Of course Lan Wangji always *cares* about being touched, or hauled around, or having his ribbon stripped off and tied around other limbs. Wei Wuxian knows these things and does them anyway, and it’s been a long time since Lan Wangji has done anything but allow it.\n\nWei Wuxian retreats, taking the outer robe he had draped across Lan Wangji and pointedly crumpling it into a pillow to stuff under his head, well out of reach, on the other side of the fire. He glares at Lan Wangji, laying his head down with a sigh of long-suffering. \n\nLan Wangji leans back, closing his eyes, willing his heartbeat to subside to a reasonable pace. Pain stabs him like a knife, his leg throbbing. He counts through a few breaths, trying to release the worst of the ache, along with the tension that is laced in tight knots through his shoulders.\n\nHis mind proves harder to quiet. He is unable to sweep his thoughts away, make his mind a blank slate. Self-awareness creeps back in, as does reason. As does a not-insubstantial amount of shame. The fire crackles calmly, and it’s with dread curling in the pit of his stomach that he finally says, “Wei Ying.”\n\nWei Wuxian is not sleeping. He continues pretending he is. Lan Wangji could do that too, accept the excuse with gratitude and face it all again in the… whatever passes for morning in the dark underground. \n\n“Wei Ying.”\n\nWei Wuxian stirs, performatively sulking a little. \n\nLan Wangji says it a third time, “Wei Ying,” and Wei Wuxian cracks an eye open in his direction. \n\nLan Wangji sighs. He is not going to make this easy. Or maybe he is, because then Wei Wuxian says, after the silence goes on too long, “What, Lan Zhan? Is that you saying, ‘sorry, Wei Ying, I was being ridiculous’?”\n\nLan Wangji nods, once. It’s Wei Wuxian’s turn to sigh. \n\n“Fine. Whatever. It’s okay. I’m… sorry too.”\n\nSomehow that makes it worse, this pit of dread and shame writhing in Lan Wangji’s belly. It’s not okay. It never has been. “I—” There are words that won’t form, a whole language that has never been at home on his tongue. That might not even exist. “I don’t—”\n\nWei Wuxian rolls onto his belly, propping up on his elbows, his hair falling out of its ribbon and over his shoulders. “I didn’t mean to freak you out, okay? I mean, lots of times I do. It’s fun to tease you. Need Lan Zhan to cough up blood? I’ll get naked! I *thought,* though, that it was maybe because you actually… you know, you’d thought about it so that’s why it…” Maybe there are words that fail Wei Wuxian too. He clears his throat, cheeks pink, and tries again. “You know, how there are things you’ve decided you can’t have because you’re ridiculous and a Lan but you like it when I make you do them anyway. Like eat sweets. Or miss curfew. Or…”\n\n*Kiss you,* Lan Wangji thinks. A knot is lodged in his throat. It’s the closest they’ve come to acknowledging that happened.\n\nWei Wuxian is going valiantly on. “—wouldn’t ever if you didn’t really want me to, though. I thought you did, is all. But if you don’t…”\n\nLan Wangji swallows. He nods before Wei Wuxian can finish the sentence. Before he can realize he’s nodding and stop himself. \n\nWei Wuxian falters, face on the verge of falling. “You don’t?” \n\nNo. No, he meant—yes. He meant that Wei Wuxian is right. Yes to all of it. He wants it all, and he wants the plausible deniability of pretending he does not want, and perhaps it has reached the point where he can no longer have both. He closes his eyes, tired and hungry and miserable enough to admit which one he would rather give up. “Yes,” he says, making his throat form the word. \n\n“Yes, what?”\n\n“Yes I do. Want that. I…”\n\nThe admission almost chokes him, even with no one else around for miles. There is a long dreaded silence. Only because it is so long does he hear the slight scraping of pebbles, someone trying to move silently in the dark. He opens his eyes, and Wei Wuxian is there. He has crawled over quietly, helpfully. Uncertainly. The sulk has fallen off his face; he looks as vulnerable now as Lan Wangji has ever seen him. \n\nLan Wangji’s heart feels like a bruise, raw and tender in his chest. He had thought he was the only one who felt desperately vulnerable. Wei Wuxian doesn’t fear anything. Wei Wuxian fights dire owls and demon tortoises; he taunts Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu with merry exuberance. The look on his face says that Wei Wuxian fears this.\n\nLan Wangji doesn’t move a muscle, which makes Wei Wuxian tentatively respond to that welcome, crawling down and resting his head cautiously on Lan Wangji’s lap. \n\nThe panic still flaps in his chest, the same as when Wei Wuxian says things like *I’ll carry you* or starts stripping off clothing. It flaps, but then it—settles. Touch, the thing he’s been so frightened of, does not obliterate him after all. Light as a bird that is still fledging its feathers, he rests his hand on Wei Wuxian’s head.\n\nWei Wuxian peeks up. “Lan Zhan, do not throw up on my head.”\n\nIn reply, Lan Wangji digs his fingers into his hair and tugs sharply. \n\nWei Wuxian gasps, then snuggles down, apparently reassured of his welcome. When Lan Wangji politely removes his hand, Wei Wuxian politely places it back. Unaccustomed to this, Lan Wangji hesitates, then haltingly strokes the tangled mass of his hair. Then he strokes it again. It is silk, and he eventually and carefully begins to unknot it, combing his fingers down through the long length, allowed to have this, a gift received more than given. \n\nWei Wuxian almost purrs, drowsy with contentment. Lan Wangji’s mind snags on that, flooded suddenly with a memory nearly a decade old. He couldn’t have been more than eight; they kept a sleek gray mouser in the kitchens, and he was the first to discover the litter of kittens she had birthed in secret. His little heart had nearly burst with wonder, lap full of tiny, warm, wriggling things, falling all over themselves to let him pet and cuddle them for hours on end.\n\nHe had been punished for that, discovered when he never heard the bell calling him to the evening meal. He was pulled to his feet, marched back to the dormitories, harshly scolded for lack of discipline, and for weeks he had searched through every nook, cranny and bolt-hole he could find in Cloud Recesses but the kittens were never seen again. \n\nWei Wuxian, in his lap, has turned his head up to look at him. Lan Wangji’s hand has gone still; Wei Wuxian is checking, uncertain again, to see if the permission has been revoked. \n\nLan Wangji resumes stroking his scalp, unsnarling a strand of hair from the red ribbon. Satisfied, Wei Wuxian settles back down, closing his eyes and allowing himself to drift back towards sleep. \n\n---- \n\n“I like your cold springs cave better,” Wei Wuxian decides, the fourth day. “Lan Yi was nice, and it was beautiful, and there were bunnies to play with.”\n\nThe steady chill, the stale air, has made Wei Wuxian overcompensate with the fire. He’s built it up too high, and they’re enduring it, sweating through their robes. Even so, it is a preposterous statement—one Lan Wangji is willing to allow for the sake of distraction.\n\n“Mn,” he says, neutrally enough that Wei Wuxian will not be able to easily discern whether it means yes or no.\n\nWei Wuxian lifts up his hair, piling it on top of his head, leaning back against the wall. A bead of sweat slides down his neck. “Winter. Cloud Recesses. Lan Zhan. Tell me stories.”\n\nLan Wangji can feel the sweat prickling his scalp, pooling on his spine. He makes himself look sharply away from Wei Wuxian’s glistening neck.\n\n“Lan Zhan. Winter. Cloud Recesses,” Wei Wuxian repeats like snapping his fingers to get his attention. He closes his eyes and sighs dreamily. “There must be so much snow.”\n\nLan Wangji is worn out enough, his defenses down enough, that *snow* twists in his heart, another lingering sense-memory that should have faded long before now. “There is snow,” he agrees.\n\n“And it’s beautiful.” \n\n“It’s very beautiful.”\n\nWei Wuxian hums appreciatively. “Have you been in the cold springs when it’s winter?”\n\nHe has been in the cold springs in every type of weather imaginable. He has been when snow drops on the surface, when the air is so bone-chilling that his teeth clack uncontrollably, so cold the water’s almost warm, his senses all confused. He has followed cold down through the very concept of cold, down through pain, out to some heady precipice where it just feels effervescent and numbing. It’s like… he’s not exactly sure what it’s like. He once sat down with ink, brush, and paper, tried to put it in a poem, and failed.\n\nHe tells Wei Wuxian the first part, the way the snow touches the water and doesn’t immediately melt.\n\n“You’d *have* to get naked then,” Wei Wuxian muses, almost to himself. “If you got out in wet robes you’d freeze to death on the spot before you could get dry or warm.” \n\nSo then there’s heat now, more of it, just when Lan Wangji had almost conjured the mental sensation of cold. He can feel his skin, livid. He is tired and filthy and it’s not too dramatic to say he is dying of hunger—this should not be difficult.\n\n“Lan Zhan, *do* you get naked?”\n\n“Wei Ying,” he tries to say sharply. Instead, he sounds a little hoarse. \n\nWei Wuxian says nothing, which is so unprecedented that Lan Wangji makes the fatal mistake of opening his eyes to look.\n\nWei Wuxian is smiling. He is lounging back against the rock, one arm on his head, a pile of inky hair slipping down his neck, like a picture in a book that Lan Wangji should not know exists. He is watching Lan Wangji, and smiling. Not even wickedly. Just a smile that is lovely and knowing, that could make a man walk off a cliff and fall to his death.\n\n“*Wei Ying,*” Wei Wuxian growls softly, imitating Lan Wangji’s voice. \n\n“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says, since that seems to be all he can say.\n\nWei Wuxian’s face changes. He reads Lan Wangji’s face, finds something there that makes the knowing drop away, the pure loveliness remain. Lan Wangji’s breath catches. The moment stretches out like honey pulled out of its comb, their gazes locked, the blazing heat on his face and the crackling glow of the fire.\n\nWhich one of them tips forward first, he doesn’t know. All he knows is that Wei Wuxian meets him, already there when Lan Wangji lays their faces together and touches his lips with the dry, burning heat of his own.\n\nWei Wuxian kisses him back, a *rightness* about it that threads down his spine. It’s a shiver, in the heat. \n\nThey don’t pull apart; the kiss ends, and they stay close, breath mingling. So close that it doesn’t take anything, Wei Wuxian’s fingers sliding around the back of his neck, to pull him back in. \n\nLan Wangji has not had a drop of liquor this time. His head swims with it anyway, the soft press and drag of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, lips chapped from days of rationing water. He is dizzy with the knowledge that he can have this again, dizzy with the slightly clumsy way Wei Wuxian is pressing against him. Dizzy with the way he’s kissing Wei Wuxian back. Clumsy too, mouths pressed together, a strange feeling—*joy*—humming through him. His stomach clenching with pleasure. Wei Wuxian hisses softly like hot stones hitting water. \n\nLan Wangji’s hand has slid down over his chest, where it hurts, where the brand is. He pulls it back, stricken. \n\nWincing, Wei Wuxian rubs at the wound, then shakes his head, leans back in.\n\nThis time it is the sharp intake of Lan Wangji’s breath that stops them, pain searing down through his leg when Wei Wuxian brushes against it. “Sorry, Lan Zhan,” he whispers, sucking in air through his teeth, wincing on his behalf.\n\nThe reality of their circumstances is demanding attention. There is nothing ideal about it—they are hot, cramped, trapped, exhausted, lightheaded from hunger, in pain. They bump noses, adjust their weight, shift position, try again. And then Wei Wuxian is pulling back, letting his hands drop away without Lan Wangji’s permission.\n\nIt is like before, the kiss pulling out like the tide, leaving Lan Wangji on the shore. To clutch at it is to have it slide through his fingers like water. \n\nAt least this time there is no pledge to never speak of it again. Wei Wuxian sits back, still close enough for their sleeves to brush. He picks a piece of ash off Lan Wangji’s robe, then smoothes a wrinkle, fussy little touches that don’t help calm the racing of Lan Wangji’s heart. And then Lan Wangji is looking up because he’s gotten to his feet. \n\n“I should—” Wei Wuxian says, and trails off. He gestures instead, a vague flop of his arm, picking up his black robe and disappearing into the darkness before Lan Wangji can make his tongue form the words, *come back.*\n\n---- \n\n“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nLater that night, by the fire. Wei Wuxian has returned, freshly scrubbed from the pond. Bringing his damp robe for Lan Wangji to wash the soot and sweat off his skin. His outer robe, flimsy and dark, which has been wrung out and dried so many times there’s not much fine fabric left to ruin. Tomorrow Wei Wuxian will don it again, along with his belt and vambraces, and they will fight a monster. \n\nThat accounts partially for the mood at the fire. Wei Wuxian is subdued, lost in his thoughts as he runs his robe through his hands, drying it over the flames. Tomorrow will be the last, best chance they have. Lan Wangji’s leg can bear more weight than yesterday; if they wait longer, they’ll be weaker. Together they’ve shared the nightly ration of water, the last of their medicine. The little burst of spring sunshine arrives, fainter now, but still there.\n\nAnother small stretch of quiet. “Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says again. \n\nWei Wuxian looks up, blinking. “Hmm?”\n\n“I—” Lan Wangji says. \n\nWei Wuxian, sensing something that needs his attention, folds the robe up, discarding it. He scoots back, reclaiming his place by the wall. “What?” he prompts Lan Wangji, nudging his elbow, after a fraught moment of silence. “Oh no.” He gasps. “Lan Zhan is going to tell me he’s sorry. Tell me how much he likes Mianmian.”\n\nIt’s a tease, like the first time. Wei Wuxian drawing him out, never as careless or oblivious as he lets on. But he says it a little bit recklessly, as if nerves get the better of him despite trying to hide it.\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says. \n\n“You *are* going to say sorry. That’s your sorry voice.”\n\n“No.” \n\nHe is not going to say that. It twists in his gut, like the way his hands twist in his robes, how un-sorry he is. But—there is something, Wei Wuxian is not completely wrong. \n\n“I never—I have only—” Lan Wangji swallows. He can do this. “If I did something badly, it would be helpful to know.” He announces it to the fire, his palms damp where his fists rest on his knees.\n\nOnce again, though, he finds himself looking over when Wei Wuxian doesn’t answer. \n\n“You mean— Lan Zhan. How would *I* know?” Wei Wuxian asks him sincerely. “How many people do you think I have kissed?”\n\nLan Wangji was not expecting that question. He tries to think, safely. “…Many?”\n\nWei Wuxian’s smile is slow-blooming and lazy and utterly provocative. “One,” he says. \n\n“One…?”\n\n“*You,*” he says, in case Lan Wangji is slow. “So I’m flattered I am so obviously excellent at it that I must have kissed hundreds of people, Lan Zhan, but alas, I am naturally gifted, only you, I have been perfectly virtuous, saving myself for—ow!”\n\nIt feels wonderful to throw a handful of stones at him. Only once before has Lan Wangji given into that physical impulse—in the library, tearing an explicit book to shreds in his hands. It helps him rebalance, calm the head-spin from *one, you, only you.*\n\n“So if you would like to do it again—”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWei Wuxian halts mid-sentence. It is wonderful too, to throw him so badly. Even if Lan Wangji blurted the word before he could think. \n\n“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says. \n\n“Yes.” Lan Wangji nods.\n\n“You want to—”\n\nLan Wangji nods.\n\n“Here?”\n\nNods.\n\n“Now?”\n\nNods. \n\n“But your leg?”\n\n“Is not falling off.” There are limits to Lan Wangji’s patience. \n\nWei Wuxian gulps, bravado slipping. Lan Wangji, committed to this path of destruction, watches the slide of his throat. \n\n“Now?” he says again. \n\nLan Wangji, sometimes, is forced to take initiative. He can’t exactly rise up on his knees; instead, he drags Wei Wuxian over by the front of his robe into the full force of his kiss. \n\nWei Wuxian kind of—*mmumphs.* They collide. It does jar his leg, but Lan Wangji is briefly beyond caring. He does not let Wei Wuxian go; when he finally pulls back, Wei Wuxian stares at him, eyes huge, then coughs and breaks into laughter that sheds more warmth than the fire. \n\n“Lan Zhan!” he exclaims, scandalized, and pushes their mouths back together with no finesse whatsoever. He is half in Lan Wangji’s lap before good sense arrives and he darts backwards enough to avoid Lan Wangji’s leg. \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says irrationally, not releasing his grip on the front of Wei Wuxian’s robe. \n\nWei Wuxian pats his hand gently, prying his fingers loose. “I have an idea,” he assures him, which has never *not* struck fear in Lan Wangji’s heart. Before he knows how to accommodate this turn of events, Wei Wuxian has climbed across him, dropping over to his good side. He taps Lan Wangji’s knee, the one that does not make his head spin in agony. “Lan Zhan. Open your legs.”\n\nAt Lan Wangji’s look, he rolls his eyes so dramatically they might fall out of his head. \n\n“So I don’t hurt the bad one,” he says. \n\nOh. Lan Wangji… obeys. Wei Wuxian straddles his good leg, perching there, one knee between them, keeping most of his weight off of Lan Wangji’s thigh.\n\n“How’s this?” he asks. “Hurts?”\n\nLan Wangji checks. He shakes his head no. \n\n“Good,” Wei Wuxian says. He licks his lips, surveying the options for his next course of action. He settles down a bit more, so they’re mostly face to face, resting his hands on Lan Wangji’s shoulders. Then he frowns, taking Lan Wangji’s empty hands, placing one on the back of his neck, the other safely at his waist, out of reach of the still-tender brand. “All right?”\n\n*No.* Very much *not all right.* Very much *not ever going to be all right again.* \n\nLan Wangji jerks his head in a nod. \n\nThe smile returns, the one from before, the slow-blooming one, full of delight and lazy provocation. Wei Wuxian’s hands come back to rest on Lan Wangji’s shoulders. He leans in, close enough that his breath ghosts over his lips. “Lan Zhan?”\n\nLan Wangji, staring at the way Wei Wuxian’s mouth glistens, red as a berry, says, “Mn?”\n\n“Kiss me.”\n\nLan Wangji finds his heart beating wildly. This is… real, without the plausible deniability of impulse or frustration or even the helpful pretext of inebriation. He can’t help it, he freezes, too much to process at once, and if he does this wrong— \n\nWei Wuxian huffs fondly, tips his face up and kisses him. \n\nIt’s a *kiss.* Slow and real, and intent, not the clumsy crushing of mouths Lan Wangji had attempted. His grip tightens, fingers digging into Wei Wuxian’s waist, into the nape of his neck. Wei Wuxian responds with a gasp. Heat that is not from the fire curls up Lan Wangji’s spine. \n\nWei Wuxian, when they part, brushes his thumb across Lan Wangji’s cheek. “Ahh. Lan Zhan *does* blush,” he whispers, and more heat, more color floods beneath Lan Wangji’s skin. Grinning, Wei Wuxian bumps him with his nose. He kisses him there, then next to his ear, experimenting. “*You* wanted this, Lan Zhan,” he reminds him, dropping down to nuzzle his neck, a tender spot that sends a flurry of sparks down through Lan Wangji’s body.\n\nLan Wangji is going to combust. He will not get to fight a demon tortoise; he will be a pile of ash on the ground long before rescue comes. He makes a strangled sound in his throat—Wei Wuxian rewards it with laughter, a puff of air that chases shivers up and down Lan Wangji’s skin. \n\nIt feels safest to take back control of kiss. He does, pulling Wei Wuxian back up to his mouth, but Wei Wuxian is not so easily deterred. He nips at Lan Wangji’s mouth, not a kiss. Brushes their lips together, not a kiss. Licks at him, teasing—not a kiss. Then he slides their mouths back together, waiting until instinct has Lan Wangji opening up a fraction and letting him in. \n\nThey both make a sound when their tongues touch. Heat floods odd places on Lan Wangji’s body—the inside of his elbows, his thighs, the top of his scalp. It feels like being born, or like dying. Nothing has prepared him for Wei Wuxian in his mouth making soft, desperate noises, the slick heat of his tongue, drinking Lan Wangji in like he’s the water they’ve had to ration to keep from dying of thirst.\n\nWhen they pull back the next time—nothing is left of the arrogant, loose-limbed flirt. Wei Wuxian is trembling. Lan Wangji is sure he is too, the kisses dragging sensation over his skin like dry grass. \n\n“That,” Wei Wuxian says. Licks his lips. “That was. Is that—Lan Zhan, is that the best we can do?”\n\nLan Wangji drags him back in. A laugh bubbles up, trapped between them. Lan Wangji kisses him quiet, Wei Wuxian pressed against him, one hand on the wall behind Lan Wangji’s head. It is Lan Wangji’s turn to make soft, desperate noises, clinging to him, until Wei Wuxian shifts again, gentling the kiss just a little, winding his arms around Lan Wangji’s neck.\n\nThey kiss like that for ages. They kiss and kiss, sinking down into it, Lan Wangji learning every curve of Wei Wuxian’s lips, every hitch of his breath, each warm, wet angle of Wei Wuxian’s mouth. They find a pace they can sustain and apply themselves to it. They kiss breathlessly, endlessly. They kiss sloppily, playfully. They kiss so slow and so long that they need to pause, parched, and drink from their precious ration of water. Kiss until their lips are bruised; until Lan Wangji’s jaw aches, until his leg is numb with pins and needles. Kiss until they are giddy with it, then serious all over again.\n\n“Wei Ying,” he finally rasps, Wei Wuxian’s hips in his hands. Slithery hips that won’t stop *moving.* They are a hairsbreadth from a *rhythm,* from—Lan Wangji meeting him, moving too. It is taking his last thread of willpower and quite a bit of pain to stop him. And even then—\n\n“We could, though,” Wei Wuxian says. Breath hot on Lan Wangji’s ear. He is panting a little. He says it lightly, the way he once said *you could kiss me, you know. Just as friends. I wouldn’t mind.* One hand has slipped beneath the outer layers of Lan Wangji’s robe, skimming up and down his side where the thin robe fits his body. “We could, Lan Zhan. I wouldn’t hurt you. I promise. I could just—”\n\nLan Wangji screws his eyes shut, leaning back against the rock. He wants to. He wants to so much. He has possibly never wanted anything more in his life than he wants to just let it happen, let their hips press together, where he is so hot and so hard, feel the aching relief, the release of arousal. He can’t even recall a reason for *not* letting it happen. They are here—not ideal, but also, as they’ve established, not entirely prohibitive. His leg—but Wei Wuxian is right, they could be careful, they would try not to hurt him. It is simply habit to fight it. He has been fighting it for what feels like half of his life. \n\n“No, I know,” Wei Wuxian says, conducting his own conversation with Lan Wangji’s silences. “I do. I know. I know we can’t.” \n\n“Wei Ying,” he says again, and doesn’t know what the plea is for. \n\nWei Wuxian makes the choice for them. He kisses Lan Wangji again, a long, slow dip into a pool that is so warm, so all-encompassing, it makes tears spring behind Lan Wangji’s eyelids. His throat closes up, his senses too overwhelmed to do anything but cling to him. And then Wei Wuxian brings it to an end, resting their foreheads together for a moment before he pulls back to look at Lan Wangji. Holding his face in his hands, he smiles bravely, barely faltering. It’s his smile of utter reassurance, conveying, *there is nothing you can do to make me like you less, you have nothing to fear.* \n\n“Can I think about this sometimes?” Wei Wuxian asks him. His hair so wrecked and mouth so kissed that Lan Wangji’s hands tighten vice-like on his hipbones. “Back home. In bed alone. When I think about Lan Zhan late at night, and want to remember how he feels, so I can…” He trails off suggestively.\n\nHe is twinkling again, a little bit wicked. Making it safe for them. Making it normal. Playing the fool. Trying to scandalize Lan Wangji. It will take a lot more than that, even though the flush rises, predictably, all over his skin. \n\n“Yes,” says Lan Wangji, since that scenario means that Wei Wuxian will be home and safe. \n\nWei Wuxian laughs from his belly, dragging Lan Wangji in to smother him with a hug. He drops a kiss on his hair, on his forehead, on the bridge of his nose like a *ridiculous* person. \n\n“You may do the same,” he offers gravely. Then shakes again with mirth, one last kiss in response to the look on Lan Wangji’s face. \n\n---- \n\nAfter a while, they bank the fire. Tend to the few necessities. Wei Wuxian is quiet again, serious, as he checks the bandages on Lan Wangji’s leg. Tomorrow looms over them, once again unavoidable, no more distractions to keep it at bay. \n\nSide by side, they stretch out. The ground is still rocky, the embers popping softly, the coals still shedding warmth. Lan Wangji breathes in and out. Stomach rising and falling beneath his folded hands. \n\nHe turns to look at Wei Wuxian. \n\n“Hmm?” Wei Wuxian says, an arm’s length away in the dark. \n\nAfter a moment, he affects a sigh, obeying the silent order as he drags himself over, arriving as bidden, bedding down snugly at Lan Wangji’s side. \n\n“Better?” Wei Wuxian asks. He reaches for Lan Wangji’s face, mouth puckered, a genuine smile when Lan Wangji swats him away. Satisfied, he rests his arm across Lan Wangji instead, laying his head on his shoulder. \n\nLan Wangji, who is still wearing multiple layers of robes, and who is closest to the fire, tucks the dark outer robe around him. \n\n“Hmmph. *Now* he’s nice to me.” Wei Wuxian grunts drowsily against his chest. “All I had to do was seduce him with my virginal wiles… ow.”\n\nLan Wangji pinches the soft flesh inside his elbow. \n\nWei Wuxian rubs it, hissing, then nestles back down. “Okay gege, I’ll behave.”\n\n---- \n\nIt is achingly intimate, even more so than Wei Wuxian’s tongue in his mouth, to have Wei Wuxian’s voice in his head. If only it could always be so simple—to merely think and have his thoughts arrive in Wei Wuxian’s mind, unobstructed by his own clumsy tongue.\n\nIt is like the dire owl, in the forest. Like the dancing fairy; like the kiss. They work together, instinct that defies all logical thought, the push and pull, the give and take, of being in accord with each other. As fluid as a dance; a life and death dance that they almost lose, right up until they… win. \n\nIt doesn’t feel like a win. It feels like Wei Wuxian’s dead weight in his arms, hauling him limp from the water. It feels like his cold, clammy pallor, his weak, erratic pulse. It feels like Lan Wangji’s own hands, shredded to ribbons, slick with blood, helpless to do anything except offer the very last thread of his spiritual energy. His heart seizing when Wei Wuxian coughs and smiles weakly. \n\nAnd asks him to sing. \n\n----\n\nTime truly stops, this time. Lan Wangji only thought the hours bled out before. One day, possibly—possibly two. It ceases to have any meaning, any unit of time that isn’t the ragged space between Wei Wuxian’s breaths. \n\nRescue, when it comes, finds him clutching Wei Wuxian the way Wei Wuxian clutches the sword. It is a cacophony, disorienting, a nightmare, a blur—Lan Wangji is shaken awake, spoken to like an irrational child about how they are here now and he must let Wei Wuxian go. \n\nUp above, it is blinding. He drinks all the water they’ll give him, eats a few bites of mild rations, and doesn’t leave Wei Wuxian’s side. \n\n“What’s that ugly thing he’s got?” Jiang Wanyin demands. \n\n“It’s his,” is all Lan Wangji says. \n\n“Whatever.”\n\nHours pass. Half a day. He needs to go. They’ve told him all the news they’ve heard from Gusu. Not much. He needs to go. Jin Zixuan can spare a few men to send with him, and provisions. He pleads in silence, *wake up,* which is no more effective than it was in the cave. \n\n*I’ll come find you,* he vows, mentally pressing the words into Wei Wuxian’s mind the way they had done underground. *In Lotus Pier, I’ll come find you. As soon as I can. They’ll take care of you now.* \n\nDuty might tear him in two. Carefully, Lan Wangji pulls a strand of hair back from Wei Wuxian’s sweat-streaked, pale face. They’re alone, but too many Jins and Jiangs mill about to kiss him. \n\n*I’ll come,* he swears, leaving. *As soon as I can. No matter what.*\n\n----\n\nHe is not able to change anything. Find his brother, save Cloud Recesses. Make his uncle well again. It either happens or it doesn’t, regardless of his presence. \n\nSo it haunts him—what if—what if Wei Wuxian—*after.* What if he had stayed. If he had been *there,* instead of elsewhere, and helpless. \n\nWould it have mattered? Would things have changed?\n\n---\n[[private/cql/3 - unclean realm|Next - Unclean Realm]]","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/3-unclean-realm":{"title":"Chapter 3 — Unclean Realm","content":"\nWei Wuxian is dead. \n\nTwo months, then three. That’s what people begin saying. \n\n*Beat him like a sandbag,* a Wen soldier boasts. Laughter. *Showed that arrogant brat.* Snap of a cord around a neck. \n\nNobody has answers. Jin Zixuan says, *His sister says it isn’t like him…* Jiang Wanyin says, *We thought he went to Lanling for you.* \n\nIt’s unthinkable, what else they say. Burial Mounds. No one survives it. Nobody returns from that place with body or soul intact, not even Wei Wuxian.\n\nThis is war, and that’s warfare: wild and unfounded rumors. Lan Wangji tells himself that. He holds out hope, he builds defenses. Becomes as stubborn as he has ever been in his life. Wei Wuxian would be proud. Wei Wuxian would call him a ridiculous person. Wei Wuxian would tackle him with exuberance, say, *Lan Zhan, I’m all right! What on earth were you thinking? You really did all that for me?*\n\nThis is not what happens. \n\nThis happens instead: Wen Chao dies, and Wei Wuxian lives. It’s Lan Wangji’s wildest dream, and it comes true like a nightmare. Like a ghost that stands before him in Wei Wuxian’s robes, alive in Wei Wuxian’s body, and not Wei Wuxian at all. \n\n*Who do you think you are?* this new Wei Wuxian asks him, dark eyes that don’t spark with laughter, a smile that doesn’t reach past his lips. *Second Young Master Lan. Hanguang-jun. Lan Wangji*—the cold reversal of every intimacy that Wei Wuxian has given him. Malevolent energy so tangible it almost coils in the air. \n\nAll Lan Wangji can think, in that moment and after, through the turmoil and betrayal: \n\n*Who are* you? *Wei Ying, what on earth have you done?*\n\n---- \n\nIt is an artful performance—no wonder Lan Wangji endures an excruciating week of believing it. \n\nHe takes grim solace in the guqin. Wei Wuxian is hailed a hero. “Lan Wangji,” he says politely whenever they cross each other’s path, slid like a knife between his ribs. \n\nRumors fly that they’re fighting, but it’s nothing so clear cut as a fight, it’s just confusion and distance. Lan Wangji craves a fight, fights make Wei Wuxian *smile,* a clash of swords like a dance except Wei Wuxian won’t even carry Suibian around with him, not even to deflect suspicion.\n\n“Young Master Wei has always been difficult,” Lan Xichen notes wryly. (Lan Xichen, who has returned himself, also changed, also more polite than ever, a new shadow in his eyes.)\n\nIt’s more than Lan Wangji can bear. He sits awake in the tender, bruised-purple hour before dawn, calming his mind with meditation, when the tiny splinter of a thought finally pushes to the fore. \n\nEverything about this feels familiar. Cool silence, cutting words—it’s Lan Wangji’s own tactics, turned against him. It’s exactly how he tried to survive that interminable summer in Cloud Recesses, in so deep over his head he couldn’t see a way out. Or the long days in Qishan, needing to keep Wei Wuxian out of harm’s way, desperately feigning indifference while Wen Chao stalked them like a wolf. \n\nWhatever Wei Wuxian has done—he is trying to guard Lan Wangji from it. Or whatever has been done to him—he is trying to stubbornly survive it himself. \n\nWhich is just… fuck, it’s *just like him.* Noble and *stupid* and it’s all Lan Wangji can do to not fly across the compound, drag him out of bed, throttle sense into him until Wei Wuxian capitulates and gives him the *truth.* \n\nHe is more subtle than that, in the end. Although not by much. If Wei Wuxian wants to play by old tactics, then Lan Wangji will give him old tactics. He pulls Bichen, drives him back with a flurry of his most vicious sword work. It feels *right,* like a kiss, to land the blade at his throat.\n\nIt works. It’s their old language of provocation and combat, the calling of each other’s bluff. Wei Wuxian drops the act, drops his guard, and Lan Wangji’s heart sings like the blade he drops back in its sheath as the real Wei Wuxian, raw and rattled and honest, finally, *finally,* meets his gaze. \n\n---- \n\nThey talk, on the rooftop. The first rooftop, since the last rooftop. Tentatively, they bridge part of the gap between them, begin to forge a new path. There are still acres of terrain that Wei Wuxian is avoiding—Lan Wangji lets him. He has every intention of not giving up, of plying trust out of him the way Wei Wuxian plied him first, with friendship, with relentless, annoying, dogged endurance, not content until Lan Wangji was malleable clay in his hands. \n\nIt’s not enough, and it’s a start. The first green shoot of spring after a desolate winter. Lan Wangji would stay there all night; it’s Wei Wuxian who leaves. *Yes,* he agrees, though, to Lan Wangji’s offer of help. Wicked tricks, crafty tricks, Lan Wangji isn’t sure the semantics matter. It’s just like Wei Wuxian to go and do something rash, but whatever he’s done, Lan Wangji can believe that he had his reasons, and Lan Wangji will stick by him until they can solve it together. \n\nBack in his rooms, Lan Xichen appears in the doorway as Lan Wangji plays the qin. He stands there quietly, listening for a while until Lan Wangji moves through the coda, resting his hands on the strings instead of looping the melody endlessly again. \n\n“I haven’t heard that piece before,” Lan Xichen says, and something soft twinges in Lan Wangji’s heart—how long they have been apart; how much has changed for him without his brother’s knowledge. It feels disloyal, almost, to hold secrets from him. To not disclose what has happened, where his heart’s loyalties lie. \n\n“Mn,” is all he says. \n\n“It’s lovely. Did you compose it?”\n\n“Mn.”\n\n“May I join you for the next one?”\n\nLan Wangji assents. His brother draws out Liebing, and the sudden association of a flute makes Lan Wangji pause. After a moment, he asks—are there Lan temperament techniques he might not be aware of, more advanced methods than the ones he was taught? \n\n“Perhaps,” Lan Xichen says thoughtfully. “If we…” He trails off, unable to finish the sentence. *If we return to Cloud Recesses… if it’s rebuilt, if those texts still exist…* “I will see what I can find for you,” he says, and offers Lan Wangji a wan smile. \n\n---- \n\nIt’s with great relief that Lan Wangji slips back into the background, ceding Lan Xichen his rightful place as the head of the clan. Leadership doesn’t suit him; too much finesse is needed, a constant tolerance of people’s behavior, a level of political tact that is quite frankly beyond him.\n\nHe still attends the long meetings, the endless hours of plotting strategy, but only as an auxiliary. No one looks to him to speak, which is a relief, especially when tempers flare, the strain wearing them all down like an iron cask beneath water. \n\nJiang Wanyin is just as ill-suited for the role. He is both deferential and belligerent, wearing his newfound authority like an ill-fitting cloak. He clashes with Wei Wuxian daily. It becomes a common occurrence to hear one or both of their voices rising, bouncing off the courtyard walls. Lan Wangji, if he’s in earshot, places himself nearby, in case Wei Wuxian should wish for an escape. It irks Jiang Wanyin, who’s regained his old habit of scowling at Lan Wangji for the mere fact of his existence, their uneasy truce collapsing. \n\n“He’s just worried,” Wei Wuxian says after one of their spats, sounding tired, sounding restless, falling into his old habit too of defending his sect brother. “Shijie says he’s not sleeping.”\n\n“Are you?” Lan Wangji asks. \n\n“Ha! Me? Lan Zhan. I sleep *too much,* like a baby. You can’t even wake me in the mornings.”\n\nIt’s a lie, and a transparent one. Lan Wangji rises before dawn, and too often now he finds Wei Wuxian awake during those hours, prowling around on some errand or toying with notes on his flute, purple shadows beneath his eyes like bruises. If Jiang Yanli is on duty, then he haunts the kitchens, keeping her company as she oversees preparations for the day’s meals. That’s where Lan Wangji finds him most mornings—sleeves rolled up, tasked with some chore, looking more at home there than amongst the clan leaders or the troops in the field. He’s hiding out, Lan Wangji knows, but as pale and thin as he is—there are worse places than the kitchens. \n\n“A-Xian, stop!” Jiang Yanli’s voice wafts from the kitchens on this particular morning. A scolding sing-song as she—Lan Wangji glimpses through the doorway—shoos him off a tray of dumplings. \n\n“Shijie!” Mouth full. “But it’s so delicious. I’m starving.”\n\n“You are not.” \n\nDeftly, she sets a basket of leeks in his arms, with directions on where to take it. Deftly, he ditches it, returning like a fly to the pot of soup bubbling away on the fire, dipping a spoon into it as soon as her back is turned. Lan Wangji, who has not seen him pick at more than a few bites in the dining hall all week, takes note. Apparently his sister has mastered this art—the way to get Wei Wuxian to eat more than his share is to scold him for doing so. Lan Wangji would nag him to eat, and then Wei Wuxian would get stubborn. \n\n“Xianxian!” she says, turning around to catch him. “Are you three years old? Behave yourself.” \n\n“Xianxian *is* behaving,” he says, a pout that is rendered partially ineffective by the amount of food in his mouth. He swallows it down, dipping the spoon again. “Xianxian is being *so* good. Xianxian deserves a—”\n\n“Hanguang-jun,” Jiang Yanli says, suddenly abashed, catching sight of Lan Wangji.\n\nWei Wuxian turns around. The mood doesn’t change, exactly, but his smile shifts, a shade more mannered, less playful than it had been a moment before. He purposefully relaxes his shoulders, walking over, aware of his sister’s eyes on him, and says warmly, “Lan Zhan. What are you doing here at this hour? Did you miss me?”\n\nIt is just as purposeful and flippant as the rest, the kind of thing Wei Wuxian says so no one takes him seriously. He is still holding the spoon, and he lifts it, other hand cupped beneath it, offering Lan Wangji a taste. \n\nIt’s a dare. Or a bluff. “You’ll offend shijie,” he pouts. “After I told you so many times how she makes the best soup in the world.”\n\nJiang Yanli has been distracted by one of the cooks, conferring over a list of ingredients. They might as well be in private on this side of the room. Lan Wangji doesn’t allow himself to relent, his lips pressed tightly together, and Wei Wuxian’s face softens, swallowing the spoonful himself without further teasing. \n\n“You would have died for food like this in Xuanwu Cave,” Wei Wuxian chides him lightly. A shadow flickers in his eyes. “How’s your leg? I never asked.”\n\nIt feels like a lifetime ago, the broken bone, a promise that Wei Wuxian never heard in the throes of a fever. The Jin physicians were qualified; the bone has fully mended. \n\nLan Wangji nods. \n\nWei Wuxian softens his face again. “See? Lan Zhan. Told you we would be heroes.” He turns, raising his voice for an audience before Lan Wangji realizes they have one. “Shijie? Aren’t we heroes? Told Lan Zhan we would be, even though he doesn’t ever believe me.”\n\nJiang Yanli, composure intact once more, sets down a tray of teacups beside a pot of fragrant tea. “Yes, you’re heroes,” she says, with the air of one used to indulging Wei Wuxian, patting his head fondly, which he has bowed so she could reach. She begins pouring tea for the three of them, neatly sidestepping any refusals Lan Wangji could make by simply not giving him a choice. \n\nWei Wuxian smiles as she does this, one of his most interior smiles, as if it’s only for himself, basking for a moment in the comfort of being so well-loved. Lan Wangji cannot blame him. Something twists in his heart; an old pain, years old, a longing so acute it almost takes his breath away. If he could have this, he would bask in it too, like a dry ground soaks up rain. \n\n---- \n\nOne would think Lan Wangji would be well suited for it, the regimental discipline of the military, the sameness of the routine stamped out day after day. The logistical preparations for battle, the methodical drills, the painstaking adherence to regulations. \n\nOnly if one didn’t know him. It does not suit him at all, wearying him beyond measure. Discipline should be spiritual, aimed at higher cultivation, not for training men to march toward death in the proper formations. He misses the crisp air of Cloud Recesses, the musty solitude of the library, with a palpable ache. \n\nWei Wuxian—to exactly no one’s surprise—chafes under it too. He is as intractable as ever, disappearing for long stretches of time, dodging any duty that doesn’t involve the kitchens or his sister. There is an ongoing quarrel where he refuses to run sword drills with the Yunmeng recruits. As punishment—Lan Wangji’s homesick heart almost yearns—Wei Wuxian is banished to the storeroom, tasked with taking inventory. He and Lan Xichen, when they hear this, exchange an inscrutable look. \n\n“Hanguang-jun,” Wei Wuxian greets him when Lan Wangji goes to find him. It’s the jovial tone that still puts distance between them, not quite the warm teasing that has always drawn Lan Wangji in. “To what do I owe the honor? If you’ve come to lecture me on duty and diligence, I’ve heard it all from Jiang Cheng.”\n\nTorches line the walls of the room, flickering as Lan Wangji passes. The stone is thick, the air cool and stale underground. Lan Wangji cannot help but think—all in all, he prefers rooftops. \n\n“No,” he says. \n\n“Then they’ve sent you to watch me? Ah, Lan Wangji, like old times.”\n\nThe last few Nie disciples have scattered at the sight of him, leaving them alone in the room. “No,” Lan Wangji says again. No one has sent him; he has no excuse. *Want to be near you,* true as it is, seems a desperate thing to say. \n\n“No?” Wei Wuxian says. “What then? Lan Zhan is here to *help*?” \n\nLan Wangji walks up beside him, observing the mess over his shoulder. Several logbooks are spread open, the pages in disarray, the columns inked crookedly. Ink stains Wei Wuxian’s fingertips; a streak of it is smudged on his chin. Lan Wangji half expects to spot a pair of stick figures kissing. He endures the violent fit of nostalgia, mentally tallying a column, finding the figures are correct even if the brushwork is appalling. “You’ll never learn, if I help.” \n\n“I’ll never learn anyway,” Wei Wuxian promises. Happiness lights his face, cheerfully surrendering the brush as Lan Wangji takes it from him. Lan Wangji locates a fresh page, tracing a neat column. \n\n“Tent stakes,” Lan Wangji requests, and Wei Wuxian moves off to find them, a full crate he starts counting one by one. \n\n---- \n\nThey work til nightfall, the tedious labor at least offering a refuge from the ceaseless buzz of activity in the fortress. \n\nEven Wei Wuxian is diligent, exhibiting admirable discipline. He comments occasionally on their progress, or notes the state of some item he has found in disrepair, reporting each count faithfully to Lan Wangji, who inks it down with precision. It reminds Lan Wangji, strangely, of the cave, the few hours of collecting and unstringing bows, working in quiet companionship. An ease they rarely achieved in the library, Wei Wuxian too antsy, too full of talk most days, too keen on pranks and flirtation. \n\nLan Wangji would welcome that too, if there was chatter. There is a new stillness to Wei Wuxian that is equal parts pleasing and disturbing. Lan Wangji can recognize it—the kind of stillness borne from solitude. His restless energy hasn’t ceased, it has just been… channeled. Controlled, contained. \n\nThese long months that have passed, that Wei Wuxian will barely speak of—has he been alone? Has loneliness etched its way through him without his permission, the way a river carves a landscape? That amount of solitude would be difficult enough for Lan Wangji, who knows how to endure it. Depriving Wei Wuxian of talk, of simple daily companionship, would be like depriving him of air.\n\n“Lan Zhan, I’m done,” Wei Wuxian announces abruptly, in the middle of a column and a half-finished crate. He drops the lid closed and sits atop it, rolling the stiffness out of his shoulders. Testing Lan Wangji like he expects an objection. \n\nLan Wangji has none. He folds the logbook closed, laying the brush aside. From his sleeve, he unwraps a pair of steamed buns, tucked there for just such a purpose. He offers one to Wei Wuxian, who stares at him a long moment. Finally he accepts it, taking a bite, wiping off his hands on his robes.\n\n“Mmm,” he says begrudgingly, at the mild kick of spice, the best that Qinghe can do. “Guess you didn’t bring any wine.” \n\nHis eyes go comically wide as Lan Wangji produces that too. \n\n“We are not in Cloud Recesses,” Lan Wangji says stiffly, to the appalled shock in his gaze. \n\nWei Wuxian has already uncorked it, gulping down half of it, wiping his chin on his sleeve. “Hanguang-jun, what’s gotten into you? Next you’ll be courting me naked in public.”\n\nThe words drop like a stone to the bottom of a well. The silence echoes a moment, the torches shuddering along the walls. \n\nCarefully, awkwardly, they each step around the sentence. Wei Wuxian holds out the wine, a peace offering, then winces, withdrawing it before Lan Wangji can refuse it, shaking his head. “Right. Sorry,” he says softly. \n\nThere is nothing to do for a moment but finish their food in silence. They each swallow the last bites, Lan Wangji delicately, Wei Wuxian washing his down with another gulp of the wine. \n\n“When did you learn to play?” Lan Wangji asks. \n\nWei Wuxian blinks up at him. “Huh?” Surprise at the question followed by willingness to accept a change of subject. \n\n“The flute. When did you learn?”\n\nThat had been part of the shock in the courier station when Wei Wuxian reappeared. His exquisite prowess with the music. Lan Wangji, who has played the qin since he was five, lessons commencing before his small fingers could even span the strings, knows full well that one does not wake up overnight—nor return from the dead—with that level of skill. \n\n“Oh. Um. Never learned. Not formally,” Wei Wuxian adds quickly, as if sensing Lan Wangji’s distaste. He shrugs. “Just played around. Liked it, when I was young. Listened to others, played what I heard. Got better at it.”\n\nOf course Wei Wuxian did. Of course he didn’t endure years of rigorous discipline. Of course he just *liked* it, and taught himself for the pleasure of it, not caring if he excelled. \n\n“It was after I came to Lotus Pier,” Wei Wuxian elaborates. “Uncle Jiang said I got it from my mother, my knack with music. Said she was so clever, she could hear a song once and play it. She loved music. It made me feel…” He falters, his cheeks acquiring a little stain of color. As if he’s said more than he meant to, and feels exposed. \n\n“My—” Lan Wangji says, and has to swallow. “My mother also. Loved music.”\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThe silence has a softer, less difficult quality this time. Wei Wuxian reaches behind him and pauses, then draws out the flute from his belt. He rolls the lacquered finish in his fingers, looking at Lan Wangji for permission. \n\nLan Wangji nods.\n\nIt is haunting, the first note Wei Wuxian draws from the flute. Not like before—not foul, something that roils in the air like it belongs in a grave. There is no resentful energy with it. No wisp of dark smoke, no trace of spiritual power. Just a song that begins to curl through the air, beautiful. Spun like silk, like a spell, captivating, exquisite. A gleaming thread of tension runs through the melody like a river in the moonlight. \n\nLan Wangji takes an involuntary step forward. Wei Wuxian has his eyes closed, his lashes dark on his cheeks. Lan Wangji cannot do the same, cannot shut his eyes; he drifts in closer, as if summoned, his musician’s mind working to make sense of the notes. They tumble over each other, spilling forth from the flute, as the song shifts again, deepens. It grows moody. Seductive. Plaintive and yearning. It wraps tendrils around Lan Wangji like a creature that could drown him. \n\n“Did you write this?” Lan Wangji asks, when the last note wavers, winking out like a rushlight between them. It is like nothing he’s heard in Gusu, which is what Wei Wuxian always does to him. \n\nWei Wuxian shakes his head no. “It’s a Yunmeng love song,” he says. “I’ve heard it since I was a child.” He pauses, voice soft as he recalls the old story. “There are two lovers. They run away, and offend the immortals. As punishment, they are cursed, banished for eternity to opposite sides of the river. Every night, in the moonlight, they sing this song to each other, back and forth across the water.”\n\nThe torchlight flickers in the air.\n\n“Is that what we are?” Lan Wangji asks hoarsely. \n\n“Which?” Wei Wuxian says. “Lovers, or cursed?”\n\nIt is not gentle, the kiss. It is months of hunger, of need. Lan Wangji drags Wei Wuxian to the edge of the crate, bends him back across it. When they break off the kiss, Wei Wuxian runs his hands into Lan Wangji’s hair, and then buckles forward, burying his face in the crook of his neck. He just breathes there, a little raggedly, holding Lan Wangji to him and filling his lungs. As if this—his scent, his warmth, the taste and feel of his skin—is what Wei Wuxian has been deprived of. A need as elemental as sunlight, or air.\n\nLan Wangji has heard the difference between this song on the flute and the song he’s composed. His is wistful, naive, sweet stirrings of longing in an innocent heart. Friendship pledged; love desired. The fulfillment to be found in years of faithful companionship. A love song composed by someone who doesn’t know the first thing about love, in the body, the earthiness of it—the fire and the wild hunger of physical touch.\n\nThat’s what the kiss becomes again, slowly. It builds, the heat of it, the need. Wei Wuxian drags his hands all over Lan Wangji’s chest, down his back, parting his legs to catch Lan Wangji between them. Lan Wangji falls against him, almost sprawling them down on top of the crate. He is kissing urgently, breathlessly, needing air less than he needs Wei Wuxian pressed against him. All Wei Wuxian does is drag him closer, clutch him tighter, return the kiss with satisfying ferocity, evenly matched, even in this.\n\nA gate clanks open in the distance. Footsteps on the stone. For a wild, reckless moment they still kiss, pulling apart—Lan Wangji biting Wei Wuxian’s lip—a mere heartbeat before they can be discovered, the footsteps rounding the corner into the room. \n\nIt is one of Jiang Wanyin’s men. When he arrives, barely bowing, they are standing apart, Lan Wangji inspecting a nearby crate. “Clan leader Jiang wishes to speak with you,” the man says to Wei Wuxian, his manners glib, nearly insolent, for addressing a clan leader’s brother. Lan Wangji almost starts forward, stopping only when Wei Wuxian’s lazy voice gets there first. \n\n“Tomorrow,” he says, the glint of rebellion that makes him all edges, sharp as a blade. \n\nThe man begins to say something, deny him that choice. \n\n“Tomorrow,” Wei Wuxian states again, with finality. \n\nLan Wangji asserts his own authority, sweeping past the man without a glance or a word. Wei Wuxian follows, twirling the flute with blithe indifference until they are outside and he exhales, releasing a tension he hasn’t shown until it’s dark and they’re alone. \n\n“Wei Ying.”\n\n“No,” Wei Wuxian says, his voice a dozen different things. He shakes his head tiredly. “Don’t spoil it.”\n\nLan Wangji doesn’t. The night is quiet, outdoors. The fresh air pleasant on his skin. They cross the courtyard, bathed in silver, the moon reflected in the fountains. Idly strolling, no desire to reach the end of the evening. Drifting close enough their sleeves brush, no one around to observe.\n\nLan Wangji allows himself to wonder if there is something more to it, this soft and brimming silence, Wei Wuxian’s new willingness for it. Perhaps—perhaps some part of it isn’t only the strain of secrecy, or the aftermath of an ordeal. Perhaps Wei Wuxian is also revealing a different side of himself. Allowing Lan Wangji in, trusting him with a part of himself that he does not show the world. Absorbing Lan Wangji’s quiet, no need to shatter it like glass into pieces on the floor. \n\nThat’s what it feels like, in the moonlight, when they arrive back at Lan Wangji’s quarters. Wei Wuxian lingers, not eager to rush off towards his own. \n\nThere are deep shadows at the door. Lan Wangji takes his wrist, drawing them both into the shadows, hidden enough from view to kiss him again. \n\nIt isn’t full of heat, right away—not a resumption of the storeroom, not immediately leading to anything. It’s just connecting again, content with just this. Lan Wangji presses against him, Wei Wuxian’s hands running lightly over his back, drinking him in.\n\nLost in it, they barely hear when another set of footsteps approach. A passing guard, making his rounds. Wei Wuxian, instead of pulling apart, instinctively presses them deeper into the shadows, blocking the white of Lan Wangji’s robes with the black of his own. \n\nLan Wangji has never been the one pinned. Wei Wuxian had crowded around him in the Xuanwu Cave but that had been out of necessity, avoiding his injured leg. It’s different like this. His pulse spikes, hands dropping to rest at Wei Wuxian’s waist. The flute stings him, tucked in his belt. A strange jolt of sensation. Sharp but not unpleasant, like being flicked.\n\nPerversely, all it does is make him want Wei Wuxian more. Whatever he has done, whatever this dark power is, Lan Wangji *knows* it is wrong and that wrongness is not enough to keep him away. There’s a hunger just as dark within himself—like calling to like, the danger of it attracting him, not repelling him. The new Wei Wuxian, so very nearly the same as the old Wei Wuxian, wicked, ingenious, defiant to a fault, lays a kiss on his lips. \n\nLan Wangji opens up to him. It is deeper, slower, the kiss, out here in the dark. Heat prickles his spine, pools in his joints, gathers low in his belly—lower. He feels dangerously sober this time, nothing like the night Wei Wuxian made him drink liquor, or the heady exploration in the cave. For once in his life he knows exactly what he is doing and is doing it anyway. \n\n“Lan Zhan,” Wei Wuxian breathes, mouth on his neck again, nuzzling the spot where his pulse beats soft and frantic beneath his skin. \n\n“Wei Ying,” he whispers hoarsely, his grip so tight on Wei Wuxian’s arms he can feel the bone beneath muscle. \n\nWei Wuxian is unperturbed. He *likes* it, Lan Wangji realizes, knowledge that Lan Wangji does *not* need to have. Wei Wuxian is responding to it, teeth sinking down, tugging sharp, sweet, biting kisses up and down Lan Wangji’s throat until he abruptly groans at the ridiculous pattern repeating and pulls them apart. \n\nLan Xichen appears on the path. Lan Wangji, who could not hear his silent approach, feels like he has been caught naked in the moonlight. Lan Xichen looks startled too, a wrinkle he immediately smoothes out into a placid smile. \n\nWei Wuxian, with his superior instincts for self-preservation, stands respectfully apart from Lan Wangji, bowing. \n\n“Young Master Wei,” Lan Xichen greets him, nodding in return. \n\n*We were just—* An excuse tries to fight its way to the tip of Lan Wangji’s tongue. Before it can, Wei Wuxian simply says, “Lan Zhan, goodnight. Zewu-jun,” and bows again in farewell.\n\nThey both stand there watching as he slips away in the dark. Lan Xichen turns, casting his gaze at Lan Wangji again, who cannot meet it. At the top of the steps, Lan Xichen opens the door, light spilling out to meet him, and turns to look at Lan Wangji again. \n\nLan Wangji can *feel* when his gaze lands on the marks on his neck, the slight disorder of his collar, the hair that must be out of place. He musters so much dignity that he is almost indignant as he steps past his brother through the door. \n\n“Wangji,” Lan Xichen says, when they are both inside, doors firmly closed. \n\n“Brother,” Lan Wangji says formally, presenting a face of stone and a challenge. \n\nSomething shifts in Lan Xichen’s expression again, long-suffering and bewildered. He is tired enough to say the words without restraint: “I do not want to see you hurt.”\n\nLan Wangji is still off-balance enough to reply: “I do not want to see *him* hurt.”\n\nLan Xichen closes his eyes. There are new lines around them, etched there the past months and only visible when he is not presenting someone with the practiced serenity of his countenance. “If he has the Yin Iron, if he’s…”\n\n“He does not,” Lan Wangji says, weary enough himself that he ends the inquiry there, leaving Lan Xichen to stare after him as he abruptly departs for his side of their rooms. \n\nAt the qin, he sinks down, sitting there a long time without moving his hands, resting them across the strings. He picks out the melody in his head, note by note, over and over, working through it in silence until he is halfway confident it is faithful. It might even take half the night, but only when he knows which strings to pluck from beginning to end does he play the first note. \n\nA Yunmeng love song, more limpid when it was played on the flute. On the qin, it is solemn, more wistful—but then, everything Lan Wangji plays is. He hits a wrong note, finds the right one, reconstructing the strange tune from memory. Foreign to his fingers, a new thing, well beyond his realm of experience. \n\nHe can learn, though. He can expand his knowledge of this subject—of the world around him. Expand his knowledge of himself. \n\nHe half expects Wei Wuxian to appear, summoned like a spirit by the music, flashing a bright, hungry grin. Wei Wuxian does not, but he is somewhere nearby, within the walls of the fortress. \n\nLan Wangji plays, as he does often, as if it is a conversation. A call and response between them. As if Wei Wuxian could hear.\n\n---- \n\nNote: the story WWX mentions re: the love song is super loosely based on [the cowherd and the weaver] (Vega and Altair). That myth came to mind when I needed a pair of cursed lovers, but a) there’s no way LWJ wouldn’t know it already, and b) I wanted a song that would be a dark mirror to WuJi, so I took the liberty of imagining a more regional, sensual, folk song version of it that might have, say, sprung up around a river-dwelling clan, where the heavenly lovers and their celestial river gets echoed in the earthbound river itself. \n\nYou could do worse, though, than to imagine it as music set to [the poem of Qin Guan]:\n\n\u003e Through the varying shapes of the delicate clouds, the sad message of the shooting stars, a silent journey across the Milky Way. One meeting of the Cowherd and Weaver amidst the golden autumn wind and jade-glistening dew, eclipses the countless meetings in the mundane world. The feelings soft as water, the ecstatic moment unreal as a dream, how can one have the heart to go back on the bridge made of magpies? If the two hearts are united forever, why do the two persons need to stay together—day after day, night after night?","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/4-nightless-city":{"title":"Chapter 4 — Nightless City","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/5-phoenix-mountain":{"title":"Chapter 5 — Phoenix Mountain","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/6-burial-mounds":{"title":"Chapter 6 — Burial Mounds","content":"\n\u003e *In which of course Wei Wuxian has somehow acquired a child when he’s supposed to be busy raising armies of corpses.* \n---\n\nOne month. In that way, it’s easier this time—it was in Yiling where Wei Wuxian went missing before, presumed dead for three months, and now it has only been one. Not dead, not missing, but cut off from the cultivation world like an unwelcome limb.\n\nLan Wangji is with Xichen the day the letter arrives. Xichen unfolds it, reading in silence for several long minutes without changing his expression. \n\n“Brother,” Lan Wangji says, when he can stand it no longer. \n\nBrushwork that elegant, paper that fine; it can only be from Lanling. Xichen looks up, relaying Jin Guangyao’s account of how he has been working day and night in preparation for the wedding. \n\nThat is not Lan Wangji’s concern. “And?” he says. \n\nAn infinitesimal pause; an infinitesimal shake of his head. “He won’t be attending,” Xichen says. “They thought it prudent… not to inform him.”\n\nBirds flit in the autumn-bright branches around them, unaffected by the news, by the petty, bloodless cruelties humans will inflict on each other. *Not inform him.* It’s only the marriage of the person he loves most in the world. (To the person he despises most in the world.) Jiang Yanli is not behind this, of that at least Lan Wangji is certain. \n\n“He should know,” Lan Wangji says, trying to keep his voice neutral. \n\nXichen does not disagree. “But that is for his clan, and the Jins… it is not our place to say.” \n\nNot their place. The blood feud between the Jins and the Wen refugees—not their place. Cultivators killed, Wei Wuxian exiled—not their place. \n\n“Wangji,” Xichen says, warning. “It wouldn’t be wise, if you wrote to inform him.” \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji agrees. \n\n“Promise me that you won’t.” \n\n“Write to him? I won’t,” Lan Wangji says.\n\n---- \n\nYiling buzzes like a wasp’s nest. It’s almost comforting, really—Wei Wuxian must be nearby.\n\nThe intensity of the rumors, the wild distortions, are worse here than in Gusu. Yiling-laozhu, they’ve started calling him, the kind of puerile game one doesn’t always outgrow in childhood, creating monsters or villains in order to play the hero. Lan Wangji can only imagine how much Wei Wuxian is feeding these rumors himself, entertained by the tales. This isn’t supposed to be a *game.* \n\nEvery teahouse, every tavern, has a variation of the tale, each more outlandish than the last. Of course it’s not only that—other minor rumors and dramas still grip the populace too. But that’s what Lan Wangji’s ear is tuned for, and so that is what he hears. \n\nGhouls and demons—no, fierce corpses! *Armies* of the dead. Virgin orgies; infant sacrifices. *If anything, Wei Wuxian would not be that organized,* Lan Wangji thinks wryly, would tell anyone who would listen. \n\nNobody is interested in the truth. The lies that bother him most are the ones that most closely echo what was said in Jinlintai. Wei Wuxian is a traitor; Wei Wuxian is mediocre at best; if not for the mercy of the Jiangs he’d be on the streets where he belongs, and look what he’s done to repay them. \n\nOr—worst of all: someone like him doesn’t deserve to live.\n\nIt’s that last one that drives Lan Wangji out of the teahouse into Yiling’s bustling main street. The harsh glare of sunlight, stares from the crowd. A tiny, dusty child in brown robes who collides with Lan Wangji’s legs, depositing himself at his feet. \n\nLan Wangji stares down. The little boy clings like a limpet, a bright-eyed grin that says no one has taught him this is not a proper thing to do. “No…?” Lan Wangji says, afraid it comes out like a question. Of the two of them, he’s not the one who bursts into tears. \n\n---\n\n*This* is your fearsome Yiling-laozhu, Lan Wangji thinks more than once, once he is able to think. \n\nIt is a heartstopping sight, Wei Wuxian parting the crowds like the clouds that can’t hide the sun. Collecting the boy by the hand—because of course Wei Wuxian has somehow acquired a *child* when he’s supposed to be busy raising armies of corpses. Drying his tears, dusting his robes. Swordfighting with toys in the street, flying paper-winged butterflies, the two of them turning twin grins upon him like they are *trying* to stop Lan Wangji’s heart.\n\nThis is the Wei Wuxian he knows. The undimmed sunlight of him, none of the fury from Lanling, or the cold and miserable distance the last time he reappeared from the dead. He is changed—still, again—frighteningly thin and shabbily dressed—but the old goodness shines through him, scrubbed clean and unclouded, at ease with himself in a way that Lan Wangji has not seen in a very long time. \n\nHe feels mauled by it, this unexpected turn of events, so far outside his experience that all he can do is be himself, slightly stiff, slightly bitchy, warm all over when that’s the Lan Wangji these two accept unequivocally, delighted with him, laying claim to him as easily as they do with each other.","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/7-interregenum":{"title":"Chapter 7 — Interregenum","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-01-19T19:59:06.128086167Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/to-accept-what-must-be":{"title":"To Accept What Must Be","content":"\n[[private/cql/1 -
