Outstanding use of the cheesy amnesia trope, a worthy homage to _While You Were Sleeping_. (Sam is absolutely the English Sandra Bullock.)\n\nIt’s also laugh-out-loud funny, courtesy of Sam’s whole work family, Jonathan’s whole real family, and GOLLUM THE CAT.\n\nAnd let me pay this forward: do not miss the narration. I’ve actually read it thrice, because I got the paperback via preorder, but then my friend Meg convinced me I could not miss the audio. She was 100% correct. And then I started the audio again over the long Thanksgiving weekend when a little comfort was needed. As per usual with Alexis, there’s a lot of attention to dialect, and to hear Sam’s Liverpool voice brought to life makes the story. There’s a reason Will Watt has been winning awards for his performance, it’s perfection.\n\n(As if the cover isn’t a clue, the [[series/material world|Material World]] series shares a universe with [[series/london calling|London Calling]]. No offense to Luc, but Sam’s work gang nearly rivals the CRAPP crew.)","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.590907838Z","tags":[]},"/books/a-fashionable-indulgence":{"title":"A Fashionable Indulgence","content":"Ditto *[[books/a seditious affair|A Seditious Affair]]:* first read this years ago; out of order then in order; its politics are even more relevant now. There is a refreshing lack of drama between Harry and Julius—their conflict is external—and I greatly appreciate a romance with the guts to do that. Also, it plays out pretty much in tandem with _Seditious Affair_, so Dom falling apart in the background is like a basket full of easter eggs for those who know why.","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.590907838Z","tags":[]},"/books/a-gentlemans-position":{"title":"A Gentleman’s Position","content":"It’s the favorite recurring KJ Charles theme: sometimes you just need a villain instead of a hero. See *[[books/wanted a gentleman|Wanted, A Gentleman]]* or *[[books/the henchmen of zenda|Henchmen of Zenda]]*, et. al. My love language is elaborate schemes by crafty bastards, so you can guess how happy I was by the end. I wound up on Richard’s side too; that’s how well he was drawn, flaws and all, when normally my heart would belong solely to the aforementioned crafty bastard. (Also, Richard is 100% Matthew McFadyen circa _Howard’s End_, don’t @ me.)\n\nBack to the point: I love it when henchmen get their due.

(Often literally, as there is an outbreak of typhoid that infects the course of the story.)\n\nNo regrets for picking up this pretty little McNally Edition either, which, apart from the banging cover, is a tactile pleasure to hold. It’s my favorite trim size, more tall than wide, with generous line-height and margins, but not so much that it pads out the page count and makes you feel cheated.

The only character I adore more than Melville is Margaret; I’m in love with them both. The only note I would give is that I personally wished Eliza would have been delighted that %%Melville fooled her%%; I get why she’s not, but it would have been a refreshing twist if she was like, “ok, now we’re soulmates, well done,” even if she still made him pay for it. But that’s just me.\n\nThe whole ensemble cast is great. The banter is top-notch. If I elope with Margaret or Melville (or both!), don’t come for me, ’kay?\n\n\u003e “Did you just cut me direct?”  \n\u003e Eliza turned quickly, to find Melville standing directly before her, head cocked. Her mouth fell open in horror.  \n\u003e “I—ah—” she stammered, her face growing hot.  \n\u003e “You did!” he crowed, intrigued and delighted.\n\n(Also, if you’re going to illustrate a cover, that’s how to do it.)","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.590907838Z","tags":[]},"/books/a-marvellous-light":{"title":"A Marvellous Light","content":"Fun Edwardian murder mystery.

It’s so clever and so tender, wickedly funny and emotionally cathartic and full of dastardly-gothic-plots-with-a-twist. Everything with [[books/the secret lives of country gentlemen|the first book]] where I was like, I need to read the second book to know how I feel about it—yep.

And it needs the first book to be so sprawling with its cast, so lavish with its setting, because this one hones right in, a sharp, focused story that _needs_ the sprawling, rich tapestry in the background. A contrast, a balance, that in my opinion is expertly done.  \n  \nFurthermore, I hereby declare: fuck grand gestures for good. I want [Pat/Pran level tears](https://youtu.be/Bqe09a1xL3I?feature=shared\u0026t=723), sob-your-heart-out-and-all-I’m-gonna-do-is-hold-you emotional safety. If your romance can’t support that, is it even really a romance? Give me the intimacy and catharsis; nothing else will do.  \n  \n(It’s not really a spoiler to say KJC delivers exactly that too.)  \n  \nAdditional notes chock full of spoilers:  \n  \n- I am the opposite of upset at all the [[books/band sinister|Viscount Corvin]] treats throughout. Corvin! (Corvin, the “excellent man to be seduced by.” Corvin, his “relentless air of sexual availability.” Haaaahahaha.) Of course that’s who taught Luke what the wider, kinder world looks like. 🥹  \n  \n- Berengaria and Emily happening literally right under their oblivious doofus noses rivals even [[books/sugared game|the magnificent Maisie/Phoebe lack of subtlety/oblivion]] (there’s naked painting! come _on_)  \n  \n- Rufus’s reaction when he catches Luke lying and maybe cheating and stealing is everything to me, as is his eventual excitement at the truth. He’s such a scrupulously honest person, and yet his first thoughtless instincts are to, respectively, lie and bribe on Luke’s behalf, protecting him at all costs even in the midst of despair and betrayal, and then to exuberantly condone a treasure hunt. All of which in the context of things makes him more admirable, _more_ honest. That’s how to make my heart sing.  \n  \n- Once upon a time I said that _Jonathan: or The Struggles of Virtue_ is [[books/wanted a gentleman|the book-within-a-book]] I most wanted to read: its appearance here is the next best thing, in all its kinky gothic glory 🤣  \n  \n- Placing the power balance in Luke’s favor, where the cocky, clever, criminal secretary has arguably (and yes, they do debate it) the upperhand on an earldom—heck yes.  \n  \n- Turning Doomsday and its variations into endearments was honestly one of the things I felt the lack of in the first book. Like, how can you _not_ play with that name? I see why now, and am so glad KJC saved it for this book. Each little iteration of it—_you blasted apocalypse, that pestilent Doomsday, my End of Days_—is so brilliantly felt, so perfect in its context, that I wanna wallow around in it like Odo in the archives (i.e. like a pig in shit). (I’m sorry, Sir Gareth, for judging you for not doing the same.)  \n\n\u003e _“You really are well named, aren’t you?

Robin and Maud, respectively, were the most difficult parts of their own books for me. They’re just so young, energetic, athletic, upstanding, so shiny, so beautiful, so aggressively… “normal,” for lack of a better word, when I prefer crankiness and weariness and a bit of tarnish on the bronze these days.\n\nHere, their presence in the ensemble was a much better balance. Enough without too much.\n\nAnd that clears the decks for Jack, deeply scarred, and Alan, deeply insolent, to take center stage. In book 2, they’re stalking around each other and scrapping like alley cats in the background, and that dynamic ratchets up a few notches here, to my endless pleasure.\n\nIt’s the best of the trilogy, by a long shot. And/or it just hit every one of my preferences in a perfect way. The kinky power dynamics vs. real world politics. The class differences. The exquisite emotional development. %%The betrayal that is immediately understood and admired.%% Crackling tension and careful tenderness.\n\nComplexity galore, [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] style. At least for the romance—the fantasy still lagged a step behind the best KJC plotting. There were some WTF turns, but ultimately I really liked where it went, and Marske wrote to her strengths. For [[books/starling house|the second book I’ve read recently]], it upends the idea of a magic system dependent on bloodlines. I thought the metaphors and parallels of imperialism came together a lot better here than in the first two books—or maybe my expectations, by now, were just more in line with what Marske delivers. \n\nEither way, it was excellent, I would read it straightaway again. Just given my tastes, I had the highest hopes for this book out of the three, but was still surprised and pleased at how well it delivered.  \n  \nA few stray notes:  \n  \n- The whole Roman storyline was utter catnip for me: concept, commentary, and execution. Best inclusion of an erotica-novel plot [[books/a noblemans guide to seducing a scoundrel|since Jonathan: And The Struggles of Virtue]].  \n- Actually, come to think of it, a lot of what earned the five stars for *[[books/a noblemans guide to seducing a scoundrel|Nobleman’s Guide to Seducing a Scoundrel]]* was the same kind of thing that earned high marks from me here. What can I say, I’m predictable.\n- If Marske developed the idea for Alan’s powers just so she could drop the line “Master Perturbator”… NOTHING BUT RESPECT 😆\n- All the sniping back and forth that didn’t disappear but got more pointed as they grew closer… that’s the kind of delicious bite the first books were missing.\n- “It’s alarming that forgery is your first instinct,” he said, “but I admire it.” / “If the rules are stupid, sod the rules.” (See! KJC-style is more fun for everyone.)\n- I absolutely loved the %%Robin-Adelaide marriage%%. It felt like it came out of nowhere when they announced it, but I didn’t even care, I love how that got folded right into the happy ending.

SO CLOSE. But overall, the book felt kind of like the menagerie on board the ship, let loose in all directions, refusing to be corralled. There were some structure/plot/writing choices that left me more stumped than dazzled. Maud’s and Violet’s POV seemed really interchangeable for the first half, which is... not great when one is a supposedly scandalous, sardonic, shrewd actress and one is a sheltered, capricious, stubborn young girl.\n\nThe biggest gap in logic for me the whole time: they’re sending MAUD on this transatlantic mission of life and death importance? Who… checks notes… has no experience, no training, no actual qualifications other than being Robin’s sister, supposedly no magic…  \n\nJust… WHAT. Especially when they have Adelaide or others like her in the ministry who would be smashingly competent and trustworthy?\n\nI know Maud wanted adventure, but come on. That stressed me out.\n\nAnyway, I have another theory for why this series, despite some high points, has been rocky for me so far… book 3 will have to confirm or deny.

I hate to even say that, though—it was relevant three years ago, and 10 years ago, and 200 years ago, and will retain that continuity with both the past and the future. But the events of 1820 have a symmetry with the events of 2020, and while it’s disingenuous to claim that’s anything new, it’s why I found myself wanting—nay, needing?—to read this series again.

She’s willing to argue with the novel as much as we are, ready to poke holes in the perfection of this utopia—the idea of utopia at all—to allow in stinging insects and menstrual blood, men and boys who want to make war, girls who are restless with the sameness of Valley life, and grandmothers wrapped up in insane blood feuds. And don’t even get me started on the amazing audacity of creating a cassette tape of Kesh folk songs to go along with the first edition. I marvel, revel in this, the utter luxuriousness of watching a writer say yes to herself—the discipline she has to allow herself such freedom.\n\nI plan to take my time, reading slowly all month (all year?). Expect a travelogue of sorts to follow.\n\n---\n\nUrsula’s foreward, so fitting considering she did also translate the [[books/tao te ching|Tao te Ching]]: \n\n\u003e The difficulty of translation from a language that doesn’t yet exist is considerable, but there’s no need to exaggerate it. The past, after all, can be quite as obscure as the future. The ancient Chinese book called Tao teh ching has been translated into English dozens of times, and indeed the Chinese have to keep retranslating it into Chinese at every cycle of Cathay, but no translation can give us the book that Lao Tze (who may not have existed) wrote. All we have is the Tao teh ching that is here, now. And so with translations from a literature of the (or a) future. The fact that it hasn’t yet been written, the mere absence of a text to translate, doesn’t make all that much difference. What was and what may be lie, like children whose faces we cannot see, in the arms of silence.

We naturally turn towards the bookshop.”_\n\nWhere do I begin? What is this book about? Books, yes. A love of books and of libraries. Books as lifeline and language. It’s about a girl growing up, and witches and fairies and boarding schools and grief and Wales and loneliness even amongst those with whom you might belong. It’s the boundary between the real and unreal, magic and the mundane, what it means to have power and sometimes no power at all.\n\nBut what I really love about it is the in-betweenness of it all. It begins where most books would end, after a battle between good and evil which Mori has lost. (Alternately, for this book is full of alternatelys, it’s after Mori is exiled to her estranged father because her mother has gone mad and her sister has died and Mori nearly died herself.) And it ends— not with falling in love, coming of age, or finding where she belongs, but simply filling in another page.\n\nYou can see Mori’s full arc—the adult she’ll become because of the child she’s been—but it’s between the lines. She’s still stuck in between. It’s her adolescence, literally. The cusp, the not-there-yet. She meets a boy, and he’s beautiful and reads Heinlein, but he’s a friend, a right-now, not a soulmate or savior. She faces her mother at last, but it’s not redemption so much as an anticlimax. She makes an effort with her father, but it doesn’t solve their relationship. An ad-hoc [[notes/karass|karass]] still isn’t where she belongs.\n\nIt’s the experience of being fifteen. The power you may or may not have; the responsibility of it. The untrustworthy world, which seems to both hang on your actions and operate without you at all. It’s remarkably clever, this book, where the magic is simply the natural order of things. A bus on time or not; anything that can be denied.\n\nAnd I’m still describing it poorly because this is Jo Walton. It’s not a kid’s book, or a coming of age. It’s not even the science fiction or fantasy that Mori adores. It’s a story, a good one, and it plays with the concept of story itself. Books are Mori’s language. It’s how she communicates, and you see her just dying for someone to listen and then speak the same language. When they do, even imperfectly, it’s on the scale of another book’s grand revelation.\n\nI love her odd little heart. I understand the way her mind works; it’s not unlike my own. I still feel the craving for people who speak the same language, and there’s hope they exist. This is one of those books you can read all kinds of ways because you participate in the story. There are layers and layers. It gives you what you bring to it. And it’s like Mori says, if you love a book enough, the book will love you back.","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.590907838Z","tags":[]},"/books/annals-of-the-former-world":{"title":"Annals of the Former World","content":"\nI’m glad I’m not beyond the age where books I read can change the way I see the world.

I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.  \n  \nThis was McPhee making a study of that place where language and the earth overlap. Beyond excellent.\n\nNote: this book compiles four different previously published titles: *Basin and Range* (1981), *In Suspect Terrain* (1983), *Rising from the Plains* (1986), and *Assembling California* (1992).\n\nThis description of *Basin and Range* applies to all of it:\n\n\u003e This stretching and folding of language, by which the geologist does to words what endless eons have done to his rocks, excites Mr. McPhee to language experiments of his own. In “Basin and Range,” he is not so much a visiting amateur as a rhapsodist of “[[notes/deep time|deep time]]” like Montaigne, who, centuries before James Hutton, celebrated the mind-stretching eons of change: “The world is but a perennial movement. All things in it are in constant motion—the earth, the rocks of the Caucasus, the pyramids of Egypt—both with the common motion and with their own. Stability itself is nothing but a more languid motion. I cannot keep my subject still. It goes along befuddled and staggering, with a natural drunkness.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Montaigne is a fitting companion for Mr. McPhee, who has the same sort of miscellaneous temperament, the same fascination with odd bits of knowledge. Whether Mr. McPhee writes about bark canoes, the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the Alaskan wilderness or now the “Big Picture” of America's geological history, he is offering us an oddly angled portrait of his own mind, an autobiography made up of shards and pieces, evoked in crisp adventurous prose. And the adventure finally is in the prose. In “Basin and Range” the perspectives and expertise of geology become a language for the drama of time. The result is a fascinating book.[^1]\n\n\n[^1]: [Rhapsodist of Deep Time, Paul Zweig, the New York Times Archives](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/books/rhapsodist-of-deep-time.html)\n","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.590907838Z","tags":[]},"/books/any-old-diamonds":{"title":"Any Old Diamonds","content":"[As KJC says](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2602050279): In which we stick it to a duke. \n\nWhat *[[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]]* was to 2018, _Any Old Diamonds_ is to 2019.

It’s an emotion that we often experience when we fail to set boundaries or ask for what we need, or when expectations let us down because they were based on things we can’t control, like what other people think, what they feel, or how they’re going to react.\n\n\u003e I think it’s important to point out, especially in this political and social climate, that when we feel relieved, grateful, or even happy that someone who has done something hurtful, unethical, or unjust is held accountable, that’s not schadenfreude and normally doesn’t stem from counter-empathy. On the contrary, it can stem from empathy for the aggrieved. It’s similar to the distinction that when we hold someone accountable and they respond to that accountability by feeling shame, it does not mean we’ve shamed them.\n\n\u003e SPOILER ALERT: I’m pretty sure this research explains why I do not like surprises. I’m not a fan of having to manage amplified emotion while in the spotlight. But it’s not just my introversion and the spotlight piece, I don’t like surprises in movies or TV series either. I know many of y’all will find this egregious, but I normally read the entire plot of any potentially stressful movie before I watch it. People assume that ruins it for me, but it doesn’t. I can actually enjoy it better without being thrown off the surprise bridge into amplified emotion. No, thank you.\n\n\u003e “Each person’s grief is as unique as their fingerprint. But what everyone has in common is that no matter how they grieve, they share a need for their grief to be witnessed.\n\u003e That doesn’t mean needing someone to try to lessen it or reframe it for them. The need is for someone to be fully present to the magnitude of their loss without trying to point out the silver lining.” (David Kessler)\n\n\u003e Re: compassion vs. empathy: It’s an important debate that is frustratingly hijacked on occasion by folks who come up with new, arbitrary definitions for emotions that are completely different from how we all use the terms. They change the meaning, then argue that the emotion is “bad” based on their new definitions. For example, someone might say that empathy is taking on all the feelings of another person, then argue that empathy is bad. Unfortunately, this approach is often misleading and self-serving and puts no value on how we use the word. I would argue that a lot of this linguistic shell-gaming is about wanting to be contrarian. There’s nothing more seductive and clickable than a discovery that something we believe to be good is bad: “Empathy is bad for you.” cf. [[Humankind: A Hopeful History]]\n\n\u003e Researcher Matthew Kuan Johnson explains that people find experiences of joy difficult to articulate. He hypothesizes that the very nature of joy pushes the boundaries of our ability to communicate about lived experience via spoken language. ==He also suggests that because language can shape lived experience, cultures that have more words to describe the emotion of joy may also experience joy more richly.==\n\n\u003e “Tranquil environments” provide many restorative elements that are needed to counter mental fatigue and attention depletion. Researchers Rachel and Stephen Kaplan found that there are four essential elements of a restorative environment: a sense of getting away, a feeling of immersion, holding attention without effort, and compatibility with one’s preferences.\n\n\u003e When we lose our tolerance for vulnerability, joy becomes foreboding. No emotion is more frightening than joy, because we believe if we allow ourselves to feel joy, we are inviting disaster. We start dress-rehearsing tragedy in the best moments of our lives in order to stop vulnerability from beating us to the punch. We are terrified of being blindsided by pain, so we practice tragedy and trauma. But there’s a huge cost.\n\n\u003e Anger is a catalyst. Holding on to it will make us exhausted and sick. It’s an emotion that we need to transform into something life-giving: courage, love, change, compassion, justice.\n\u003e Or sometimes anger can mask a far more difficult emotion like grief, regret, or shame, and we need to use it to dig into what we’re really feeling.

Ruth, an autistic devout Christian on the cusp of adulthood, begins to realize everything in her life is not as it seems, not even herself. Cue the horror of religious trauma and conversion therapy camps, right at home with the traditional trappings of the horror genre. It gets genuinely creepy as hell as all hell is unleashed, quite literally in the case of demons run amok. (I could see where some readers would take issue that Chuck chose to make the demons real, and hell real, but that worked for me in the context of this book. Especially with the revelation of who the real monsters are, and that the demons are unwilling accomplices, ready to turn on their masters for what they’ve been forced to do.)\n\nI wish I didn’t have such a long list of conversion therapy survival books,[^1] but this is a worthy addition—maybe even the pinnacle.

The prose (and/or translation?) is more functional than beautiful on a sentence level, but on a plot level, with the overall character arcs, QJMX has some mad skill. Especially when she was writing as she went, chapter by chapter, serial style. (Says me, who can’t plot my way out of a paper bag.)\n\nEvery time I thought we’d reached a point where it was going to drag, nope, there’s a twist, a plot development, a time skip. Never a dull moment, which is more than I can say for most 100-page books, much less any clocking in at this massive length.\n\nOf course it helps that I go nuts for complex court politics played out at this scale. And morally gray (to put it kindly) heroines.\n\nA few more thoughts in list form:\n\n- If you’re gonna do a romance where one (nearly both) of the protagonists is underage at the beginning, then a 20-year timespan to get to the happy ending, with a complete flip of power balance, is the right choice to make.\n- Hurrah! It does the thing I love where obtaining the throne is not the happy ending—it’s detrimental to the happy ending, a problem to be solved.\n- The way the stress ruins Qi Yan’s health is so much more relatable and weirdly gratifying than the superhero protagonists who sail through plots unscathed.\n- There’s an absolutely bonkers side plot where QY %%offs a lecherous prince by kidnapping the young man he’s been aggressively harassing, drugging the young man, covering him in a poison that interacts with the liquor in the prince’s system (he’s an alcoholic) and makes the prince drop dead at first kiss.%% It’s non-con as hell, but the groundwork was laid for it, it’s a two-birds-one-stone solution to a problem, and I was so far into the suspended reality of the book that I was equally impressed and appalled by the creativity. 😆\n- After the following, I’m also impressed with how grounded and intimate a lot of the biggest reveals were. I was braced for melodrama, and it just didn’t go there as often as I expected. Bonkers spy plots but then real and honest conversations, just the way I like it.\n- At one point it was about wide-scale famine and grain storage and the intricate economics of a refugee crisis and that’s the kind of stuff I’ll eat up with spoon.\n- Note: I read the translation by [@meltsmelts](https://jwqs.carrd.co/) which I think got licensed for publication when I was in the home stretch, the last 50 chapters. I was hustling lest it get ripped out of my grubby hands. I think it’s still up for now, but heads up that the official publication should be coming soon.\n---\n## Reading Progress\n\nI rarely do status updates as I go, but JWQS called for it and I wanted to preserve these from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6038954581): \n\n- **10%** My brain: it’s December, let’s just read short, fluffy books the rest of the year / Also my brain: but what about this 300+ chapter wuxia[^1] novel tho? 😍😍\n- **14%** The part where the physician tells Qi Yan, “you’ve been through a lot, you’re overstressed, you should rest and recuperate for 3–5 years.” 😭 IF ONLY\n- **40%** I will never understand why I despise imperialism and am anti-monarchy to the bone yet gobble up a court intrigue like candy. Screw your hereditary titles and immoral wealth, but gimme alllll the conspiring and backstabbing and ultra complicated politics. What can I say! I am vast! I contain multitudes!\n- **48%** This kept me up wayyy past my bedtime last night. “Just one more chapter!” is so dangerous when there’s hundreds to go\n- **69%** You know it’s good slow burn when it’s 212 chapters in and I am filled with glee instead of fury 🔥🔥 (Qi Yan just POISONED HERSELF to take out a rival, we are not in boredom territory)\n- **81%** The inevitable exposing of Qi Yan’s identity is going the way I hoped it would. Not melodramatic but quiet and personal and intensely emotional. Particularly Jingnu’s reaction, and her instinctive loyalty. 😭 \n- **97%** This had me on my feet and pacing last night, I could not sit still with the plot twists. And that’s with knowing we’re fully in HEA territory too 🫢 (QIAN TONG, BOSS MOVE)\n\n[^1]: Note: I was mistaken when I called it wuxia. It’s a historical c-novel, but it’s more about court intrigue than martial arts and there’s no cultivation.

If you see someone as a monster, it is as good as attaching a real horn to them and poking them with a hot metal poker. I really do think so. In order to avoid turning people into monsters by suspecting them of being monsters, I do my best to keep myself mostly to myself.\n\n\u003e They have so much *energy*, Ursula’s people.

The society of theft-by-accusation. \n\n\u003e Anyone who takes gentle care of a cow is someone I trust. It’s a more telling characteristic of a person than taking Communion. Certainly more telling than good teeth. Every cow has a secret name that you can discover if you spend enough time with the creature, if you present yourself as open to learning the secret name. There are a number of methods. The one I use I came across by chance as a child, when I was regularly the first person to the animals in the morning, bringing them branches and feed.\n\n\u003e I had loved babies as a child, more than most people do, even. I loved their small fingernails. I loved the way they seemed to arrive older than their parents. I loved the courage they had to sleep as if there were no wolves, no soldiers.\n\n\u003e I am astonished at all the expense and effort given to the useless work of books. Each party forbids the books of the other party. It’s a vanity. Hans tells me his books can be bought even in Rome, he says it proudly, and, sure, I see that. He also says the bookseller has to hide the books under the counter and offer them only to those who know to ask—the books are mistresses. The men brag about them. Another realm for snobbery. And recklessness. I suspect the only thing I would be interested in reading would be a history. But I’m told histories are hated, which is not surprising. People prefer to make it up themselves.\n\n\u003e Hearts and alliances shift all the time, for reasons no better than the weather.\n\n\u003e And that was that. I trusted him, because he told me that the seeds of the butterblume delphinium are the swiftest cure for lice, even as the same seeds fermented in honey water can be a poison if used too often on the gums, or for epilepsy. He saw delphinium as I saw delphinium. As a plant capable of good and evil both. As a plant that required the knowledge and good intentions of man.\n\n\u003e I’m always polite to them, Greta. You’re right that we have to see the good in people, at least in people who have power over us and who will be angry if we see them in another way.\n\n\u003e His defense poured over me like used cooking grease.

This should not come as a surprise, because women in general and mothers in particular are required over and over again, under a wide range of circumstances, to put themselves aside, to forget.”\n\n## Motherhood: role or relationship?\n\nDonath argues a distinction between roles and relationships: as long as we frame motherhood as a role, with a rigid set of expectations that mothers are just implicitly expected to be good at, rather than an ever-evolving relationship that flows between mother and child and mother and all the other relationships she has in her life, we limit the emotional reactions mothers are allowed to have to their experiences as mothers and we limit the ways mothers can relate to their lives generally.\n\nSocietally, we’re used to and accept people who regret their marriages because we view that as a relationship between two people. But as long as we keep MOTHER as a role in capital letters, we’re going to keep suffering.\n\nThis is really the crux of the research—by restricting women to roles we refuse to get to know them as individual people. Where would we be if we told the truth to each other, and ourselves?\n\n## Category violation\n\n\u003e “If we realize that part of being a subject is to make calculations and weigh one’s options about what is valuable and worthwhile for one’s own life, then we can understand the wider meanings of the social expectations that mothers will not weigh their options and make evaluations regarding their motherhood. In other words, the social reaction to regret as a horrifying rationality demonstrates how mothers are deprived of their right to stay connected to their own understandings and, experiences and the intimate relationships in which they are involved. They cannot even pause for a minute to assess the state of their motherhood and their own lives, because ==it is too frightening to society – which depends upon mothers as objects who exist for the sake of others –when they do not stay put as such.==”\n\nVery very closely linked to the moral panics about queer sexuality, gender, etc. etc. In a hierarchal society violations of category cannot be tolerated, because the existence of the hierarchy depends on the enforcement of the categories.\n\n\u003e Since the nineteenth century, nationalist, capitalist, heteronormative, and patriarchal ideologies have joined hands to sustain this gendered division of labor — because without women’s unpaid labor as mothers and homemakers, the system would fall apart - while stressing that this division is ‘natural,’ and therefore eternal.\n\nIf they are so natural and eternal, why would they have to be vigilantly policed and enforced?\n## The ultimate taboo\n\nEven as some of our categories get more fluid or roles get reevaluated, it is still the ultimate taboo in society, women who regret becoming mothers. Yes, women can have careers, but they MUST be moms. Yes, women can be gay, but they MUST be moms. And they must WANT to be moms.\n\nOur social structure relies on the silencing of women who do not want to be mothers, or who regret becoming mothers. ==The status quo subjugation of women is reliant on women being denied emotional agency to feel however they feel about their lives and circumstances.==\n\nHow do we change the conversation? By telling the truth about the experiences that ALL women have, in all the diversity of our needs, yearnings, dreams, and realities.\n\nThe worst thing that we can do for mothers and children alike is pretend that there is one clear path for everyone.\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e When it comes to reproduction and the transition to motherhood, it is crucial to cast doubt on this rhetoric of all-embracing choice: how much room to maneuver do women actually have if we are free to choose only _what society wants us to choose?_\n\n\u003e The statement ‘I love my children but regret my motherhood’ is very often seen as impossible by definition — because doesn’t a wish to erase motherhood mean a wish to erase those children she loves? Yet a statement such as ‘I love him, but I regret I ever met him’ following a painful romantic relationship would hardly be considered paradoxical. In other words, it may be the sacredness we have placed on motherhood that prevents us from accepting that a woman can both love _and_ acknowledge the broader implications of that love in her life.\n\n\u003e On one hand, facing them [the accounts of regretted motherhood] may have torturous consequences; on the other hand, avoiding them may prevent us from understanding social worlds and changing them for the benefit of those who suffer from them. With this in mind, I believe the question ‘Why talk about regretting motherhood?’ should be flipped the other way around: What are the consequences of silencing regret over motherhood? Who pays the price when we try to pretend it does not exist?","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.630907985Z","tags":[]},"/books/reputation":{"title":"Reputation","content":"Lex Croucher’s lols-per-page cannot be beat.\n\nWeirdly, the only character I was meh on was the love interest, just because he’s _too_ perfect.

We’re starting to see the books written during the pandemic where authors are writing what they WANT, not what they SHOULD. It happened here, it happened with *[[books/delilah green doesn't care|Delilah Green]]*—it’s a joy and it changes the shape of the story in ways I want to see more of. \n\n2. Valentine with the slow realization he’s the villain of his own story is such a necessary twist, and one I hope we see more of, especially in historical fiction, especially with dukes.\n\n3. The way Alexis Hall removes the obstacles he’s set up to the romance is a deft touch and perfect in a queer book that has to invent its own happy ending. Most if not all of them are in Valentine’s head, and doing away with them involves listening instead of making assumptions + rethinking what’s possible outside the chokehold of convention.\n\n4. The JOY in this book. It’s one bananas gothic trope after another, and it’s riffing on the joy and power of stories, the way they save our lives. See again: pandemic fiction. ♥️\n\n5. I wrote a post recently about what it feels like to find out there’s a word for what you are and that others like you exist, and Valentine—his chaotic distress, indignant grief, baffled anger, and disorienting joy—might be the most relatable portrayal I’ve read yet. (Well, except for all the parts where he’s going, but I AM A DUKE.)\n\n\u003e _“Nobody told me it was a possibility.” Valentine suddenly discovered he was quite aggrieved. “Why has this never been brought to my attention?”_ \n\nSo yes, that made the book very very special to me, with whole pages I wanted to tear out and curl up with like blankets.

And I realized, I still hadn’t come up with words to talk about it yet, how the first two books of the series encapsulate 2020 for me in a specific and uncanny way, a century past the series’ historical setting, the same kinds of stresses and shifts going on in the world, and now the third installment does the same with 2021. \n\nIt IS the 2021 mood for me, in so many respects. Okay, but not okay. Out of the woods, but not yet. Boredom, but chaos. One day at a time. The ground not exactly steady under anyone’s feet. \n\nBut also the glimmer of sunlight a long way down the tunnel. The cracks and the fissures. The exhale. The shift.

It’s one of the versions that blur the language into dullness and vagueness, she says. “Lao Tzu is tough-minded. He is tender-minded. He is never, under any circumstances, squashy-minded. By confusing mysticism with imprecision, such versions betray the spirit of the book and its marvelously pungent, laconic, beautiful language.”\n\nIndeed.","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.634908001Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-adventures-of-amina-al-sirafi":{"title":"The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi","content":"A rollicking pirate adventure AND an extensive bibliography for the historical accuracies!

Basically, it is total innocence. ==Cyclists do not dope out of calculation or to make a career: those reasons only come afterward. They dope gratuitously, they do it because it is good.== Because to ride that fast is such a wonderful experience that it makes caution irrelevant. Such a great experience that you would give your life to go through it again. That is what I forgive them for and even what makes them so pure in my opinion. They are only looking for another taste of singular delights. Nothing was planned. After their first rides, they went from surprise to surprise.

I’d add C. Thi Nguyen’s [[notes/playfulness vs epistemic traps|playfulness vs epistemic traps]] too. \n\nA concept I am utterly on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says vastly more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question. \n\nFor example: in trying to locate the so-called “agricultural revolution,” we look only for the traits we expect and overlook anything that doesn’t conform. We’re not looking for play, or seasonal variations of social structures, or the essential involvement of women, so that has been left out of the story. \n\nWe need to approach the evidence of the human past with fresh eyes. Read nonfiction as fiction. Are there not more interesting and important questions we could be asking?\n\n* Even Rousseau and Hobbes is like having a Garden of Eden, there was once some “original state” more natural than the rest \n* A false premise, a false binary—helpful once upon a time to shake out some older ideas, but now it’s getting us nowhere\n* “Inequality” is almost a fatalistic acceptance, some condition that can only be tweaked instead of ended (kings or governments can be overthrown, a vague notion cannot)\n* We imagine people in the past to be more dumb/“primitive” than we are\n* Europe got their form of government from China\n\n\u003e This is not, then, a book about the origins of inequality. But it aims to answer many of the same questions in a different way. There is no doubt that something has gone terribly wrong with the world. A very small percentage of its population do control the fates of almost everyone else, and they are doing it in an increasingly disastrous fashion. To understand how this situation came about, we should trace the problem back to what first made possible the emergence of kings, priests, overseers and judges. But we no longer have the luxury of assuming we already know in advance what the precise answers will turn out to be.\n\n* This different view of the past is basically [[Science fictional behavior]]\n* The myth of the agricultural revolution \n* Seasonal variations of social structure  (reminds me of seasonal gender in [[books/the left hand of darkness]]\n* Also seasonal flooding with flood retreat farming (cf. [[notes/seasonal time|seasonal time]], [[notes/taoism|Taoism]])\n* schismogenesis\n* Many rebuttals to Yuval Harari (debunking Harari, Jared Diamond, as well as Rousseau)\n* When we tell these stories of losses of primordial innocence, women get written out of the picture (cf. [[notes/the carrier bag theory of fiction|The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction]])\n\n\u003e Instead of fixed fields, they exploited alluvial soils on the margins of lakes and springs, which shifted location from year to year. Instead of hewing wood, tilling fields and carrying water, they found ways of ‘persuading’ nature to do much of this labour for them. Theirs was not a science of domination and classification, but one of bending and coaxing, nurturing and cajoling, or even tricking the forces of nature, to increase the likelihood of securing a favourable outcome. Their ‘laboratory’ was the real world of plants and animals, whose innate tendencies they exploited through close observation and experimentation. This Neolithic mode of cultivation was, moreover, highly successful.\n\n* History’s first city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the environment, or on each other\n* I was keeping an eye out for Alfred Kroeber’s work (it’s there, first referenced on page 199, the 378!), but they do me one further and cite Le Guin herself, specifically ‘The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas’. \n\n## Rebuttals\n\nSome thoughtful pushback [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4614842121), among others.\n\nHowever, a lot of the negative reviews seem to want a new level of certainty, backed up by Facts™, and I can’t help but think that’s missing the point of the book.

She shows how debility, disability, and capacity together constitute an assemblage that states use to control populations. Puar’s analysis culminates in an interrogation of Israel’s policies toward Palestine, in which she outlines how Israel brings Palestinians into biopolitical being by designating them available for injury. Supplementing its right to kill with what Puar calls the right to maim, the Israeli state relies on liberal frameworks of disability to obscure and enable the mass debilitation of Palestinian bodies.

It’s an effort to stay grounded in it.\n\n\u003eCloser to home, the Luriati hinterlands are sick with violence; he learns slowly to read between the headlines, to understand that a riot is a pogrom, and that when a monk of the Path Behind is on TV calling for peace from both sides, that it means that the Path Behind is once again attempting to cull the hinterlands of the pathless, and of the races and castes that they consider low and other: his father’s legacy conjoined with the droppings of imperial Alab. Too, he learns there is plague abroad in the distant southeastern subcontinent of Aggiopa, where all those empire-builders came from, endlessly infecting and re-infecting the world. Fetter isn’t ready to grapple with a world so enlarged, so bloated from pain.\n\n\u003e It is obvious that they fear infection, but infection by disease or ideas or identities?\n\n\u003e In its own way, it is the perfect distillation of everything that is good about Luriat; the freedoms it gives, to those allowed to accept them; the space it creates for its citizens to make, to see, to hear, to be art, if they so desire and as long as that art does not cross the invisible lines of force that would bring down the boots and the drums.\n\n\u003e They were a cult, the first cult we had ever known, and we had no defenses against them. They infected us with strange ideas from the south-west. They brought doctrines of shame and disgust for the body and the glorification of the perfected mind. They asked us to look at our bodies not as the clean and perfect instruments of living that we had known, but as bags of flesh containing the thirty-one parts of impurity: the hairs of the head and the body; the nails and the teeth; the skin, flesh, and tendons; the bones and marrow; the heart, liver, and kidneys; the lungs, pleurae, and spleen; the intestines large and small—the shit and undigested food; the bile, phlegm, and pus; the blood, sweat, and tears; the fat, sebum, and spit; the mucus, the synovial fluid, the piss. They asked us to reflect on this and be repulsed: is the body not disgusting?\n\u003e \n\u003e Like this, they brought endless categorizations and subcategorizations and enumerations of being and experience. They brought, almost incidentally, the politics they knew, of centralization, of the consolidation of power, a politics of thrones.\n\n\u003e No one in this group is entirely present, not even Fetter. Everyone is neck-deep in plot, entangled in things that are too complicated to even talk about.\n\n\u003e They are all unchosen too; it’s just that the degree of their unchoosing is greater because they were never almost-chosen. Perhaps that distinction is finer than he’d thought. It means there’s no such thing as ordinary people.\n\n\u003e Fame, she says, is how a ruling class conditions artists to docility and incorporates their work to lesser ends. Sedition, unrest, and even revolution are useful to political actors currently out of power.\n\n\u003e Fetter himself thinks of the law less as strategic or rule-based and more as a muddled, dangerous beast. A rabid leopard, like Caduv’s character in the play. None of the others understand that the law might do anything, at any time, to anyone, and justify itself any way it likes—it is feral, like the invisible laws and powers of the world of which it is a pale imitation. It’s because none of them can see the devils, he thinks. That’s why they’re all so optimistic about worldly law.\n\n\u003e This is how the thought comes at him; sidelong, clinging to the back of another thought like a tick, or a child.\n\n\u003e He thinks of Hej and he aches. He thinks of Hej’s face, his smile, his hands, the low burr of his voice, the scratching of his beard. He aches, but there is also a low shameful breathing out, release, relief. All those lies of omission, all the secrets he’s kept; he can let go of that guilt from never opening up, never sharing his truth, never loving more than he feared.\n\n\u003e There is a reason the older term for devils is invisible laws and powers, Fetter reminds himself. Mother-of-Glory taught him this, and he’s seen it in his reading, deep in the heart of abstruse footnotes. The devils are not a people or a species. They don’t groom or fuck or fight or die. They may not be alive, or even truly be a them, as he understands the theory, not beings with a consciousness or sense of self that a mortal would recognize. They are principles of the world’s operation. They are gears and wheels; they are interlocking, grinding teeth. Or so it is supposed, at the most sophisticated level of mortal thought that he has ever encountered. There is no telling if this is any more or less true than the childhood terror of monsters that they still evoke in him.\n\n\u003e Even manipulation would speak of a kind of care that’s absent in this room. They don’t care, because the outcome of this room is already decided.\n\n\u003e …the no-time of this no-place. The discrete tick tock of timepass becomes a liquid gurgle, as if he is submerged in the unending flow of a river in which the boundaries between objects dissolve into a slurry that passes into silt through his hands.\n\n\u003e But is there such a thing as a type of devil? Isn’t that more race science? Isn’t it just a simplifying habit of thought, no different from the pervasive Luriati nonsense of higher and lower types? Perhaps, he thinks, peering carefully into the murk, every devil is unique and that they sometimes look like each other only reflects that they are kin. What difference does it make, when the devil is in the water at his feet?\n\n\u003e Fetter finds it within him to roll his eyes. “This isn’t death magic,” he says. “Filling in fucking citizenship forms in post-Occupation Luriat is death magic. This is just … doctoring.”\n\n\u003e “You already have a Saint-General and a Saint-Errant,” Fetter says, at last. “Aren’t they a matched set? Order and disorder—don’t they cover all eventualities between them?”\n\n\u003e Status is a rainbow on a proud soap bubble, inflated to its uttermost.\n\n\u003e Rulers love to submit, and the Path has always paid too much attention to thrones and not enough to people.\n\n\u003e “You make the same mistake again and again,” Ordinary says. “The sin of metonymy. I say people and you hear the people. I say power and you think of thrones and parliaments.”\n\n\u003e What is it that comes out of the Embassy’s bright door? Fetter never describes it clearly when he tells this story later, leaving his hearers to imagine a legendary monster. Monstrousness seems demanded by the mayhem. Some horrific and misshapen creature, twisted and ferocious, with invisible tentacles and claws and mandibles. Rumour will draw on old hinterlander stories to speak of devils, imaginatively extravagant because nobody knows what devils look like. The news will report it as malign foreign influences. Neither will make reference to bright doors at all.\n\n \u003eI hoped to build a systematic engine for the salvation of billions, but at this point, the Path Above is essentially a massive umbrella coalition of imitation poperies, strange cults, and personal development seminars, dispersed across a wide territory.\n \n \u003e I’m taking Fetter’s part. It’s my oldest habit, to confuse him with myself. A shadow’s duty, perhaps, but I am not him, I remind myself as I have reminded myself since we were children. I am the Unfettered. Someday, I will earn that name in truth.\n \n \u003e I could never hide unseen in the brain of the Perfect and Kind, which he prizes and holds up to the light of self-observation, but in his despised and forgotten gonads there is shadow enough.\n \n \u003e “So much for destiny,” Koel says, offering a wry little laugh that invites Fetter to join in. But he doesn’t.\n \u003e \n \u003e “The only way to change the world,” Fetter says, as if disagreeing with the part he doesn’t speak out loud.\n \u003e \n \u003e “You’re not going to give me some individualist shit about personal growth?” Koel says. “Change yourself to change the world? Something you learned while meditating upon the mysteries of your own ass.”","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.634908001Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-secret-lives-of-country-gentlemen":{"title":"The Secret Lives of Country Gentlemen","content":"Update: Yep.

But the GREENTEETH!\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e Another fairy might have played up their status as exiled healer, demanded special treatment and catering to their every whim. But Toadling tried to be helpful and stammered when she was nervous and had beautiful, worried eyes in a homely face. Her transformation into a toad was shocking, true, but it did not involve any inside-out bits or explosions, and she was such a small, inoffensive toad and such a small, inoffensive human, and she went out of her way to change behind buildings and things where people would not see it and be troubled by it. \n\n\u003e Thorns die from the inside out, like priests\n\n\u003e “Can you kill her?” she asked. “I don’t mean… That’s not a request—that’s a question. Do you think you could?”\n\u003e Halim stared into the fire. His face was drawn and un-handsome itself. “I… I don’t think so,” he said finally. “I want to say yes, for you. Because of what you said. But I’ve killed a few men, and it’s bad. And they have to be coming at me with swords, and it’s not like not like that, exactly. It’s like we’re all screaming and hammering on each other and you just want everyone else to stop screaming and you hope you stop them before they stop you. It’s just noise and mud and not thinking. But it’s still bad. Afterward, you remember too much of it. And that’s men trying to kill me. I don’t think I can kill a little girl who’s asleep.”\n\n\u003e “You think you had to pay for *two hundred years* for a momentary slip of the tongue?”\n\n\u003e The magic sulked. It had been still and quiet for so long. It wanted to rage like a torrent, pour over things, sweep obstacles away. But it was her friend, and so it turned in its course and settled back in its bed, sullen and quiet once more.\n\n\u003e Fayette lay on the bed, bright as mushrooms in the dark.\n\n\u003e He snorted. After a moment, he leaned slightly toward her, so that their shoulders touched, and Toadling leaned back, and they sat together on the steps for a little time, with the magic washing over them like the sea.\n\n\u003e “All right,” said Halim, and turned away. “I do believe you.”\n\u003e Toadling waited for the but.\n\u003e It didn’t come.\n\n\u003e His eyes were grave. “Some things can’t be fixed.”\n\u003e “We couldn’t change her,” said Toadling, feeling as if the words were broken glass in her ruined throat. “The queen loved her and the nurse and I tried for years and love wasn’t enough and trying wasn’t enough and nothing we did changed *anything*!” She let out a croaking sob. Halim gathered her up awkwardly in his arms and she gripped the edges of his surcoat and cried black ink tears onto his shoulder. “It should have mattered. All that love and all that trying should have changed… *something*…”\n\u003e “I know,” he said. “I know.”\n\u003e Toadling shuddered and shivered against him. She wanted to turn into her quietest, coldest toad shape and sink into the mud and not think for a long time. But she stayed human instead, and Halim held her the way that no one had held her since she had left the greenteeth behind. \n\n\u003e Eventually she ran out of tears. There were centuries worth still locked up inside her, but her body could only shed so many at a time. She was aware that her eyes were ringed with black and looked as if she had been beaten, but there was nothing to be done about that.\n\n\u003e She had so many choices and she had never had choices, never been given a chance to choose anything more important than what fish to snatch or what herb to pick.\n\u003e It was paralyzing. *How does anyone manage?

One of the best books I’ve read about healing from abuse, dysfunction, and trauma. So much to relate to on every page (and not just because she had the same [Jimmy Eat World song ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-HPOHu8mY) as a lifeline in the early aughts).\n\nIt’s heartbreaking and eye-opening that her upbringing (Asian, middle-class, immigrant; raised in what she correctly calls the wreckage of America’s brutal proxy wars against communism) is almost a 1:1 overlap with what was going on behind the scenes for almost everyone I knew growing up (white, middle-class, evangelical; basically the inheritors of the “American dream”). \n\nThe punishment, dysfunction, shame, rejection, generational trauma, and often the outright abuse (sexual, physical, mental) that just got silenced and covered up. When kids need literally the exact opposite to survive: love, acceptance, safety, trust, respect. A voice. \n\n\u003e I am a product of a place. I am one of many. All of us are victims of a dysfunctional community that was very good at throttling itself while murmuring, “Smile through your tears. Swallow your pain.”\n\u003e \n\u003e It is within this normalcy, this transformation of a unique misery into the utterly banal, that I finally feel empowered. Maybe I can change my programming after all. Because the more common the disease, the more survivors there must be. A whole damn neighborhood can’t go down together in its entirety, can it? There have to be people who escape the stranglehold.\n\nIt’s so validating when the key things that help her heal are the same things I’ve discovered. Note: she does *not* break it down into 1-2-3 steps for healing; these are my own notes, a list I made when what worked for her has worked for me as well: \n\n- Self-regulation (calming your nervous system, creating an internal sense of safety)\n- Curiosity (instead of judging or shutting down emotions, befriend them and listen to them; learn who you are when no one else is around)\n- Compassion (every trigger has a purpose; learn to ask “what is this? What is this thing in my body right now? What are you trying to teach me?”)\n- Communication (complex trauma is fundamentally relational trauma—people who were supposed to be caring and trustworthy and safe were hurtful instead; practice healthy relationships)\n- Agency (you have power, you have choice, you have a voice)\n- Love (love, love, love, in abundance, for others, for yourself; the opposite of shame, blame, and fear is love)\n\nThere’s no single magic fix; there’s a mix of what works for each person at various points in their lives. But there is healing, and hope, and I love her definition of both:\n\n\u003e So this is healing, then, the opposite of the ambiguous dread: *fullness*. I am full of anger, pain, peace, love, of horrible shards and exquisite beauty, and the lifelong challenge will be to balance all of those things, while keeping them in the circle. Healing is never final. It is never perfection. But along with the losses are the triumphs.\n\n---\n\n### Pull quotes: \n\n\u003e *It’s okay to have some things you never get over.* In the span of half an hour, this man whom I had known for less than a season did what nobody in my life ever had: He took all of my sins and simply forgave them. He didn’t demand relentless improvement. There were no ultimatums. He asserted that I was enough, as is. The gravity of it stunned me into silence. Joey was the opposite of the dread.\n\n\u003e My family tried to erase this history. But my body remembers. My work ethic. My fear of cockroaches. My hatred for the taste of dirt. These are not random attributes, a spin of the wheel. They were gifted to me with purpose, with necessity.\n\u003e \n\u003e I want to have words for what my bones know. I want to use those gifts when they serve me and understand and forgive them when they do not.\n\n\u003e The brain’s fear reflex is very real. But it has an opposite force, too, as ancient and as powerful. Our bodies and brains melt into kindness in the presence of one key ingredient. “This school made me feel like I was somewhere where people actually loved me.”\n\n\u003e But more and more, I am curious enough to ask the magic question: “What do you need?” These four words open doors and break down walls. With the benefit of understanding, we are no longer two separate beings floating through these threads alone. We are giving and receiving. Two reciprocal atoms hugging each other through the turmoil around us. *I hurt you. You hurt me. You’re mine.*\n\n\u003e PTSD is only a mental illness in times of peace.

I saw someone call him the original troll—that too, the radical printmaker in the time when printmaking was a real threat to the established order. Blake harnessed its power, provoking the church and state with his unorthodox satire.  \n  \nMy favorite work of his is probably easy to guess: A Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  \n  \nAt the chaotic end of the 18th century, William Blake, radical, takes aim at Swedenborg, theologian, for his treatise on the afterlife. He scorns Swedenborg’s theology, claiming it full of “all the old falsehoods.” In fact, Blake takes offense at his lack of creativity as much as his stolid ideas: dividing heaven from hell, soul from body, angels from devils, sinners from saints.  \n  \nIn Blake’s cosmology, there’s no division, just one whole. He flips the script, giving “the Devil” a voice that sounds awfully sensible. ‘Heaven’ is the staid authority, certainty, order; ‘Hell,’ therefore, according to Blake, is the necessary energy of humanity. Passion, chaos, creativity, emotion, desire. You can’t call one good and one evil, he contends, without an irrevocable loss. “Without contraries there is no progression.” In his fervent vision, we ARE the divine, soul and body together, good and evil together, culminating in his epiphany: “for every thing that lives is Holy.”  \n  \nAt around 15 pages, this work somehow feels like a magnum opus. What Blake calls his “Proverbs of Hell” are frank and energetic: “The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.” “What is now proved was once only imagin’d.” His art fills the page, clotting the margins with childlike intensity. It’s provocative and irreverent, disconcerting and droll, ingenious and moving.\n  \nTo be fair, C.S. Lewis comes for Blake in turn, undoing his great marriage in *The Great Divorce*. But arguably, Blake has outlasted Swedenborg. Arguably, he’ll outlast Lewis too. Life has a way of overturning the certainties. And thus Blake resonates, at least with me, in a way his rivals don’t. The contradictions are necessary. We could do worse than to listen, embrace the energy and the passion, the chaos and the doubt.","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.634908001Z","tags":[]},"/books/wintering":{"title":"Wintering","content":"DNF due to the health scare(s) both May and her husband experience at the beginning of the book.

I will never read a dictionary the same way again. This was even more interesting than I hoped it would be.\n\n\u003e I call it “craft” and not “art” for connotative reasons. “Art” conjures an image of the lexicographer as medium or conduit— a live wire that merely transmits something unkenned, alien. But “craft” implies care, repetitive work, apprenticeship, and practice. It is something within most people’s reach, but few people devote themselves to it long enough and with enough intensity to do it well. That sort of dedication to words comes across as batty, so we speak in metaphor. Defining is the mental equivalent of free throws in basketball: anyone can stand at the free-throw line and sink one occasionally; everyone gets lucky. But the pro is the person who stands at the free-throw line for hours, months, years, perfecting that one motion until it is as fail-safe as humanly possible, until it looks so much like second nature that an uncoordinated clod like me can watch them lob a rare miss at the net during a game and say, “Are you *kidding?* How easy is it to shoot a free throw?”\n\n## Stray notes\n\n* The wonky rules of English! (use the open compound “back seat” in the phrase “take a back seat” but the closed “backseat” when referring to the seats behind the driver, etc etc)\n* Asimov: “My opinions are strong, but not necessarily authoritative. Please realize that.” \n* “Pumpernickel,” traced back to its Germanic origins, means “fart goblin” \n* Worcester’s publishers steadfastly refused to bow to the vulgarity of cheap advertising, while the Merriam brothers went bonkers for it. “Get the best!” ads in 1849 proclaimed and never really stopped. \n* “She looked world-weary, like a circus clown two shows away from retirement, dolefully waiting for the inevitable pie right in the smacker.”\n* They’ll notice errors, but you can’t notice excellence in a dictionary because it consists of a lack of errors.\n\n---\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e “The fact is that many of the things that are presented to us as rules are really just the of-the-moment preferences of people who have had the opportunity to get their opinions published and whose opinions end up being reinforced and repeated down the ages as Truth.” p. 48\n\n\u003e The history of English is full of messiness and illogic because the English language is a true democracy, built entirely by the people who use and have used it, and people, generally speaking, are messy and illogical. p. 182\n\n\u003e Etymological fallacy is the worst sort of pedantry: a meaningless personal opinion trying to dress itself up as concern for preserving historical principles. It misses that language changes itself is a historical principle: a language that doesn’t change is a dead language, and as much as etymological fallacists seem to love the purity of Latin, you’ll notice that none of them have abandoned that whore English for it. p. 184\n\n\u003e Like everyone else, lexicographers need to move faster. This is, to be frank, nothing new: we have always felt the heavy thumb of business concerns whenever we define. And while defining gets easier with experience, and the easier it is to do something, the faster you can do it, there is a terminal velocity in lexicography. After a certain point, you simply can’t go any faster; to do so compromises the quality of what you’re doing. p. 259\n","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.634908001Z","tags":[]},"/books/zealot":{"title":"Zealot","content":"Great at painting a picture of 1st century Palestine.

Rufi Thorpe swooped in hot with one of my favorite books for the month (and year), but she was far from the only highlight. Let’s give this digest idea a whirl!\n\n---\n\n#### *[[books/mammoths at the gates|Mammoths at the Gates]]* — Nghi Vo (2023)\nOur beloved cleric Chih returns home to the Singing Hills Abbey, only to find (spoiler alert) mammoths at the gates, an imperial delegation come to collect one of their own. A lovely mediation on grief, change, and love, through a plot revealed as always in the layers and sediment of myth. Almost Brilliant gets a daughter, and an uncle, and a vast network of kin, and at long last we see more of the inner workings of the neixin (talking [hoopoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_hoopoe) who serve as the generational memory of the monastery). Nghi Vo continues to crush every single novella in this series, creating an ongoing rich tapestry. I’m so glad there’s going to be at least eight in total. (I’d try to bargain for twenty.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/home remedies|Home Remedies]]* — Xuan Juliana Wang (2019)\nA collection of short stories, of which my favorite is the pair of Olympic-level divers, trained to be each other’s shadow, one in unrequited love with the other. Sharp writing, skillful stories of China and its diaspora. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a green equinox|A Green Equinox]]* — Elizabeth Mavor (1973)\nSometimes you’re just in the mood for moody, queer af British novels with all the fraught gender politics and literary melodrama of the 1970’s. What can I say! So odd and compelling, like a fever dream. (Often literally, as there is an outbreak of typhoid that infects the course of the story.) No regrets for picking up this pretty little McNally Edition either, which, apart from the banging cover, is a tactile pleasure to hold.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/conversion|Conversion]]* — Otava Heikkilä (2020)\nA 12th century missionary finds shelter in a blizzard with a gruff, kindhearted hermit. The conversion is his own, shedding the self-loathing shame for genuine tender romantic connection. Like with *[[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]]*, Heikkilä does so much with so little, spare art and spare dialogue packing a punch of emotions. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/freak pleasures|Freak Pleasures: A BDSM Zine]]* — Otava Heikkilä (2022)\nNow this is protest art. Specifically, the protest of [SESTA/FOSTA](https://decriminalizesex.work/advocacy/sesta-fosta/what-is-sesta-fosta/) and the censorship it entails, not to mention the way it endangers those it purports to protect. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/experienced|Experienced]]* — Kate Young (2024)\nBette gets dumped-but-not-dumped in truly shitty fashion by her girlfriend, who suggests she just needs more experience since she’s newly out as a lesbian. Commence a sex odyssey through the wilds of Bristol, aided by her first failed date of the odyssey, the kind and thoughtful Ruth. Rarely does a romcom navigate the joys and pitfalls of queer relationships–and just relationships in general–with such aplomb. Every character feels fully realized and faceted. Friendships are central to the story, just the way I like it—especially Bette and Ash, but also the larger friend group, and the burgeoning friendship with Ruth that matters more than the crush for 80% of the book. There are tropes galore, all of them navigated skillfully, many of them skillfully subverted, without seeming twee, tiresome, or implausible.\n\nVery tender, very steamy, very messy, very British, very queer, very thoughtful. I enjoyed myself immensely.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/ninetails|Ninetails: Nine Tales]]* — Sally Wen Mao (2024)\nI love mythology turned feminist, but something about this was so on the nose that it didn’t quite pull me in. I may revisit in a different mood to see if I feel differently, or whether I’m comparing it unfairly to *[[books/home remedies|Home Remedies]]*, which was a better match to my taste in short stories.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/is this autism|Is This Autism?]]* — Donna Henderson, Sarah Wayland, and Jamell White (2023)\nOnce again I have read my way up from beginner to clinical level on a subject in the space of a year. I’m going to make a declarative statement that this is currently the best resource out there, full stop, on ASD and the myriad of ways it presents. The research is still in its infancy, but we’re starting to make strides in understanding it, especially how differently it can present in the non-male, non-white population. Therapists, psychiatrists, and clinicians, take note. (Pairs well with [[books/the autistic survival guide to therapy|Steph Jones]], which illustrates why this knowledge is desperately needed.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/earthlings|Earthlings]]* — Sayaka Murata (2018)\nYou could put trigger warnings on this for child abuse, incest, and cannibalism(!), and still the anguish of being forced to conform to society—”The Factory”—at the expense of all well-being forms the core of the horror. Particularly how women are reduced to wombs like factory components. Speculative fiction? Magical realism? Straight-up psychological horror? Yes. It’s harrowing and weird as fuck, and I liked it immensely, but maybe I’m Not Like Other Girls too.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/blackouts|Blackouts]]* — Justin Torres (2024)\nAll the different layers of meaning to the title—the blackouts our narrator experiences due to PTSD, the blackouts of Juan and his fading memory, the failure of institutional memory, the queer erasure from history, the literal blackouts of the pages of the book. It feels like a work of art, not just a novel. Indeed, if you’re looking for linear storytelling, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Lives up to the hype. Could not put it down. Experience the book in print form if at possible—the art is so integral to the story that it *is* the story. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/margo's got money troubles|Margo’s Got Money Troubles]]* — Rufi Thorpe (2024)\n20-year-old Margo sleeps with her professor, gets pregnant, keeps the baby, and discovers what a capitalist hellscape the U.S. is for mothers of all stripes, but particularly the unwed. Creating porn online becomes the only ethical way to survive, and this searing social commentary is wrapped up with so much humor and heart the book practically explodes with it. Her father Jinx (ex-pro wrestler, addict), her roommate Suzie (cosplayer extraordinaire), her lawyer Ward (low key one of the best characters in the book), and a host of fellow sex workers team up to become her ad-hoc support system, creating a found family in a way that rarely exists outside of LGBTQ books. (It need to be more common! In all kinds of books! Found family for everyone!)\n\nWhat I love most is that not a single character can be reduced to their 1–2 word descriptor. Everyone is a meat suit of startling complexity (except maybe the uber-religious stepfather, who fulfills his role to perfection). Thorpe also does some highly clever metatextual breaking of the fourth wall, switching between first and third POV to make various points about performance and fiction and the roles we play for an audience. This kind of experiment in less capable hands would be a disaster. Here, it’s brilliant. This will be on my year-end list of best books, for sure. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/camp damascus|Camp Damascus]]* — Chuck Tingle (2023)\nI had to wait until I was in a good headspace to handle this. Ruth, an autistic devout Christian on the cusp of adulthood, begins to realize everything in her life is not as it seems, not even herself. Cue the horror of religious trauma and conversion therapy camps, right at home with the traditional trappings of the horror genre. It gets genuinely creepy as hell as all hell is unleashed, quite literally in the case of demons run amok. (I could see where some readers would take issue that Chuck chose to make the demons real, and hell real, but that worked for me in the context of this book. Especially with the revelation of who the real monsters are, and that the demons are unwilling accomplices, ready to turn on their masters for what they’ve been forced to do.)\n\nI wish I didn’t have such a long list of conversion therapy survival books, but this is a worthy addition—maybe even the pinnacle. It’s the flavor of evangelicalism that I grew up in, with all the trauma that accompanies it. And of course it’s Chuck Tingle, so we get the happy ending. LOVE IS REAL. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/wintering|Wintering: The Power of Rest and Retreat in Difficult Times]]* — Katherine May (2020)\nDNF due to the health scare(s) both she and her husband experience at the beginning of the book. Even though I knew they were okay, it was too much to relive in the moment, my own recent family health scares too fresh. I skimmed ahead to see if I could just skip that part, but multiple other chapters failed to grab me. Love the concept; the execution feels NPR-ish and banal.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/kushiel's dart|Kushiel’s Dart]]* — Jacqueline Carey (2001)\nMy semi-decennial attempt to finish this book. I made it farther this time, with determination, but despite an attempt every three to five years, I still bounce off it like a rubber ball. Taboo, kink, AND court intrigue in the same book?! This should be exactly my thing! It’s overwrought in a way that makes me weary, though. And I wish the BDSM aspect was… *more*. More creative. More subversive. More than the pseudo-medieval French fanfic with a dash of mystical Jesus-y stuff and some weird moral judgments regarding kink. (All of Phèdre’s clients are bad people; anyone who’s good doesn’t desire the least bit of play in the bedroom. Say what now?) And! Another thing, if courtesans are revered on the level of divinity and a central part of the culture, then why is the language around it still demeaning? It’s hard to turn my brain off and other bits on, is what I’m saying. I think. \n\n(Either that, or I read Tiffany Reisz’s *Original Sinners* at too impressionable an age. Her take on “kink, but make it sacred”—and specifically “pain, but make it sacred”—coupled with irreverent humor and a thorough theology imprinted on me in a way that can’t be undone.)","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.634908001Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/info":{"title":"About me","content":"Hi!

B. Tylor.)\n\nFor self-identified animists, Graham Harvey explains, “the world and its various powers are neither good nor bad… but open, efficacious, and above all, relational.”\n\nTim Ingold: “We are dealing here not with a way of believing about the world, but with a condition of living in it.”\n\nFar from abolishing or preventing distinctions, then, this sort of animacy produces differences locally and interactively. Beings become the kind of beings they are in relation to the other beings who interact with them in a particular time and place.\n\nThe result of this dynamic, relational structure is not uniformity, all-is-oneness, or a “pudding of one identity,” but “a web of interdependencies.” (cf. [[private/holobionts]])\n\n---\n## The indigenous attribution of agency\n\nPer Mary-Jane Rubenstein in *[[books/pantheologies|Pantheologies]]*:\n\nEach creature is directly responsible for the well-being of many beings at many times, but not for all beings at all times, and these “overlap[ping] connections” sustain a community united not by its identity to itself, but by its complex, mobile, and interrelated differentiations.\n\nAs one might note, however, these distinctions (between the physical and the metaphysical, the this-worldly and the otherworldly, or the religious and the ethical) are rooted in the oppositions between spirit and matter, creator and created, that “animism” purportedly rejects.\n\nThe implication is that the indigenous attribution of agency and even personhood to vegetal life is not irrational, infantile, narcissistic, or delusional (which is to say, religious); to the contrary, these insights are so sophisticated that “plant science” has confirmed them.\n\nAnd it is precisely at this point that indigenous philosophies might congratulate earth-systems science for having finally caught up to what it has known all along; as Vine Deloria attests, “traditional Indians,” who have always asserted the animacy of the universe, “are quite amused to see this revival of the debate over whether the planet is alive.”","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.746908411Z","tags":["nature"]},"/notes/apophatic-naming":{"title":"Apophatic naming","content":"Apophatic naming, or negative naming, is the attempt to call a thing by so many names that its essential nature transcends all of them.

Far enemies are the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. For example, a near enemy of loving-kindness is sentimentality—similar but different. A far enemy of loving-kindness is ill will—the opposite of loving-kindness. Similarly, a near enemy of compassion is pity and a far enemy is cruelty.”\n\n\u003e The near enemies depict how spirituality can be misunderstood or misused to separate us from life. (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e I define spirituality as the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to each other by something greater than ourselves. I have friends who are atheists who every day practice inextricable connection—they hurt when others hurt and they know that none of us are free until all of us are free. I have friends who talk endlessly about their religion and wear scripture on their T-shirts, yet demonstrate no connection to anyone’s suffering but their own and maybe that of the people in their immediate circle. I make this point because we’re not talking about religion here. We’re talking about the irrepressible human spirit.\n\n\u003e On the surface, the near enemies of emotions or experiences might look and even feel like connection, but ultimately they drive us to be disconnected from ourselves and from each other. Without awareness, near enemies become the practices that fuel separation, rather than practices that reinforce the inextricable connection of all people.\n\n\u003e “The near enemy of love is attachment. Attachment masquerades as love. It says, “I will love this person (because I need something from them).” Or, “I’ll love you if you’ll love me back. I’ll love you, but only if you will be the way I want.” This isn’t the fullness of love. Instead there is attachment—there is clinging and fear. True love allows, honors, and appreciates; attachment grasps, demands, needs, and aims to possess.” (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e Near enemies can feel like manipulation and even gaslighting. Of course the far enemies destroy connection too—but you see them coming.

She explains that debility can’t be understood as an identity like disability, which is usually thought of as an event that happens to an individual, after which they just need accommodations, access, and personal empowerment to be included in society. Rather, debility is what happens when a state makes an entire population available for mass injury — a denial of disability rights altogether.[^1]\n\nThis leads to cognitive dissonance and egregious hypocrisy, where a state perpetuating *genocide* can nonetheless claim themselves a champion of disability justice within that framework of disability rights:\n\n\u003e Israel is, in fact, a signatory on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The IDF proudly claims to be the world’s largest employer of [[notes/autism|autistic people]], and in August, an ambassador told the UN that Israel is committed to eliminating ableism. But this disability rights frame, which for a long time, has been led and theorized by white disabled people who live in the US and Europe, doesn’t map onto the experiences of racialized groups who are targeted en masse by the state.[^2]\n\nIt’s back to that same concept of [[notes/worthy victims|worthy victims]] and [[notes/who is more deserving|who is deserving]]. The [entire essay from Jesse Meadows](https://sluggish.substack.com/p/what-does-disability-justice-mean) is worth a read. \n\n\u003e When repression is globalized, our solidarity must be, too.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, we’re seeing the same thing happen in the US with COVID and the subsequent debilitating experience of Long COVID. In response to NPR platforming a woman who sees her disabled husband’s new social limitations as an irritation he is personally inflicting on her, rather than an institutional problem being inflicted on all of us, Julia Doubleday calls out the injustice for what it is. [She writes](https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/disabled-peoples-exclusion-from-indoor):\n\n\u003e This article is not merely an upsetting look at an individual’s victim-blaming mindset about her husband’s indefinite exclusion from public spaces. It is a piece of propaganda intended to further the perception that demands for COVID mitigation are unreasonable complaints, rather than critical activism for basic public health infrastructure.\n\nIt’s the same denial of civil rights, blaming the victim instead of urging awareness and action.\n\n\u003e It is a classically neoliberal world view, one that places the onus of the difficult situation on the *individual* over the collective, that blames the sufferer rather than investigating the underlying root causes of the suffering. “My husband can’t dine indoors because every restaurant is currently violating the ADA” is not a piece NPR will ever publish; it is, however, both a more accurate summation of the problem, as well as one that invites action rather than acceptance.[^3]\n\n[^1]: https://sluggish.substack.com/p/what-does-disability-justice-mean\n[^2]: ibid\n[^3]: https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/disabled-peoples-exclusion-from-indoor\n","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.750908427Z","tags":["activism","language"]},"/notes/deep-time":{"title":"Deep time","content":"Deep time, coined by [[authors/john mcphee|John McPhee]] in *[[books/annals of the former world|Basin and Range]]*, is a concept of geological time so vast it completely annihilates the scale of human history.\n\n\u003e Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time.

(Whyte and Brown, lol.)\n\n((Note: maybe what I classify as despair would be more what Brown describes as anguish??))\n\nPer Whyte, in *[[books/consolations|Consolations]]*, despair is a necessary and [[seasonal time|seasonal state]] of repair, a temporary healing absence, an internal physiological and psychological winter when our previous forms of participation in the world take a rest; it is a loss of horizon, it is the place we go when we do not want to be found in the same way anymore.\n\n\u003e Despair takes us in when we have no place else to go. It is a haven of self-compassion, an invitation, a last protection.\n\nBrown classifies despair as the permanent state of hopelessness, whereas Whyte calls it, “strangely, the last bastion of hope,” which turns to depression and abstraction when we try to make it stay beyond its appointed season. (So still the emphasis on the necessary and *seasonal* state of *repair*.)\n\n\u003e Despair is kept alive by freezing our sense of time and the rhythms of [[notes/concepts of time|time]]; when we no longer feel imprisoned by time, and when the season is allowed to turn, despair cannot survive.\n\nThis feels like it can encompass more of what I classify as despair, which is usually part anguish, part grief, part shutdown, overwhelmed by something I no longer want to be a part of. (The ongoing US-backed genocide in Palestine; the climate crisis; every war across the globe.) \n\nIn *Atlas*, it’s more personal, and doesn’t really include that *necessary* need for hibernation and repair. What Whyte calls a difficult, beautiful necessity, as human beings caught in a fierce and difficult world where half of our experience is mediated by loss.\n\nAnd how to emerge, when nothing is in one’s control to fix? By giving the despair a profound and courageous attention. \n\n\u003e To see and experience despair fully in our body is to begin to see it as a necessary, seasonal visitation, and the first step in letting it have its own life, neither holding it nor moving it on before its time.\n\nBasically, you could say it is a waveform, not a prison: \n\n\u003e We take the first steps out of despair by taking on its full weight and coming fully to ground in our wish not to be here. We let our bodies and we let our world breathe again. In that place, strangely, despair cannot do anything but change into something else, into some other season, as it was meant to do, from the beginning.\n\nThat makes me think of [[ecclesiastes|Ecclesiastes]], *to everything a season*.

In this way, the laws of chemistry can be said to be emergent from physics: the laws of chemistry presuppose the laws of physics, but can’t simply be reduced to them. In the same way, the laws of biology emerge from chemistry: one obviously needs to understand the chemical components of a fish to understand how it swims, but chemical components will never provide a full explanation.

They energize us for fight-and-flight and live in our limbic system. \n\n**Routine emotions** such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and anger nourish our lives, lasting for a while then fading. Humans, on average 30 or more different emotional states every day. These emotions don’t require thought—they occur as a matter of course, and originate in the sensory part of the brain. (Note: it is likely the routine emotions that are hardest for people with alexithymia to access.)\n\n**Reflective emotions** such as anger, grief, and jealousy occur primarily in our prefrontal cortex and require conscious thought. \n\nReactive emotions are some of the hardest ones to cool off. These are happening in the limbic and survival portions of the brain, and our prefrontal cortex is what houses our executive functioning and observing self. When this part of our brain is online, we’re more easily able to calm ourselves down. But that is the precise part of the brain that tends to go offline during emotionally intense moments. Some studies have shown that ADHDers and Autistic people have reduced connectivity between the more emotional centers of our brains and our prefrontal cortex, and must work harder to bring the prefrontal cortex back online during emotionally hot moments.\n\nWhen we can take two seconds to pause and identify the emotion, we are bringing observing and reflective self to the forefront, which helps to bring our prefrontal cortex back online. This helps calm the whole system down.  When we label our emotions, we recruit our prefrontal cortex to come help down-regulate the limbic system and so-called “reptilian brain.” \n\nThis is likely one reason we see increased rates of anxiety among people with alexithymia. Because they cannot label their emotions, they aren’t as easily able to recruit their prefrontal cortex to help out and self-soothe when their fear system gets activated.

Queen Elizabeth proclaimed a set of laws designed to maintain order and contribute to the general good of the kingdom: **the English Poor Laws**.  These laws remained in force for more than 250 years with only minor changes. Essentially, the laws distinguished ==three major categories of dependents: the vagrant, the involuntary unemployed, and the helpless==. The laws also set forth ways and means for dealing with each category of dependents. Most important, the laws established the parish (i.e.,local government), acting through an overseer of the poor appointed by local officials, as the administrative unit for executing the law.\n\u003e\n\u003e The poor laws gave the local government the power to raise taxes as needed and use the funds to build and maintain almshouses; to provide indoor relief (i.e., cash or sustenance) for the aged, handicapped and other ==worthy poor==; and the tools and materials required to put the unemployed to work. Parents were required to support their children and grandchildren. ==Likewise, children were responsible for the care of their unemployable parents and grandparents.== Children whose parents could not support them were forced into mandatory apprenticeships. ==They had no right to object== to the compensation or the interference with their own child-rearing activities. Vagrants and ==any able bodied persons who refused to work== could be committed to a house of correction or fined.\n\u003e\n\u003e In response to concerns that dependent persons would move to parishes where financial assistance was more generous, ==in 1662 a severe **Law of Settlement and Removal** was enacted in England==. The law made it possible for local authorities to force individuals and families to leave a town and return to their home parish if they became dependent. In effect, this law allowed a local government to restrict aid only to persons and families known to be “residents.”\n\u003e\n\u003e==The American colonies and state governments== modeled their public assistance for the poor on the **Elizabethan Poor Laws and the Law of Settlement and Removal**.\n\nNote the sorting into categories, the “worthy poor,” the children with no right to object, the laws of increasing severity in order to close the loopholes.

Then, they die.\n\u003e \n\u003e I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a “two sided market,” where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them.\n\nPart of that has to be about consuming vs. creating.

The platforms that have the most traction with young users today—YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch—function like broadcast stations, with one creator posting a video for her millions of followers; what the followers have to say to one another doesn’t matter the way it did on the old Facebook or Twitter. [[notes/social media is the third place|Social media “used to be more of a place for conversation and reciprocity,”]] Stern said.

The emphasis of lawmakers and policymakers shouldn’t be preserving the crepuscular senescence of dying platforms. Rather, our policy focus should be on minimizing the cost to users when these firms reach their expiry date: enshrining rights like end-to-end would mean that no matter how autocannibalistic a zombie platform became, willing speakers and willing listeners would still connect with each other.","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.750908427Z","tags":["working-theories"]},"/notes/everything-is-fiction":{"title":"Everything is fiction","content":"[Everything is Fiction](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/everything-is-fiction), Keith Ridgeway: \n\n\u003e And I mean that—everything is fiction.

Homer wrote historyfic and Virgil wrote Homerfic and Dante wrote Virgilfic (_where he makes himself a character and writes himself hanging out with Homer and Virgil_ and they’re like “_OMG Dante you’re so cool._” He was the original [Gary Stu](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mary_Sue)). Milton wrote Bible fanfic, and everyone and their mom spent the Middle Ages writing \u003ca href=\"/shelves/arthurian/\" class=\"internal-link\"\u003eKing Arthur fanfic\u003c/a\u003e. In the sixteenth century you and another dude could translate the same Petrarchan sonnet and somehow have it count as two separate poems, and no one gave a fuck. Shakespeare _doesn’t have a single original plot_—although much of it would be more rightly termed RPF—and then John Fletcher and Mary Cowden Clarke and Gloria Naylor and Jane Smiley and Stephen Sondheim wrote Shakespeare fanfic. Guys like Pope and Dryden took old narratives and rewrote them to make fun of people they didn’t like, because the eighteenth century was basically high school. And Spenser! Don’t even get me started on Spenser.\n\u003e \n\u003e Here’s what fanfic authors/fans need to remember when anyone gives them shit: _the idea that originality is somehow a good thing, an innately preferable thing, [[notes/the culturally bound notion of authorship|is a completely modern notion]]._ Until about three hundred years ago, a good writer, by and large, was someone who could take a tried-and-true story and make it even more awesome. (If you want to sound fancy, the technical term is _imitatio_.) People were like, _why would I wanna read something about some dude I’ve never heard of? There’s a new Sir Gawain story out, man!_ (As to when and how that changed, I tend to blame Daniel Defoe, or the Modernists, or reality television, depending on my mood.)\n\u003e \n\u003e I also find fanfic fascinating because it takes all the barriers that keep people from professional authorship—barriers that have weakened over the centuries but are nevertheless still very real—and blows right past them. Producing literature, much less circulating it, was something that was well nigh impossible for the vast majority of people for most of human history. First you had to live in a culture where people thought it was acceptable for you to even want to be literate in the first place. And then you had to find someone who could teach you how to read _and_ write (the two didn’t necessarily go together). And you needed sufficient leisure time to learn. And be able to afford books, or at least be friends with someone rich enough to own books who would lend them to you. Good writers are usually well-read and professional writing is a full-time job, so you needed a lot of books, and a lot of leisure time both for reading and writing. And then you had to be in a high enough social position that someone would take you seriously and want to read your work—to have access to circulation/publication in addition to education and leisure time. \n\u003e \n\u003e A very tiny percentage of the population fit those parameters (in England, which is the only place I can speak of with some authority, that meant from 500–1000 A.D.: monks; 1000–1500: aristocratic men and the very occasional aristocratic woman; 1500–1800: aristocratic men, some middle-class men, a few aristocratic women; 1800–on, some middle-class women as well). \n\u003e \n\u003e What’s amazing is how many people who didn’t fit those parameters kept writing in spite of the constant message they got from society that no one cared about what they had to say, writing letters and diaries and stories and poems that often weren’t discovered until hundreds of years later. Humans have an urge to express themselves, to tell stories, and fanfic lets them. If you’ve got access to a computer and an hour or two to while away of an evening, you can create something that people will see and respond to instantly, with a built-in community of people who care about what you have to say. \n\u003e \n\u003e I do write the occasional fic; I wish I had the time and mental energy to write more. I’ll admit I don’t read a lot of fic these days because most of it is not—and I _know_ how snobbish this sounds—particularly well-written. That doesn’t mean it’s “not good”—there are a lot of reasons people read fic and not all of them have to do with wanting to read finely crafted prose. That’s why fic is awesome—it creates a place for all kinds of storytelling. But for me personally, now that my job entails reading about 1500 pages of undergraduate writing per year, when I have time to read for enjoyment I want it to be by someone who really knows what they’re doing. There’s tons of high-quality fic, of course, but I no longer have the time and patience to go searching for it that I had ten years ago. But whether I’m reading it or not, I love that fanfiction exists. Because without people doing what fanfiction writers do, _literature_ wouldn’t exist. (And then I’d be out of a job and, frankly, I don’t know how to do anything else.)\n\nI sourced the post [here](https://allanamayer.tumblr.com/post/73223957387/i-think-fanfiction-is-literature-and-literature), as the original post, [“As a professor, may I ask you what you think about fanfiction?”](http://onlyalittlelion.tumblr.com/post/29097051054/tywinning-asked-you-2012-08-09-03-37-as-a) is already lost to the ether.

This rhetorical background served to explain the acquisition of territories or reasons to go to war, such as the war with Mexico in 1840s.\n\nOutside the United States, the effects of manifest destiny were seen in U.S. intervention in the Spanish-American war when Spain ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico and Guam to the U.S. This was an expansion of U.S. territory as colonies rather than states and was ==another demonstration of growing U.S. imperialism==.\n\nThe term of ‘Manifest Destiny’ first appeared in a newspaper article on the annexation of Texas in edition from July/August of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review in 1845.

It’s maddening, it’s challenging. It’s delightful. It’s a heady rush of satisfaction when the pieces start to click. It’s completely different from worldbuilding that stays dense, illogical, and nonsensical. A lazy author not even bothering to build a puzzle is detectable at first glance from the author you won’t be able to understand until the second read.\n\nIt takes trust. Trust from the author in the reader, and trust from the reader in the author. I won’t trust the author until I can tell they’ve put their trust in me.\n\n[[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]], puzzle-book writer extraordinaire, talks about this in her introduction to *[[books/shadow \u0026 claw|Shadow \u0026 Claw]]*:\n\n\u003e Reading for world-building is a skill. I have seen brilliant people, laureates, inventors, Ph.D.s, try to read fiction with deep world-building and fail completely, looping back, rereading, never following events, trapped in a sense of muddled wandering. Reading for world-building requires retaining information without context: a term, a place, a coin, a category comes up once and we know what that is—a puzzle piece—that our task is to gather up these pieces as the author drops them, and to slowly assemble the whole. This is not easy. Human memory needs hooks for facts: a mnemonic, a story, context, something; grueling textbook rote-learning fades quickly, but a story of the statesman or the king, that’s what makes knowledge stay.\n\nInterestingly, she notes this is a skill kids seem to have naturally: \n\n\u003e To retain puzzle pieces that don’t connect, dropped without context, is a skill that not all have. All had it once: it is how children read, every book, poster, and headline a stream of unknown terms, far too many to ask about them all, but the child retains them, trusting that they will connect to something someday. Kids [[notes/rhizomatic thinking|collect Earth’s puzzle pieces]] every time they read, but as we move to grown-up books they all use the same picture, and define immediately those terms they fear a reader may not know. Thus the skill of keeping puzzle pieces fades, unless we read books set in other worlds, new puzzle pictures which make us retain the skill, as frogs sometimes retain their tadpole tails into adulthood. This—many have observed—is why most F\u0026SF readers come to the genre young, it’s hard to start in adulthood when one’s puzzle-memory skill has sat atrophied.\n\nShe goes on to say that [[authors/gene wolfe|Gene Wolfe]] asks even more, and that like learning to swim before one swims for fun, in many ways one reads the [[series/the book of the new sun|Book of the New Sun]] only on the second pass.\n\nNo wonder my childlike puzzle-loving brain loves this kind of deep worldbuilding.

Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein. And we didn’t even work hard at it — much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else’s field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\u003e\n\u003eFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn’t have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. ==It wasn’t the meat that made the difference. It was the story.==\n\u003e \n\u003e It is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\u003e \n\u003eThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn’t their story. It’s his.\n\u003e \n\u003e When she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, Virginia Woolf wrote a heading in her notebook, “Glossary”; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. ==One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as “botulism.” And _hero_, in Woolf’s dictionary, is “bottle.” The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.==\n\u003e \n\u003e Not just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you haven’t got something to put it in, food will escape you — even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it’s cold and raining and wouldn’t it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn’t it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e *The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.*\n\u003e \n\u003e So says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women’s Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don’t know. I don’t even care. I’m not telling that story. ==We’ve heard it, we’ve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.==\n\u003e \n\u003e And yet old. Before — once you think about it, surely long before — the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger — for what’s the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can’t eat home in — with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\u003e \n\u003e This theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. ==(“What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman’s lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,” Lillian Smith observed.)== The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that’s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\u003e \n\u003e That’s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\u003e \n\u003e Go on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\u003e\n\u003e If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it’s useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again — if to do that is human, if that’s what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.\n\u003e \n\u003e Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don’t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It’s just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.\n\u003e\n\u003e It sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we’d better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one’s finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\u003e \n\u003e It’s unfamiliar, it doesn’t come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, “untold” was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\u003e \n\u003e ==The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story.== Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it.[^1] So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn’t any good if he isn’t in it.\n\u003e\n\u003e I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. ==A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.==\n\u003e \n\u003e One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but ==the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd.== (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, “A story should be seen as a battle,” and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\u003e\n\u003e Finally, it’s clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. ==You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.==\n\u003e\n\u003e That is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\u003e\n\u003e So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse’s skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don’t understand. ==I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn’t say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?==\n\u003e \n\u003e If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. “Technology,” or “modern science” (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the “hard” sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\u003e \n\u003e If, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time’s-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\u003e \n\u003e Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else ==in this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story.== In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool’s joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn’t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\nSource: https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf\n\n[^1]: This makes me think of that bluntly brilliant line in *[[books/always coming home|Always Coming Home]]*: “He thought his hero-soul was in his balls.”","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.754908441Z","tags":["storytelling","creative-practice"]},"/notes/the-culturally-bound-notion-of-authorship":{"title":"The culturally bound notion of authorship","content":"[[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*: \n\n\u003e Our modern, Western notion that authorship should be solo and original is comparatively young and culturally bound, dating back only to after we had the ability to make faithful and exact copies at a mass scale.

The Carolingians constructed a Christian piety that used violence to convert pagans and then taught its victims to regard their violation as justified and sanctified.[^1]\n\nThis is the very same concept was perpetuated via [[notes/manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]. Once the colonies were settled, it became America’s founding myth. They had already inherited this legacy of violence, us vs. them, and either had to renounce their beliefs (so difficult!) or see themselves as superior and entitled to conquer this land. \n\n\u003e Puritan religious piety could not teach the equilibrium and equanimity needed to heal from horror, to relinquish fear, to forgive their enemies or themselves, and to repair harm. They lacked the spiritual disciplines that taught them to observe the world carefully, to trust the senses, and to wonder at the beauty of the land.[^2]\n\nThus the groundwork was laid, and all around us we see a blind, unquestioned belief in those principles. “Just because a myth is old doesn’t mean it’s healthy.”[^3] [[notes/healthy stories are fluid not fixed|What can our new myths be?]]\n\n[^1]: Rebecca Ann Parker and Rita Nakashima Brock, *Saving Paradise*\n[^2]: *ibid*\n[^3]: Sophie Strand, *The Flowering Wand*","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.754908441Z","tags":["belief-systems"]},"/notes/untamed-episode-notes":{"title":"The Untamed episode notes 《陈情令》","content":"\nMy raw notes for *The Untamed*, started when I was trying to make sense of the plot but now an indispensable resource for fic.

Totally fits because as much as I love her as an author ([[Lent]]! [[books/among others|Among Others]]!), I always say Jo is my favorite reader. \n\nI was trying to find out if [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]] coined vocateur in the [[series/terra ignota|Terra Ignota]] series, and just a cursory google search all give her credit for the term. The only early citation I could find is [a JSTOR article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26281186) from 1983 which, from the preview, seems to be discussing Arno Schmidt’s *Leviathan*. So maybe an obscure term (possibly in translation?) that Ada popularized, at least? \n\nAnyway. Vocateur (“voker” for short) is basically someone intensely devoted to their chosen vocation. I like the connotation with [[amateur]] too, which in French, means “lover.” A “*lover of*,” instead of “*expert at*.” You could say a *vocateur* cultivates that *amateur* love into expertise.\n\nIn the post-scarcity world of Terra Ignota, careers are a thing of the past, no one needs to earn their basic necessities, and one is not permitted to work more than a certain number of hours per week (10 I think?). Vocateurs apply for the permission to work extended hours on their passions. \n\nFrom [an interview with Ada](https://mrissa.livejournal.com/966088.html?): \n\n\u003e I’ve been delighted to have a lot of readers respond enthusiastically to voker/vocateur, and I do think it’s something we see every day but don’t have a good name for, the difference between someone who works and then stops versus someone for whom work is an all-hours passion.  We have “day job” but that implies that it’s somehow not important, not the real you, whereas I have friends who love their jobs and are great at them but are still happy that the job ends when they clock out.  I like how voker/vocateur make clear that both kinds of relationship to one’s work are good and worthy of respect.\n\nAppealing to that passion/love/respect makes the word useful to discuss the opposite too:\n\n\u003e I think the word “vocateur” is an important one to have as a tool for discussing job exploitation, how so many jobs that people are willing to do for love become riddled with exploitative practices (teaching, research, writing, animation, social work...)[^1]\n\n[^1]: [Ada Palmer on Twitter, 12/25/19](https://twitter.com/Ada_Palmer/status/1209982918321414150)","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.754908441Z","tags":["lexicon"]},"/notes/vorfreude":{"title":"Vorfreude","content":"The German word vorfruede has no English equivalent.

Why does the existence of action carried out for the sheer pleasure of acting strike us as mysterious? What does it say about us that we  assume that it is?\n\nWe can’t reduce all living beings to rational, market actors. This tendency has been present since the 19th century beginnings of Darwinian science. Darwin, after all, borrowed the term “survival of the fittest” from the sociologist Herbert Spencer, that darling of robber barons–who was struck by how much the forces driving natural selection jibed with his own laissez-faire economic theories. \n\nCompetition over resources, rational calculation of advantage, and the gradual extinction of the weak were taken to be the prime directives of the universe. But why?\n\nAn alternative school of Darwinism emerged in Russia emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change. cf. [[books/mutual aid|Mutual Aid]] by Pyotr Kropotkin. It’s not just about cooperation as a means to an end though—Kropotkin posits that pleasure and play is an end in itself.\n\n## The origins of consciousness and free will \n\nFriedrich Schiller had already argued in 1795 that it was precisely in play that we find the origins of self-consciousness, and hence freedom, and hence morality.\n\nThis argument gets ignored, since cooperation for pleasure, as an end in itself, is difficult to recuperate for ideological purposes.\n\n## Is emergence enough?\n\n[[notes/emergence|Emergence]] is well and good, but is it enough to explain what’s going on? For example, if an electron is acting freely—if it, as Richard Feynman is supposed to have said, “does anything it likes”—it can only be acting freely as an end in itself. Which would mean that at the very foundations of physical reality, we encounter freedom for its own sake—which also means we encounter the most rudimentary form of play.\n\n## Play is not an anomaly\n\n\u003e What would happen if we proceeded from the reverse perspective and agreed to treat play not as some peculiar anomaly, but as our starting point, a principle already present not just in lobsters and indeed all living creatures, but also on every level where we find what physicists, chemists, and biologists refer to as “self-organizing systems”?\n\nThis gives us ground to unthink the world around us.\n\n## A famous Taoist story\n\nGraeber says when he taught at Yale, he would assign a reading of the following Taoist story, offering an automatic “A” to any student who could tell him why the last line made sense. (None ever succeeded.)\n\n\u003e Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on a bridge over the River Hao, when the former observed, “See how the minnows dart between the rocks! Such is the happiness of fishes.”\n\u003e “You not being a fish,” said Huizi, “how can you possibly know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “And you not being I,” said Zhuangzi, “how can you know that I don’t know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “If I, not being you, cannot know what you know,” replied Huizi, “does it not follow from that very fact that you, not being a fish, cannot know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “Let us go back,” said Zhuangzi, “to your original question. You asked me how I knew what makes fish happy. The very fact you asked shows that you knew I knew—as I did know, from my own feelings on this bridge.”\n\nThe anecdote is usually taken as a confrontation between two irreconcilable approaches to the world: the logician versus the mystic. But if that’s true, then why did Zhuangzi, who wrote it down, show himself to be defeated by his logician friend?\n\n\u003e After thinking about the story for years, it struck me that this was the entire point. By all accounts, Zhuangzi and Huizi were the best of friends. They liked to spend hours arguing like this. Surely, that was what Zhuangzi was really getting at. We can each understand what the other is feeling because, arguing about the fish, ==we are doing exactly what the fish are doing: having fun, doing something we do well for the sheer pleasure of doing it. Engaging in a form of play.== The very fact that you felt compelled to try to beat me in an argument, and were so happy to be able to do so, shows that the premise you were arguing must be false. Since if even philosophers are motivated primarily by such pleasures, by the exercise of their highest powers simply for the sake of doing so, then surely this is a principle that exists on every level of nature—which is why I could spontaneously identify it, too, in fish.\n\n## Stray notes\n\n- Debunks Richard Dawkins and The Selfish Gene, likewise Dennett\n- Jean-Paul Sartre at one point became erotically obsessed with lobsters after taking too much mescaline 🤣\n- Physicists are the poets of the scientific world (more playful and less hidebound creatures than, say, biologists— partly, no doubt, because they rarely have to contend with religious fundamentalists challenging the laws of physics)","lastmodified":"2024-07-30T20:54:24.754908441Z","tags":["pleasure-and-play","working-theories"]},"/notes/who-is-more-deserving":{"title":"Who is more deserving","content":"\n\u003e As if deserving meant anything.
