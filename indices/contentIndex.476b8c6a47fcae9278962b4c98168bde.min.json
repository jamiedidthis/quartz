In botany, it describes a plant system that extends roots and shoots from its nodes in every direction.\n\n[The rhizome was adopted as a philosophical concept](https://literariness.org/2017/04/26/the-philosophical-concept-of-rhizome/) to describe a process of existence and growth with no clear heirarchy or single central point of origin. It doesn‚Äôt start from anywhere or end anywhere; it grows from everywhere, can reproduce from any node, and has no center, which makes it difficult to uproot or destroy. The internet is a rhizome. [[Language is a network|Language is a rhizome]]. \n\nIn the modern western world, we have inherited an arborescent view of the world (tree-like, heirarchic).

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3.

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1.

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first.

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.

At least he is not alone with it this time. Lan Qiren is furious, unable to outfox the brash young cultivator standing in the middle of the class, who is giving eloquent, textbook answers to every question, answering so swiftly and humbly that it almost feels like a mockery, like he could yawn his way through it the way he has most of the morning, idly doodling and dozing, except for the fact that something interesting is finally happening and he‚Äôs going to enjoy the moment the way he would unwrap a sweet.\n\nLan Wangji is there for appearances. He is supposed to sit straight-backed and disciplined, the perfect model of a student, the shining pinnacle of everything the Lan have to offer. *He* is supposed to swiftly and humbly recite the correct answer when a student falters like an untutored novice. *He* is not supposed to feel his heart race, his fingers curling in his sleeves, outdone by a careless, lazy flirt who aims his smile at Lan Wangji as precisely as an arrow, treating scholarly, serious subjects like a practice game of swords. \n\n*Wei Wuxian.* The name is made for clenched teeth, for outbursts of frustration. He must have been old enough to be like‚Ä¶ *this,* already, when he was given the name. \n\nLan Wangji feels scant satisfaction when Lan Qiren does have to call on him. Scanter satisfaction still when the room erupts in shouts like someone kicked a hive of bees. Lan Qiren throws his scroll. Wei Wuxian expertly ducks. By then it‚Äôs all just one long buzz in Lan Wangji‚Äôs head, *improper cultivation, redirection not suppression,* Lan Wangji already bowing when Lan Qiren orders him to the library to administer Wei Wuxian‚Äôs punishment. \n\nIt‚Äôs what he had asked for the first night, hauling Wei Wuxian in and tossing him down on the carpet in front of the two elder Lan. Punishment, principles, they were all in place for a reason. They were not to be scoffed at, eyes going wide as the moon at the sheer number of them, brushed off like dust shaken off his long sleeves. \n\nThey will be written, at length, in detail, line by line, by the thousands, until Wei Wuxian‚Äôs hand is so crabbed he cannot ink a brush, willpower so broken that he will only ever speak politely when spoken to, the fire of his spirit so quenched that the grin falls off his face. It‚Äôs this image Lan Wangji cherishes, mentally painting it brushstroke by brushstroke, rendering it in loving detail as he hauls Wei Wuxian from a waterfall and plants him in the library. \n\nIt can take all summer, if it needs to. \n\nWei Wuxian will *learn.* \n\n---- \n\nWei Wuxian does not learn. \n\nLan Wangji, diligent in all of his duties, reports on his progress to Xichen, and occasionally to their uncle himself, at the end of each week. Five copies transcribed. A dozen. A hundred. ‚ÄúOne hundred and forty-three,‚Äù he says this evening. Strictly speaking, it is one hundred and forty-two and a half, because he crumpled up the final pages and told Wei Wuxian to do them over when he had inked most of the margins with stick figures kissing. But Lan Wangji is generous. He *will* make Wei Wuxian finish those pages; he will also finesse that number slightly to his brother for the sake of expedience.\n\n*Do not be needlessly pedantic,* principle one-eighty-five. \n\nIt is only his brother he reports to tonight, who looks over the pages Lan Wangji has brought him (sans stick figures kissing), and remarks, ‚ÄúHis calligraphy is not improving.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMn,‚Äù Lan Wangji says. \n\nXichen suppresses a small smile. ‚ÄúUnlike his behavior in class. He has not caused a disruption in over a week. We have you to thank, Wangji.‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji purses his lips. They do. They have him to thank, because *now,* Wei Wuxian vibrates through class with all of his pent-up questions, unleashing the torrent on Lan Wangji as soon as they escape to the library, like a river flooding its banks. *Now,* Wei Wuxian directs a significant portion of his energy to the study and torment of Lan Wangji, fixating upon him like a particularly interesting specimen that he will pick apart with his fingers and consume piece by piece.\n\n*Do not be ungracious,* principle sixty-six. \n\n‚Äú‚Äîknow it‚Äôs been a trial for you,‚Äù Xichen is saying. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done well, but I will have a word with Uncle. There is no reason one of the outer disciples cannot watch over him instead.‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji feels a pulse of alarm. An *outer disciple,* in Wei Wuxian‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says sharply.\n\n‚ÄúNo?‚Äù \n\nLan Wangji lowers his gaze in respect. It lands on the sheaf of pages Xichen holds, all the columns inked crookedly.[^1] ‚ÄúIt would not‚Ä¶‚Äù He falters.\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶be wise?‚Äù Xichen finishes. ‚ÄúAh. I suppose not. You are right. Still, you have better things to do with your time. You are gracious, Wangji.‚Äù \n\nNo. No, he is not. He is‚Ä¶ irresponsible, and incautious, and he doesn‚Äôt know why it feels like he told a lie when he did not. The vast pit of unease that sits in his stomach and has not dissipated in weeks roils away in confusion. He has *done nothing wrong,* and yet it feels like Lan Qiren could level his sternest gaze and dictate his harshest punishment, and Lan Wangji would deserve it. Wei Wuxian has *done everything wrong,* and he breezes through his days, beams with delight when he‚Äôs scolded, naps like a cat in the sunlight, without a trace of guilty conscience. \n\n*Do good, and goodness follows*‚Äîprinciple twenty-eight.\n\nSomething is profoundly disordered. Lan Wangji is still sorting out *what* when he walks home at dusk, taking the long way around to do some sitting by the waterfall. He is so lost in thought that he almost stumbles, halting abruptly when he spots someone there first. \n\nWei Wuxian is sprawled on the rock, deeply engrossed in a book. *Outside of class*‚Äîa book. Reading. Lan Wangji has to rearrange the mental disarray this causes, more things not in their right place. Probably, it is‚Äîno, he can‚Äôt think of something unkind to charge him with. A book is a book‚Äîalways good.[^2] Exactly which text it is, Lan Wangji can‚Äôt see, only that it‚Äôs not one of their textbooks. He glimpses an illustration.\n\nHis feet move of their own accord, drawing him over. Wei Wuxian jumps a mile, dropping the book and then scrambling after it. He sits upright, suddenly exhibiting the perfect posture that he has heretofore lacked, placing the book in his lap, folding his arms over it, offering Lan Wangji his most virtuous grin.\n\n‚ÄúLan Zhan!‚Äù he says brightly.\n\nLan Wangji reaches down for the book.\n\nWei Wuxian, bright red, yelps and slaps him away. He quickly sticks the book under him, sitting on it, pulling his skirts taut over his knees. \n\n‚ÄúDo not treat a book that way,‚Äù Lan Wangji says ferociously.\n\n‚ÄúHa! Can if I want to. It‚Äôs mine, Lan Zhan.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYours.‚Äù \n\n‚Äú*Mine,*‚Äù he repeats. He looks around them, shifting his attention placidly onto the view. ‚ÄúSo pretty here, Lan Zhan. Do you ever swim in the water? Bet it‚Äôs freezing. Bet there‚Äôs a rule.‚Äù He makes a face, dropping his voice into what is probably meant to be an imitation of Lan Qiren. ‚Äú*Swimming is prohibited in Cloud Recesses.*‚Äù \n\nWei Wuxian knows there is no such rule‚Äîhe would have copied it a hundred and forty-three times if there was. But, Lan Wangji concedes‚Äîthere is only no rule because such a rule has not been necessary. Gusu Lan disciples do not grow up swimming like fish.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt swim,‚Äù Lan Wangji says.\n\nWei Wuxian looks up, aghast. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt, or *can‚Äôt?* How can you not swim, Lan Zhan? Did you just never learn? In Yunmeng we learn to swim before we can walk. I would‚Äôve drowned if I couldn‚Äôt, all the times Jiang Cheng‚Äôs thrown me in the river.‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji, in this instance, can commiserate with Jiang Wanyin. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to deserve it?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHa! Ha-ha-ha. Lan Zhan, you‚Äôre so funny. Something bad happened to me, so of course I deserved it.‚Äù He is shaking his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd throw *you* in a river, Lan Zhan. Just for fun.‚Äù\n\nIt has happened again. Lan Wangji has been drawn into a conversation he had no intention of having. He has also been neatly sidetracked from the book‚Äîwhich he did not care about in the first place. He does the mental equivalent of rubbing his forehead, right where the pain throbs in his temple. \n\nWei Wuxian tidies his skirts, tucking them around his ankles, looking for all the world like he won‚Äôt move for the rest of the night. It reminds Lan Wangji of his purpose, the sitting and meditating he would like to be doing. ‚ÄúCurfew,‚Äù he says.\n\n‚ÄúCurfew?‚Äù Wei Wuxian echoes, looking up at the sky that is still light against the mountain.\n\n‚ÄúYou are breaking it.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù \n\nLan Wangji‚Äôs fingers clench reflexively around Bichen.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not dark yet, Lan Zhan. Anyone can see it‚Äôs not dark. Curfew is nightfall.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt will be nightfall,‚Äù Lan Wangji points out pedantically, mentally apologizing for rule one-eighty-five, ‚Äúby the time you reach your rooms.‚Äù \n\nWei Wuxian sulks. Then he goes still, tipping his head like he‚Äôs sighting a bird in a bush.\n\n‚ÄúBribery is prohibited,‚Äù Lan Wangji preempts him.\n\n‚ÄúNo, no no,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says, lost in thought. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that‚ÄîLan Zhan. That would mean *you‚Äôre* breaking curfew.‚Äù He taps his nose thoughtfully. ‚ÄúWhy would the beautiful Second Young Master Lan be risking his spotless reputation to sneak off after curfew? Lan Zhan!‚Äù His eyes widen. He affects a conspiratorial grin of delight. ‚ÄúDo you have a‚Ä¶ secret lover?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWei *Ying.*‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI know, I know, I know, I know. Secret. Is she pretty, Lan Zhan? Or‚Ä¶ he?‚Äù Wei Wuxian frowns thoughtfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to picture you kissing someone, Lan Zhan. Who would make you like them *that way?‚Äù* He makes a face over the failure of imagination he is apparently experiencing. \n\nLan Wangji is just standing there, breathing sharply.\n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt picture it. Lan Zhan is so pretty. Who would be good enough for him? They would have to be noble of bearing, and pleasing in virtue, and the most beautiful cultivator in the land‚Ä¶‚Äù He shakes his head woefully, then brightens. ‚ÄúMaybe they will come soon, and I will see for myself!‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji actually‚Äî*actually*‚Äîmakes a guttural sound of frustration. He has not done that since childhood.\n\n‚ÄúI know, I know,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says again. He tilts his head at Lan Wangji in pained sympathy. ‚ÄúYou are worried I will tell on you since you told on me. But I am not that kind of person, Lan Zhan.‚Äù He is devious, utterly devious, because he makes his dark eyes look genuinely wide with distress. ‚ÄúAre you worried, Lan Zhan? Would they punish you, for love? Are you going to have to write Conduct and Virtue one thousand times?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWei Ying,‚Äù he says, with deadly calm. \n\n‚ÄúLan Zhan, do not worry. I, your faithful friend Wei Ying, will stand by you to the end.‚Äù He lifts three fingers to his brow, which he holds for a moment before he splutters and tries to be solemn, but can‚Äôt and breaks into laughter. ‚ÄúLan Zhan, the look on your face. I should paint it. I‚Äôd need lots of red ink‚ÄîLan Zhan!‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji, with dignity, has turned to walk away. He keeps walking. Not caring. Let him break curfew. Let him break so many rules he has to do penance on his knees. Tie him down to a desk, see if he obeys then, hobble his ankles, put a silence spell on that mouth‚Äî\n\nAnother guttural sound, no one to hear but the trees.\n\n----\n\nLan Wangji does not like being toyed with. For a week he makes Wei Wuxian suffer through his impassive silence. He doesn‚Äôt glare, nor does he sulk, nor does he pointedly direct his righteous fury that way. He simply goes about his business as though Wei Wuxian does not exist, even during their afternoons in the library. \n\nIt is more effective than anything Lan Wangji has done all summer. Wei Wuxian suffers. He teases, he dawdles, he does everything he can think of that should earn him a scolding. Lan Wangji reads, unaffected, or transcribes his own perfect texts, paying attention only to the brush and his sleeves. Wei Wuxian acts like it‚Äôs agony, like no one has ever been so cruel to him as this. There is a lot of showy drama. After several days, he seems truly distressed, even apologizing in a roundabout way where he doesn‚Äôt directly admit fault, bringing Lan Wangji offerings, mostly fruit, which Lan Wangji doesn‚Äôt touch, letting it attract flies.\n\nIt is late afternoon, a gray day with rain pattering lightly on the roof, when the impasse finally ends. Wei Wuxian is attempting his own silent treatment, and is actually copying lines; Lan Wangji is deeply absorbed in a poem by Li Bai.[^3] There is a line of such beauty‚Äî*peach blossoms flow downstream*‚Äîthat Lan Wangji looks up to absorb it, the way he would if he was alone in his room. His eyes land on Wei Wuxian as if they wanted to rest there in the first place, and Wei Wuxian, mid-brush stroke, lifts his gaze. \n\nThe moment snags the way a petal would, caught in the eddy of a stream. Wei Wuxian looks at him, and then slowly, like the first pink of dawn spreading across the pearly gray sky, he smiles. A quiet, soft smile of irrepressible loveliness, followed by a slow, happy blink that says, *thank you, and sorry.* That says, *ah, there you are, you finally see me again.*\n\n----\n\nIt is the white robe, through the trees, that pulls Lan Wangji off the path. He does not know how he knows it‚Äôs Wei Wuxian‚Äîhe just does. It is not where it should be, for one; for another, there is talking. The words grow distinct as Lan Wangji draws closer‚Äîthey‚Äôre such nice bees, he‚Äôs saying, nice bees who wouldn‚Äôt want to ever sting anybody, especially anybody like him, who‚Äôs so nice too, and their friend, and just wants to taste some of this delicious honey they‚Äôve made, the most delicious in the world. \n\n‚ÄúA-Xian!‚Äù \n\nA bright, girlish laugh stops Lan Wangji‚Äôs heart. There is someone else with him, a second robe fluttering, which had been just out of sight. She stands on the ground; Wei Wuxian teeters above her, atop a large boulder, up to his elbows in the hollow trunk of a tree. \n\n‚ÄúCareful! Here, take it,‚Äù Wei Wuxian calls out, crouching to pass her something with both hands.[^4]\n\nHe is clouded in‚Äîbees. Everywhere, bees. The girl below him, undaunted by the swarm, shows no fear for him, or for herself. \n\n‚ÄúShijie!‚Äù he scolds her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drop it,‚Äù and Lan Wangji recognizes the purple sash and ribbons of Wei Wuxian‚Äôs sister. \n\n‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù she‚Äôs saying, which matches, with relief, the assessment Lan Wangji had made of her character: polite and conscientious, immune to mischief, soft-spoken and well-mannered, someone who could not be more unrelated to Wei Wuxian. \n\nExcept here she is, working in easy tandem, used to such things. Taking honeycombs from him, and placing them in a basket hanging over her arm. \n\n‚ÄúI asked Lan Zhan,‚Äù Wei Wuxian is saying. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. He said so. Shijie, how much do you want?‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji does not clear his throat, nor does he speak. He merely places himself in the middle of the clearing and waits for the thieving pair to notice. It is satisfying when they do. Jiang Yanli startles, by the base of the tree, quickly saying, ‚ÄúSecond Young Master Lan,‚Äù and dropping into a bow around the basket.\n\nWei Wuxian has the decency to turn pink. \n\nHe is where Lan Wangji places his steady gaze, since he is no doubt the instigator. Jiang Yanli is saying something about how gracious Second Young Master Lan is, to understand their request and grant them this privilege. \n\n‚ÄúMn,‚Äù Lan Wangji says, inclining his head slightly, since going along with the blatant lie is making Wei Wuxian squirm. \n\n‚ÄúSee! Shijie,‚Äù he says, laughing nervously, recovering his footing, literally and figuratively. ‚ÄúI told you Lan Zhan was kind, and not boring at all, and not the type of person who would be mean and not share nice things with his friends.‚Äù He is pressing his luck, watching to see how far Lan Wangji will go with him as he plays out this rope. \n\nLan Wangji is curious about that himself. ‚ÄúMn,‚Äù he says again. \n\nThere is more to the chorus from Jiang Yanli, how thankful she is, how the Lan clan is so hospitable, how already she feels better and wishes to know if‚Äî\n\n‚ÄúA-Jie!‚Äù A shout interrupts them from the foot of the hill. \n\n‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs a-Cheng,‚Äù she says, throwing a look at Wei Wuxian. She looks pained, torn between loyalty, politeness, and duty. Fortunately, for Lan Wangji, these obligations are in harmony. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wish to rush off, but he will‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôll excuse me,‚Äù she says. Demurely, she bows to Lan Wangji again, holding it an extra moment of courtesy. ‚ÄúA-Xian‚Ä¶‚Äù She trades a communicative glance with her brother, then skirts politely around Lan Wangji, a safe distance away before she calls out, ‚ÄúA-Cheng, I‚Äôm here! We found it,‚Äù picking her way through the trees. \n\nWei Wuxian, still on the boulder, waits for her to go before he spreads his arms, swoops down across the short distance, and lands face to face with Lan Wangji. A few bees fly with him, circling them both, until they find nothing of interest and desultorily return to the swarm in the tree. \n\n‚ÄúStealing,‚Äù Lan Wangji says, refusing to take a step backwards to keep proper distance between them.\n\n‚ÄúNot stealing.‚Äù Wei Wuxian holds up two bare forearms, sleeves rolled up past his elbows. He shows Lan Wangji, front and back. A few scratches have raised faint little dotted ribbons of blood to the surface of his skin. No stings. ‚ÄúI asked nicely. The nice bees said yes. Didn‚Äôt hurt me. And it‚Äôs *their* honey, not yours.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLying.‚Äù Lan Wangji continues his list. \n\n‚ÄúOnly so shijie wouldn‚Äôt feel bad. And I *did* try to find you! Not my fault you hide from me all the time.‚Äù Another lie, and a glimmer of pleasure in telling it. Wei Wuxian‚Äôs eyes are warm brown at this distance, like rosewood polished to a gleam. \n\nLan Wangji holds his gaze. ‚ÄúIndecent attire.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFine, fine fine,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says, finally hearing a crime he‚Äôll admit to. He flaps his arms in a shrug. ‚ÄúBare skin! It‚Äôs so scandalous. Lan Zhan will maul me before we‚Äôre even out of the forest! My virtue will never recover.‚Äù He reaches to untie his sleeves and realizes his hands are sticky with honey, and tree bark, and a good deal of dirt. He shrugs again, dropping his arms sheepishly. \n\nLan Wangji makes a calculation. He turns and starts walking. \n\n‚ÄúLan Zhan‚Äîwhat the‚Äî‚Äù Wei Wuxian huffs. Lan Wangji does not look back. He knows the way through the trees; when he stops, Wei Wuxian has trailed after him warily, and stops too, a short distance away. \n\nLan Wangji waits for him to see it. When he does, his eyes widen a fraction, then narrow and stare at Lan Wangji askance. Begrudgingly, he crouches down to start scrubbing his hands in the trickling spring. \n\nIt is quiet a moment. They are away from the bees. The trees shift in the mild breeze; the water laughs on the rocks. \n\n‚ÄúShijie gets headaches,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says presently, his wrists red from the water, which pours from the rock cold and clear as ice. He is still scrubbing, not looking up. ‚ÄúBad ones, sometimes. And fevers. It‚Äôs always worse when it‚Äôs rainy, like it has been.‚Äù\n\nIt is sudden, the change in his voice, stripped of all guile, leaving only sincerity. Lan Wangji says nothing, which Wei Wuxian interprets‚Äîas always‚Äîas a request to continue. \n\n‚ÄúSo bad sometimes that even the light hurts,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much that helps, but it was very bad the other day, so I went to Wen Qing for medicines.‚Äù He makes a face. ‚ÄúYou should taste it, Lan Zhan. It‚Äôs the worst thing I‚Äôve tasted, worse than your bitter tonic soup. At home we‚Äôd have wild honey, you know, to make bad things taste better. So I guess I talked about it a lot, which made us both homesick, which made shijie feel worse so I had to make her feel better. I told her, shijie, surely there is wild honey around. Your beloved brother Wei Ying will find it. And I did.‚Äù\n\nHe stands up, shaking his hands dry. Lan Wangji realizes with startling clarity that it is easy to tell when Wei Wuxian is telling the truth. He drops the lies, playful or otherwise, the way someone would lower a sword and leave themselves unguarded. \n\n‚ÄúShe would have been so embarrassed if you caught us,‚Äù Wei Wuxian continues. ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt asked you permission. So thank you, Lan Zhan.‚Äù After a moment, he adds contritely, ‚ÄúI can write more lines if I need to.‚Äù\n\nThe woods are dappled with sunlight at this hour of the day. Wei Wuxian still has not rolled down his sleeves. His hands are brown from the sun, as are his arms, all the way up to his elbows‚Äîeven though the skin is chapped now, red from the scrubbing. But there is no line where pale skin starts, the telltale sign of how often his sleeves are not where they should be.\n\nLan Wangji knows the trick of averting his gaze when his eyes speak too much. He employs it now, just like he had employed it a moment ago to avoid Wei Wuxian‚Äôs eyes when they were being honest and dangerous. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says. \n\n‚ÄúNo?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMore lines. There is no need.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh,‚Äù says Wei Wuxian uncertainly, like bait he has dangled has been ignored by the fish. ‚ÄúAh! Well, that‚Äôs good then.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúMn,‚Äù Lan Wangji says. \n\nAfter a moment, he turns to walk away. Wei Wuxian falls in alongside him, stepping close as they pass through a narrow gap in the trees. He unrolls his sleeves, which fall around him and flutter like cabbage moths in the garden.[^5]\n\n‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs good then, back there, that I didn‚Äôt offer you honeycombs. I would have,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf it was just up to me. But I thought Lan Zhan would say, *bribery is prohibited.* Principle two-thirty-eight.‚Äù\n\nHe pauses to see if Lan Wangji will respond to this.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd have to copy a thousand more texts,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says faithfully. ‚ÄúDie of old age in the library. Hundreds of years from now, your Lan disciples would say what‚Äôs that in the corner? And you‚Äôd say, that‚Äôs Wei Ying, a pile of dust, because he gave Lan Wangji honeycombs‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHow do you not get stung?‚Äù Lan Wangji blurts abruptly. \n\n‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Wei Wuxian says, withdrawing the arm he had jovially bumped against Lan Wangji‚Äôs sleeve. ‚ÄúOh, that? Bees are nice, like I said.‚Äù He waves it off. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre calm, they‚Äôre calm too. Have you ever been stung? You might have made them mad, or scared them. That stern face of yours, Lan Zhan. That would do it. As long as they aren‚Äôt hurt or scared, they‚Äôre just happy little bees, buzzing around. I can show you‚ÄîLan Zhan.‚Äù\n\nWei Wuxian collides with him, this time because Lan Wangji has stopped in the middle of sun-dappled greenery. Wei Wuxian looks at him, miffed. \n\n‚ÄúButterbur,‚Äù Lan Wangji says.[^6]\n\n‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù Wei Wuxian says. He is smart, so Lan Wangji waits for him to make the leap between the word and the leafy foliage at their feet. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù he says, when he does. ‚ÄúButterbur. For‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúHeadaches.‚Äù\n\nWei Wuxian looks at him a long time. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he says finally, sounding lost, even though they are now only a stone‚Äôs throw from the path. He trails his gaze down again, looking around them, the sea of giant, cup-shaped, almost lotus-like leaves. \n\n‚ÄúDry the roots, or boil the leaves. Drink the tea,‚Äù Lan Wangji says. \n\nWei Wuxian scratches his elbow, looking supremely uncomfortable. ‚ÄúThanks?‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúLan Zhan? Can you please not do this again?‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji frowns. \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much more fun when I do something and you say, *ridiculous.* Or try to get me in trouble. I don‚Äôt know what to *do* with you when you‚Äôre like this, all‚Äî‚Äù He makes a helpless sound of distaste, gesturing up and down at Lan Wangji‚Äôs person. \n\nLan Wangji frowns longer, then turns to walk away. Wei Wuxian skips around him, circling in front of him, grabbing his arm. \n\n‚ÄúSee! That‚Äôs much better! Now get mad, say something mean, call me names‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet go,‚Äù Lan Wangji says. \n\nWei Wuxian drops his hand immediately. He steps backwards, which means he stumbles, and catches himself, and bumps against a tree. \n\n‚ÄúOw,‚Äù he says. \n\nLan Wangji traps him there, stepping closer. Wei Wuxian goes still, like a deer who knows instinctively it has been sighted as prey.\n\n‚ÄúLan Zhan,‚Äù he says, and laughs nervously. Just a soft, shaky *ha,* otherwise perfectly willing, Lan Wangji notices, to be pinned against a tree.[^7] He watches as Wei Wuxian swallows, the knot sliding up and down the line of his throat.\n\nIt‚Äôs too late. He‚Äôs too close. He has made a grave miscalculation. He cannot think past the soft shape of Wei Wuxian‚Äôs mouth. \n\nDesire splits him open, like an unpruned sapling too green to carry summer‚Äôs ripe fruit.[^8] He is trembling with want. He wants to‚Äîhe doesn‚Äôt even *know enough* to know exactly all the things that he wants, a lack of knowledge that fills him with violent frustration. He wants to *kiss him.* Pale words for what he wants to do. He wants to maul him, bite him, lick him like the honey he hasn‚Äôt been given; bruise him like overripe fruit. He wants Wei Wuxian‚Äôs hands on him, grasping, Wei Wuxian *kissing him back.* He would need to pin his wrists then, grip his hips, do whatever it takes to wrest back control, hold on to some frayed scrap of his dignity even as the kiss grows longer, and‚Äîand gentler, and deeper, and‚Äî\n\nScalded, Lan Wangji takes a step back. Wei Wuxian sways forward, like they‚Äôre tethered, reaching after him without thinking before they both freeze in unison, one step apart, staring. Wei Wuxian looks addled, like the surface of a pond where someone has just chucked in a stone.\n\nLan Wangji desperately wants to hear footsteps coming up the path. Something that will pull them apart; a flock of encroaching disciples, even ones who whisper *jade princess,* cast sly looks at Wei Wuxian and stifle giggles in class.\n\nNothing happens. No rescue comes. Lan Wangji blinks; Wei Wuxian frowns. He blinks again, giving his head a brief shake to clear it. ‚ÄúWei Ying,‚Äù he says. His gaze is resting on the folds of blue and white cloth at the base of his throat. \n\nSomething moves. Wei Wuxian looks down. Carefully, haltingly, he parts the top layers of his robe. The little yellow bee, hidden there, flicks her wings, scrubs her legs. Wei Wuxian lifts her out, coaxing her onto the tip of his finger.[^9] The bee perches there for a moment, Wei Wuxian‚Äôs eyes going wide and delighted, almost crossing over each other in order to peer at her more closely. Another elegant flick of her wings, she takes flight, looping over their heads, finally zagging sharply off towards the nearest patch of blossoms.\n\nWei Wuxian‚Äôs laughter is soft and carefree, eyes shining, no longer the least bit off balance. He grins at Lan Wangji and recites, ‚ÄúNever hurt insects or plants,‚Äù the eleventh Lan principle. \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äî‚Äù Lan Wangji says, and fights back the words. \n\n‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says, which shows he has no idea what Lan Wangji was going to say. Lan Wangji doesn‚Äôt know either, except it wasn‚Äôt anything that would have Wei Wuxian saying, ‚ÄúShijie will think I‚Äôve gotten lost in the woods,‚Äù and tucking his robes tight together, skipping the short distance down to the path that winds its way down the mountain. \n\nThen he darts back up, sheepishly grinning as he plucks a few stalks of butterbur, wriggling them loose from the earth so the plugs of roots come up with them. \n\n‚ÄúComing, Lan Zhan?‚Äù he calls from below, once he is back on the path. \n\nLan Wangji shakes his head brusquely. Wei Wuxian tosses him a wave and that bright, undaunted smile, and whistles a little as he wanders away.\n\n----\n\nIn the cold springs, Lan Wangji doesn‚Äôt remove his robes. He sits with the water up to his shoulders, his submerged posture impeccable. His fingers have gone numb by the time they shrivel into prunes. \n\n‚ÄúWangji.‚Äù A polite cough. ‚ÄúWangji? ‚Ä¶Wangji.‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji looks up and blinks. He is not sure how long his brother has been sitting there, bare-shouldered, the tail of his ribbons floating in the water. It seems like maybe a while. He looks amused. \n\n‚ÄúI said, your lips are blue,‚Äù Xichen says gently. \n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lan Wangji says, rising, reaching for his robe to pull around him‚Äîwhich he is already wearing. He climbs out of the pool, trailing water. It follows him up the path, along with the sound that is either Xichen‚Äôs soft laughter or the wind in the trees. \n\n----\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lan Wangji says, to everything.\n\nIt becomes the pattern of his days. No to Wei Wuxian, who bounces up alongside him with schemes or smiles, or loquats, or warmth he pours out like cups of Lan Wangji‚Äôs favorite tea. No to Xichen (who has acquired the untimely habit of saying *yes*). No to company, while hunting water ghosts. No to absurd, clever theories. No to the half dozen flirtations he has to fend off before noon. No so exhaustively, so reflexively, so nonsensically, that Wei Wuxian makes it a game, counting it as a victory when he can get Lan Wangji to say anything else.\n\nLan Wangji *would* say something else if he knew what to do; if he knew how else to survive this. \n\nHe reaches the ends of his days sweaty with exhaustion. There is no one he can turn to. Uncle‚Äîhis mind balks. The last place to breathe any words that could connect back to Wei Wuxian is in Lan Qiren‚Äôs presence. Xichen is no longer a refuge. Even if Lan Wangji were to present his dilemma in hypothetical form, all identifying details removed, Xichen would just smile indulgently, nod sagely, and murmur unhelpful encouragement about cultivating friendships. Lan Wangji loves his brother, but‚Äî*honestly.* \n\nEven books fail him. The poets have two poles on the subject: infatuation, and heartbreak. The books of wisdom offer the same word Lan Wangji already has: *no,* but with nothing else helpful like *how.* Any texts with illustrations give him heart palpitations. He approaches blue covers now the way he would approach a snake in the grass. \n\nIronically, miserably, it‚Äôs in Wei Wuxian‚Äôs presence where he feels like he would have a confidant. Wei Wuxian is undaunted by anything. He would put his clever mind to it, and be kind like with his sister‚Äîno. Not on this matter. On this matter he would crow with delight and‚Äîprobably climb in Lan Wangji‚Äôs lap, exhibit *no restraint*‚Äî\n\nLan Wangji is sweaty again. He devotes every spare minute to more cultivation. Even Xichen grows concerned, tells him‚Äî*lies to him*‚Äîthat it‚Äôs not a crime nor a sin to enjoy himself. A boy his age, he‚Äôs allowed to not be so strict on himself all the time. Pleasure, fun‚Äîthese are words Xichen uses, a foreign language that Lan Wangji is suddenly expected to know. \n\nMore expectations placed on him. He is aware that even the most sturdy bow snaps under ill-applied pressure, strung with too tight a string. \n\nHe is not a bow, though. Nor a boy. He is‚Äîhe is *Lan.* \n\nAnd he is lost. \n\n---- \n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lan Wangji says, when there‚Äôs liquor. \n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lan Wangji says, when he‚Äôs drunk. \n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says wildly, panicked, when Wei Wuxian‚Äîalso drunk‚Äîis just going to crawl in bed beside him, yawning. \n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he says, more painfully, softly, when Wei Wuxian tries to leave. \n\n‚ÄúLan Zhan, I have never known anybody more ridiculous than you are,‚Äù Wei Wuxian grumbles, but then does what he always does, finds the space between those two *no‚Äôs* and folds himself back down to sit on the floor by the bed.\n\nHe unties his sash, his outer robe. He flings the sash away in the same motion that Lan Wangji bolts upright. \n\n‚ÄúLan Zhan! *Calm down.*‚Äù Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúYou can have one or the other. You can have the bed, or you can have me fully dressed. Can‚Äôt have both.‚Äù\n\nHe takes a swig from the jar, missing half of it with his mouth, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, which distracts Lan Wangji temporarily from the discarded sash. Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes again, placing both hands on Lan Wangji‚Äôs shoulders to ease him back down on the bed. \n\n‚ÄúSee? More comfortable. Yes?‚Äù Wei Wuxian says in the patient way people speak to small children. He perches his chin on his hand, observing Lan Wangji for a moment. ‚ÄúAre you going to sleep now? Or call me Wei-gege again?‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji‚Äôs ears blaze with heat. He can keep the color off his face if he stares up at the ceiling.\n\n‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù Wei Wuxian muses. ‚ÄúNot harsh, but refreshing. Soft, yet full bodied. Mature and fragrant.‚Äù His eyes widen, happy to put on a display of innocence when Lan Wangji turns to look at him. ‚ÄúDescribing the liquor, Lan Zhan. You‚Äôre supposed to do that when you drink. All the poets do it.‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji‚Äôs description would be *vile.* He keeps that thought to himself, returning to stare unblinking at the ceiling. He can sense instead of see the face Wei Wuxian makes‚Äîhis *Lan Zhan is so boring* face, a fact they‚Äôve well established‚Äîbut he is silent for a moment, which gives Lan Wangji‚Äôs question the chance to come tumbling out. ‚ÄúWhat else does one do when one drinks?‚Äù\n\n*Fun,* Xichen‚Äôs word, the language he is supposed to be learning. One might as well ask an expert. \n\n‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says, taking it seriously. ‚ÄúDumb stuff. Laugh a lot‚Äîthings are funnier when you‚Äôre drunk. One time Jiang Cheng dared me to steal a boat, and I did, but it leaked, and we sank.‚Äù He grins to himself, basking in the memory, then shrugs with one shoulder. ‚ÄúYou just play around. Do what you want. Tease the boy you like.‚Äù\n\nLan Wangji cuts his eyes at him. \n\n‚ÄúKiss the boy you like.‚Äù Wei Wuxian takes a small sip of liquor. \n\nLan Wangji feels the same jolt as when he walked in the room, the sudden little violent reaction at finding Wei Wuxian piled beneath the boys on the bed. Is this what he does when he drinks? Lose all inhibitions, let *someone else*‚Äî\n\n‚ÄúLan Zhan?‚Äù Wei Wuxian says, amused. \n\nThe silence has gone on too long. It is telling, because Wei Wuxian has set aside the jar and folded his arms on the bed, regarding Lan Wangji with interest. \n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lan Wangji says. \n\nThe familiar response makes a smile bloom on Wei Wuxian‚Äôs face, warm and just as familiar.\n\n‚ÄúOkay. Lan Zhan? Because you could,‚Äù he says patiently. ‚ÄúKiss me, I mean. Just as friends. I wouldn‚Äôt mind. I would‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lan Wangji says. It doesn‚Äôt sound like his voice. \n\nWei Wuxian scoots up a little, propping up on his elbows. Lan Wangji, taken leave of all of his senses, responds without thinking, raising up on one arm to meet him. \n\nWei Wuxian looks into his eyes. That lasts for several long moments. Then he is frowning, saying, ‚ÄúJust a little‚Ä¶‚Äù and tipping Lan Wangji‚Äôs head for him. Lan Wangji has already done something wrong, not known how to fit‚Äîwith their noses. Even drunk, he is lost, all the way outside the bounds of his meagre experience, unable to know what any sensible person would know how to do‚Äî\n\nThe kiss happens then. Neatly, chastely. Lips are pressed against his. It is‚Äîdry, a little strange. Lan Wangji feels detached, unsure if he‚Äôs missed an important instruction. There is no precedent for it. *This is kissing,* occurs in the back of his mind. \n\nWei Wuxian opens his eyes, pulling back. He looks‚Äînot *disappointed,* but doubtful. Lan Wangji has doubts too. He also has vast experience of the look on Wei Wuxian‚Äôs face when he sets his formidable mind against an unforeseen complication. Lan Wangji meets him partway that time, when Wei Wuxian leans back in. \n\nBetter. Still chaste, still dry lips against lips, but Wei Wuxian has softened his mouth. Lan Wangji does the same, never one to let someone outmatch him. A string of soft kisses then, two, three, four, each one polite and studious. Lan Wangji makes a sound of dissatisfaction. \n\nWei Wuxian shuffles up closer. He licks his lips, places his hand boldly on Lan Wangji‚Äôs chest, leans in and delivers what the kiss has been missing. \n\nThis time it‚Äî*oh.* Lan Wangji‚Äôs lips part. He lifts up, chasing the kiss, a change of angle, and pressure‚Äîtheir lips slot together. It is wet now, and warm‚Äîan impossibly soft, silky heat that snags on his lips and spills down through him the way the liquor had done. *Kissing,* it‚Äôs‚Äîa little breathless, like drowning, or flying. Wei Wuxian climbs up closer; Lan Wangji‚Äôs hand slides around the nape of his neck. They both make a small sound at that, startled. The kiss grows more clumsy, more pressing, Wei Wuxian the one learning places his hands can go. \n\nIt‚Äôs‚Äîthey pull apart. They pant a little, hands stuck in each others‚Äô hair. \n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äî!‚Äù Wei Wuxian protests, letting him go with an alacrity that makes Lan Wangji‚Äôs heart give a hard painful kick, until he realizes Wei Wuxian is staring at his ribbon, askew across his forehead.\n\n‚ÄúRidiculous,‚Äù Lan Wangji says hoarsely, and pulls him back in.\n\nThe kiss changes that time, again. Wei Wuxian is almost in his arms, and it makes awareness slide through them, of what exactly they‚Äôre doing. The kiss deepens, and slips, and then‚ÄîLan Wangji doesn‚Äôt even know quite how it happens. They‚Äôre still kissing‚Äîhis hand on Wei Wuxian‚Äôs chest‚Äîbut each kiss recedes, one by one. Like the tide going out. Safer kisses, softer kisses, circling around and arriving back at the polite, uncertain beginning. Lan Wangji lets him go, his hands empty when the last kiss breaks apart. \n\n‚ÄúAh,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says, and clears his throat. ‚ÄúLan Zhan, that was‚Ä¶‚Äù He smiles a little, and rallies. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt bad. That was good.‚Äù He pats Lan Wangji‚Äôs chest, job well done, and musters a different smile for him, cheerful and obliging. He looks mussed and‚Äîwell-kissed, and unspeakably lovely, silver hairpiece askew, outer robe slipping down off his shoulder, his lower lip red where Lan Wangji bit and tugged it at the end. \n\n‚ÄúAh, you can‚Äîyou can forget all about this in the morning,‚Äù Wei Wuxian says reassuringly, patting his chest again. ‚ÄúNever happened. I mean, I‚Äôll probably remember a little, just because it was‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù Lan Wangji dies a little when he doesn‚Äôt finish that sentence. ‚ÄúBut I wouldn‚Äôt ever‚Äîjust two friends, drinking. Wouldn‚Äôt ever make you lose face. Promise, Lan Zhan. We don‚Äôt ever have to talk about it again.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lan Wangji says, but the sound doesn‚Äôt quite come out. Wei Wuxian slips away, off the mattress, bedding himself down on the floor. His head appears again, too abruptly. \n\n‚Äú*Aren‚Äôt* we friends now?‚Äù \n\nLan Wangji, who is flat on his back again, staring fixedly at the ceiling, shakes his head. \n\nWei Wuxian sighs. ‚ÄúThink we *are,*‚Äù he mumbles under his breath. ‚ÄúGave you my bed. Got you drunk. Had fun. Talked.‚Äù He sounds like he is counting on his fingers as he rattles this off, perversely leaving off *kissed.* ‚ÄúI do so much for you, Lan Zhan, and you don‚Äôt even say, ‚ÄòWei Ying, here, you‚Äôre so generous, you should have half of the bed, which is yours in the first place, I would not be so rude‚Äî‚Äô‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Lan Wangji finally manages to get the word out. \n\n‚Äú*Fine.*‚Äù Wei Wuxian grunts, sounding suspiciously like he is grinning all over. There is too much noise as he shuffles around, fumbling and settling and trying to get comfortable.\nAnd then there is too much quiet. \n\nHis head pops up again. ‚ÄúHey, Lan Zhan, I have books! Sometimes I read, when I can‚Äôt sleep‚Äî‚Äù\n\n‚Äú*No,*‚Äù Lan Wangji says, so forcefully that there is no doubt this time about Wei Wuxian‚Äôs grin. He beams at him, draping his arm across the foot of the bed, the position in which he has apparently decided to sleep. \n\n‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù he says blithely, poking Lan Wangji‚Äôs ankle before he closes his eyes. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt complain at me in the morning, when you haven‚Äôt slept and have a headache so bad you can‚Äôt open your eyes, because you didn‚Äôt take my advice, and then everybody says, what‚Äôs wrong with Lan Zhan, usually he‚Äôs so mean but now he just looks adorable, I feel sorry for him, I think he must actually be a very nice person‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n----\n\nIt‚Äôs almost alarming, in hindsight, how little anything changes. \n\nLan Wangji wakes up the next morning‚ÄîWei Wuxian doubled over laughing, trying to shake him awake, pull him up off the *floor*‚Äîmortification scalding the entire surface of Lan Wangji‚Äôs skin‚Äîbut none of it forces a reckoning, nor a major point of departure, nor a fork in the road from which he is unable to return.\n\nAll of that happened weeks ago‚Äî*months.* That‚Äôs the truth that dawns on him through the course of the day. He has already discovered so much new terrain in himself that he just‚Ä¶ feels like himself. A little bitchy, a little terrified; miserable with longing and unrepentant and still utterly lost as to what he will do. \n\nWei Wuxian doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. He squawks in protest at their punishment; he chases Lan Wangji through the cold springs. He is just like himself too, infuriating and loyal and‚Äîoddly quiet, robes dripping, watching Lan Wangji tie his ribbon around their wrists. \n\n*That* should feel strange, at least. New. A fundamental shift between them; instead, it feels like it has for the last half of the year, a fate that has stuck them together, half-wedded, half-doomed. \n\nNone of it can last. This Lan Wangji knows. There is no future for them with Wei Wuxian happily ensconced at his side. He does not belong here, with three thousand rules and bitter soup served at mealtimes and the sour-faced, severe Second Jade who takes it as courtesy when his personality is described as merely aloof. \n\nThis boy who calls his sword *Whatever.* This young man of grace, mischief, and beauty, too wild-hearted for the Gusu Lan to contain.\n\nLan Wangji knows all of this, and still it slides into his heart like a blade, Wei Wuxian painting lanterns, pledging words about duty and justice, wishing to have a clear conscience all the days of his life. \n\nAnd that‚Äî*that* feels like a turning point. A thousand tiny fires trapped inside him,[^10] lifting up like the lanterns away from the mountain, into the sky.\n\n\n[^1]: My first departure from TV canon, since it shows perfectly inked pages when WWX wakes up under his homework (ep 3).
