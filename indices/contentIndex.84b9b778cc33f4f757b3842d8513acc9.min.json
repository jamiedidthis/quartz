Untrammeled sexual love was “the strongest and deepest element in all life, the harbinger of hope, of joy, of ecstasy; love, the defier of all laws, of all conventions; the freest, the most powerful molder of human destiny; how can such an all-compelling force be synonymous with that poor little State- and Church-begotten weed, marriage?” 76\n\nIn 1916, she had spent two more weeks behind bars for defying the country’s Victorian-era laws against distributing information on birth control-deliberately choosing jail rather than pay a fine. Having worked as a midwife in the slums of the Lower East Side, she knew firsthand what a lifesaver effective birth control could be. Women, she said, should be free to open their minds and close their wombs. 76\n\nDespite all the other currents of violence in American life, nothing quite equaled the sadistic fury that met any hint of Black assertion. 107\n\nA sensationalist local newspaper, which supported the Democrats, magnified the friction by printing lurid stories of Black crime. Many were untrue, for the county jail’s population had actually dropped in 1916. ::Truth, however, has often counted for little when it comes to race in America, and white resentment continued to smolder.:: 110\n\nIn this city, as in others across the country, workers continued to feel the sharp pinch of wartime inflation. White labor unions had been pressing hard for higher wages and had thought they now had a chance of success because the war had dried up the stream of new in-migrants from overseas willing to work for low pay. But suddenly here were Blacks glad to do so, for whom the meager existing wages might be double what they had earned as southern farmworkers. In the eyes of white workers, fearful of losing ground, this threatened to depress their own wages or lose them their jobs entirely. These Black competitors became just what immigrants had been: someone to hate, and their skin color made them dangerously conspicuous. 110\n\nConfiscated from IWW workers by APL (American Protection League): Victor Hugo’s novel Les Misérables, and one each of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar and Frederic W. Farrar’s The Life of Christ 123\n\nIn the words of the historian David Brion Davis, “The years from 1917 to 1921 are probably unmatched in American history for popular hysteria, xenophobia, and paranoid suspicion.” 132\n\nConscientious objectors (Hutterites) in Alcatraz and Leavenworth 147\n\nWith so many war opponents indicted or already behind bars and no real German spies to be found, ::the American Protective League needed targets.:: Draft-dodging “slackers” provided one. Nothing aroused the rage of middle-aged APL members more than young men who might be failing to fight. In addition, the government offered a $50 bonus to anybody who caught such a man. Worth more than $1,000 today, such a reward was tempting because you could seize a suspected “slacker” without a warrant. APL members leapt at the chance. 151\n\nmost beer brewers were of German descent, rage against Germans ::fueled the decades-long drive for Prohibition:: that was now approaching victory: Germans were accused of trying to kill Americans with drink as well as bullets. \n\n::Now a local vigilante group, the Citizens Patriotic League, packed a school board session with an angry crowd and forced all teaching of German to stop. Nearby communities followed suit, and German books began disappearing from public library shelves.:: 154\n\nThe killing drew little outrage. “In spite of such excesses as lynchings,” commented the Washington Post a week later, “it is a healthful and wholesome awakening in the interior part of the country.” 157\n\nGeorge Creel: “if ads could sell face cream and soap, why not a war?” 175\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, alert to any movement that threatened his own martial vision of America, once called the party’s growth “far more ominous than any populist or similar movement in times past.” The Socialists seemed “ominous” to him because they commanded considerable support and could not be condemned as violent revolutionaries, for they competed at the polls. 182\n\nIn half a dozen cities in 1917, including Chicago, worried Republicans and Democrats had agreed to support a single “fusion” candidate for various posts to keep the Socialists from winning a plurality. Socialists increased their representation from two to ten seats in the New York State Assembly. Jubilant party members knew that if they did equally well in the 1918 midterm national elections, their vote total could for the first time be in the millions.\nFor Wilson, however, whose Democrats controlled the House of Representatives by only the narrowest of margins, it would be unthinkable to allow an antiwar party to gain the balance of power in the next Congress. The president was determined to crush the Socialists. 183\n\n::The pandemic::\n\n::What made the pandemic even more eerie was the lack of honest news.:: While the war raged, none of the nations fighting it wanted to reveal to their enemies the disease’s immense toll. One of the few major countries not to muzzle its press was neutral Spain. Especially when its king fell ill, the nation’s journalists published abundant reports on the mysterious scourge; such material could be safely reprinted elsewhere. Hence the pandemic was informally misnamed “the Spanish Flu.”\nAmerican newspapers had already learned the wartime habit of keeping stories upbeat. “As terrifying as the disease was,” writes the historian John Barry, “the press made it more so. They terrified by making little of it, for what officials and the press said bore no relationship to what people saw and touched and smelled and endured.” The chief of health and sanitation for the American wartime shipbuilding program, for example, blithely declared that the virus was “nothing more or less than old-fashioned grippe.” 193\n\nContinuing fighting after armistice, esp black regiments\n\nThe economist John Maynard Keynes was in the British delegation.\n“It was commonly believed at the commencement of the Paris Conference,” he wrote, “that the President had thought out, with the aid of a large body of advisers, a comprehensive scheme not only for the League of Nations but for the embodiment of the Fourteen Points in an actual Treaty of Peace. But in fact the President had thought out nothing… He had no plan, no scheme, no constructive ideas whatever for clothing with the flesh of life the commandments which he had thundered from the White House. He could have preached a sermon on any of them or have addressed a stately prayer to the Almighty for their fulfillment; but he could not frame their concrete application to the actual state of Europe.” 206\n\nThe Seattle mayor opposing strikes: “everything about his law-and-order stance emphasized masculinity.” And “Americanism stands for one wife and one country.” 222\n\n::“The Red Scare praise of male heroes underscored the notion that the nation needed patriarchal power to withstand domestic subversion.”:: 224\n\n::Called for a ban on the teaching of any modern foreign language in American elementary schools:: 230\n\nGood detective work is difficult, but finding scapegoats is always easy 240\n\nNearly 40% of Americans today have at least one ancestor that entered through Ellis island 247\n\nLynching an 8 mo pregnant woman upside down, doused her with gasoline and set her on fire, cut her belly open and stomped her baby to death. No one was ever persecuted 251\n\nThe “race riots of 1919” almost all began as white riots 252\n\nThrew rocks at a black child at the beach, killing him; police wouldn’t arrest the white men, but a black man instead 253\n\nthe “Red Summer” of 1919, from Connecticut to South Carolina, and from Texas to Washington, DC, where 2,000 soldiers were called out. Vigilantes burned more than a dozen Black churches in Georgia alone. 254\n\nThe outline of what happened in Omaha was gruesomely similar to hundreds of other lynchings in this era. But the story has another layer. Like other American cities, Omaha was not without racism to begin with, but, as so often happens, an ambitious politician deliberately inflamed it. The story of what he did, however, would not fully emerge for years. 257\n\nPolitical boss wanted to oust the current “reform-minded” mayor, published sensational headlines about black assault and rape, knew black men would be arrested and killed without trial—his men in blackface committing the crimes 257\n\nthe county continued to boil, with strikes in critical industries, the worst racial violence in half a century, and ongoing combat in the war between the Right and Left. Domestic warfare 283\n\nMob behavior ruled, political theater; Wilson as incapacitated as dad 287\n\nthe Supreme Court had upheld—unanimously—the Espionage and Sedition Acts, the legal foundations for the national crackdown on dissent. And if that wasn’t enough, so eager were politicians to show their toughness that they would introduce some 70 different additional sedition bills in Congress in late 1919 and early 1920.\nIn November 1919, however, something happened that didn’t immediately change any of this, but offered a flicker of hope. ::A man was large enough to change his mind.:: It was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the justice who had written that unanimous Supreme Court decision upholding the two acts. He didn’t *say* he had changed his mind, but he showed it. 289\n\nFighting a war to make the world safe for democracy, while eviscerating any dissent at home 300\n\nPalmer, the “man’s man,” evoking every possible fear voters might have, from violent upheaval to uppity females 303 (working in tandem with Hoover)\n\nHoover’s goons classifying works by Thomas Paine as “anarchistic” 309\n\nLouis Post, temporarily in charge of labor dept, stopped the mass deportations, stood up to Hoover, deep integrity 307–312\n\nPalmer, staking his presidential bid on maintaining the red scare at full throttle 313\n\nThe stark failure of Palmer’s May Day predictions put a humiliating dent in his presidential hopes, and also knocked the breath out of the campaign for a new sedition bill; none of the many proposed in Congress passed. The nation’s daily newspapers, almost all of which had uncritically headlined Palmer’s warnings without making any attempt to verify them, felt taken for a ride. Some broke ranks with the Red Scare for the first time. 322\n\n::The illusion of a sinister radical menace guarantees big budgets.:: 323\n\nWhy was Palmer, instead of concentrating on such issues—which actually might have served him well politically—so obsessed by the certainty of a Communist uprising? He was, one writer comments, “a demagogue who believed his own demagoguery.” In the end, he proved as blind as many would-be revolutionaries to the fact that most Americans have seldom dreamed of an armed left-wing revolution. 323\n\nLouis Post eviscerating them with intelligence, charm, and humor 324\n\nPost treated the committee as if they were students, and to teach them he used the full range of rhetorical skills he had developed as a traveling single-tax lecturer. During ten hours of testimony spread over two days, he gave the committee a graduate-level class in immigration law and the way the Justice Department had completely ignored constitutional protections for those it arrested.\nHe leavened all this with a needle-sharp wit, which none of the con-gressmen, almost all of them lawyers accustomed to making witnesses squirm, seemed to expect. When Post referred to something as being common knowledge, the committee’s chair expressed skepticism, say-ing, “I am not impressed with the truth of everything I hear.”\n“Neither am I, Post shot back. “If I had been I would have deported every man that the detectives arrested.” 324\n\n“Some day, when the history of American liberty comes to be written,” declared the liberal *Nation*, “the name of Louis F. Post will be given a high place, because he dared in a trying time to defy the forces of madness and hatred and greed that now threaten to overwhelm us.” 325\n\n“In these times of hysteria, I wonder that no witches have been hung.” (Judge Anderson) 326\n\n::Wood’s supporters were filled with “hatreds and violence…turned against all manner of imaginary enemies”:: 33\n\nClaiming Ellis Island was a sinister indoctrination center 335\n\nAlbert Johnson’s decades long crusade against immigrants climaxes in the 1924 passage of the Johnson-Reed act, which placed the most severe restrictions on immigration in American history. It reduced by nearly 95% the number of unwanted immigrants, mostly Italians, Poles, and Jews. ::A young agitator in prison in Germany was so impressed by this law that he praised it in Mein Kampf, and sought to replicate it.:: The same law would bar untold numbers of refugees from the Holocaust, leaving them to end their lives in Hitler’s death camps.  351\n\nWhen a proposal was under discussion in 1939 that would have made an exception to the Johnson-Reed Act to allow 20,000 Jewish refugee children to enter the country, one of those who led the successful fight against it was Trevor, who declared that he wanted “to protect the youth of America from this foreign invasion.” A product of the darkest period of America’s twentieth century was precisely what stopped us from sheltering those trying to flee the nadir of the century in Europe. 352\n\nSocialism, of course, had never taken as deep root in the United States as it had in Europe, but for some years it was a significant force in American politics. The Republican and Democratic legislators who voted for early-twentieth-century reform measures like child labor laws and the income tax did so in part to stave off demands from the Socialist Party for bigger changes.\nIn 1911, for example, the Socialist congressman Victor Berger of Wisconsin introduced a bill for a national old-age pension, a goal that would be realized 24 years later as Social Security. In 1916, Socialist Meyer London of New York introduced a bill strikingly similar to one that would become law nearly a century later, the Affordable Care Act.\nHe also advocated freedom for the Philippines, unemployment insurance, and paid maternity leave. 353\n\nThe Socialist Party would never recover from the mass jailings and the crushing of its press that took place under Wilson. Had it not been so hobbled, even with a minority of voters, it might well have pushed the mainstream parties into creating the sort of stronger social safety net and national health insurance systems that people take for granted in Canada and Western Europe today. This is one of American history’s most tantalizing “what if?” questions. 354\n\nStark impunity bred more violence -\u003e the Tulsa massacre, kkk resurgence \n\nOn Memorial Day 1927, a march of some 1,000 Klansmen through the New York City borough of Queens turned into a brawl with the police. Several people wearing Klan hoods were arrested, one of them a young real estate developer named Fred Trump. Ninety years later, his son, with similar feelings about people of color, would enter the White House. 356\n\nThe appeal of simple solutions 357\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:04.982598129Z","tags":["nonfic","history"]},"/books/atlas-of-the-heart":{"title":"Atlas of the Heart","content":"\n- Worrying and anxiety go together, but worry is not an emotion; it is the thinking part of anxiety.\n- Avoidance will make you feel less vulnerable in the short run, but will never make you less afraid. \n- For anxiety and dread, the threat is in the future.

It’s an emotion that we often experience when we fail to set boundaries or ask for what we need, or when expectations let us down because they were based on things we can’t control, like what other people think, what they feel, or how they’re going to react.\n\n\u003e I think it’s important to point out, especially in this political and social climate, that when we feel relieved, grateful, or even happy that someone who has done something hurtful, unethical, or unjust is held accountable, that’s not schadenfreude and normally doesn’t stem from counter-empathy. On the contrary, it can stem from empathy for the aggrieved. It’s similar to the distinction that when we hold someone accountable and they respond to that accountability by feeling shame, it does not mean we’ve shamed them.\n\n\u003e SPOILER ALERT: I’m pretty sure this research explains why I do not like surprises. I’m not a fan of having to manage amplified emotion while in the spotlight. But it’s not just my introversion and the spotlight piece, I don’t like surprises in movies or TV series either. I know many of y’all will find this egregious, but I normally read the entire plot of any potentially stressful movie before I watch it. People assume that ruins it for me, but it doesn’t. I can actually enjoy it better without being thrown off the surprise bridge into amplified emotion. No, thank you.\n\n\u003e “Each person’s grief is as unique as their fingerprint. But what everyone has in common is that no matter how they grieve, they share a need for their grief to be witnessed.\n\u003e That doesn’t mean needing someone to try to lessen it or reframe it for them. The need is for someone to be fully present to the magnitude of their loss without trying to point out the silver lining.” (David Kessler)\n\n\u003e Re: compassion vs. empathy: It’s an important debate that is frustratingly hijacked on occasion by folks who come up with new, arbitrary definitions for emotions that are completely different from how we all use the terms. They change the meaning, then argue that the emotion is “bad” based on their new definitions. For example, someone might say that empathy is taking on all the feelings of another person, then argue that empathy is bad. Unfortunately, this approach is often misleading and self-serving and puts no value on how we use the word. I would argue that a lot of this linguistic shell-gaming is about wanting to be contrarian. There’s nothing more seductive and clickable than a discovery that something we believe to be good is bad: “Empathy is bad for you.” cf. [[Humankind: A Hopeful History]]\n\n\u003e Researcher Matthew Kuan Johnson explains that people find experiences of joy difficult to articulate. He hypothesizes that the very nature of joy pushes the boundaries of our ability to communicate about lived experience via spoken language. ==He also suggests that because language can shape lived experience, cultures that have more words to describe the emotion of joy may also experience joy more richly.==\n\n\u003e “Tranquil environments” provide many restorative elements that are needed to counter mental fatigue and attention depletion. Researchers Rachel and Stephen Kaplan found that there are four essential elements of a restorative environment: a sense of getting away, a feeling of immersion, holding attention without effort, and compatibility with one’s preferences.\n\n\u003e When we lose our tolerance for vulnerability, joy becomes foreboding. No emotion is more frightening than joy, because we believe if we allow ourselves to feel joy, we are inviting disaster. We start dress-rehearsing tragedy in the best moments of our lives in order to stop vulnerability from beating us to the punch. We are terrified of being blindsided by pain, so we practice tragedy and trauma. But there’s a huge cost.\n\n\u003e Anger is a catalyst. Holding on to it will make us exhausted and sick. It’s an emotion that we need to transform into something life-giving: courage, love, change, compassion, justice.\n\u003e Or sometimes anger can mask a far more difficult emotion like grief, regret, or shame, and we need to use it to dig into what we’re really feeling. Either way, anger is a powerful catalyst but a life-sucking companion.\n\n\u003e Humility is openness to new learning combined with a balanced and accurate assessment of our contributions, including our strengths, imperfections, and opportunities for growth.\n\u003e What humility isn’t: downplaying yourself or your accomplishments, which according to researchers is modesty, not humility. It’s also not low self-esteem or meekness or letting people walk all over you.\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:04.982598129Z","tags":["nonfic","emotions","therapy"]},"/books/band-sinister":{"title":"Band Sinister","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:04.982598129Z","tags":["romance","queer","historical","canon"]},"/books/basin-and-range":{"title":"Basin and Range","content":"\nFrom [Rhapsodist of Deep Time, Paul Zweig, the New York Times Archives](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/books/rhapsodist-of-deep-time.html):\n\n\u003e This stretching and folding of language, by which the geologist does to words what endless eons have done to his rocks, excites Mr. McPhee to language experiments of his own. In “Basin and Range,” he is not so much a visiting amateur as a rhapsodist of “[[notes/deep time|deep time]]” like Montaigne, who, centuries before James Hutton, celebrated the mind-stretching eons of change: “The world is but a perennial movement. All things in it are in constant motion—the earth, the rocks of the Caucasus, the pyramids of Egypt—both with the common motion and with their own. Stability itself is nothing but a more languid motion. I cannot keep my subject still. It goes along befuddled and staggering, with a natural drunkness.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Montaigne is a fitting companion for Mr. McPhee, who has the same sort of miscellaneous temperament, the same fascination with odd bits of knowledge. Whether Mr. McPhee writes about bark canoes, the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the Alaskan wilderness or now the “Big Picture” of America's geological history, he is offering us an oddly angled portrait of his own mind, an autobiography made up of shards and pieces, evoked in crisp adventurous prose. And the adventure finally is in the prose. In “Basin and Range” the perspectives and expertise of geology become a language for the drama of time.

Skewered by the marrow, every rider sheds some blood in the melting pot of the peloton's formidable heart, puts existence and breath at the service of the monster with a hundred mouths. Even when you consider those who ride apart from one another, the effort of a rider is never totally independent from the efforts of all the others.\n\u003e \n\u003e The hydra has the dimensions of the sea and the fluidity of water.\n\n---\n\n### On Armstrong, Froome, and the gratuitous fascination of doping\n\n\u003e Lance Armstrong, whose arrogance and cruelty I believe were unique.\n\n\u003e Froome is a stylistic heresy who contradicts my profession of faith of *kalos kagathos* or \"beauty is efficient,\" according to which style is the only thing that matters.\n\n\u003e But the fact that professional cyclists struggle to resist the temptations of those scary enhancing manipulations and even that they are often quite ready to use them is also what makes them fascinating. I find their incredible disdain for their own health moving. It pleads in favor of what they should be forgiven for. Basically, it is total innocence. ==Cyclists do not dope out of calculation or to make a career: those reasons only come afterward. They dope gratuitously, they do it because it is good.== Because to ride that fast is such a wonderful experience that it makes caution irrelevant. Such a great experience that you would give your life to go through it again. That is what I forgive them for and even what makes them so pure in my opinion. They are only looking for another taste of singular delights. Nothing was planned. After their first rides, they went from surprise to surprise. Whatever you may think of early vocations, none of these riders had any idea of what was awaiting them. You can dream of results, and work for them, but that is not yet living them.\n\n---\n\n### Pull quotes\n\n \u003e They ride around the area like butterflies around a lamp, briefly turned away from their course by an occasional burn.\n \n \u003e Cyclists see their bodies in a very peculiar way.

I’d add C. Thi Nguyen’s [[notes/playfulness vs epistemic traps|playfulness vs epistemic traps]] too. \n\nA concept I am utterly on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says vastly more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question. \n\nFor example: in trying to locate the so-called “agricultural revolution,” we look only for the traits we expect and overlook anything that doesn’t conform. We’re not looking for play, or seasonal variations of social structures, or the essential involvement of women, so that has been left out of the story. \n\nWe need to approach the evidence of the human past with fresh eyes. Read nonfiction as fiction. Are there not more interesting and important questions we could be asking?\n\n* Even Rousseau and Hobbes is like having a Garden of Eden, there was once some “original state” more natural than the rest \n* A false premise, a false binary—helpful once upon a time to shake out some older ideas, but now it’s getting us nowhere\n* “Inequality” is almost a fatalistic acceptance, some condition that can only be tweaked instead of ended (kings or governments can be overthrown, a vague notion cannot)\n* We imagine people in the past to be more dumb/“primitive” than we are\n* Europe got their form of government from China\n\n\u003e This is not, then, a book about the origins of inequality. But it aims to answer many of the same questions in a different way. There is no doubt that something has gone terribly wrong with the world. A very small percentage of its population do control the fates of almost everyone else, and they are doing it in an increasingly disastrous fashion. To understand how this situation came about, we should trace the problem back to what first made possible the emergence of kings, priests, overseers and judges. But we no longer have the luxury of assuming we already know in advance what the precise answers will turn out to be.\n\n* This different view of the past is basically [[Science fictional behavior]]\n* The myth of the agricultural revolution \n* Seasonal variations of social structure  (reminds me of seasonal gender in [[The Left Hand of Darkness]]\n* Also seasonal flooding with flood retreat farming (cf. [[notes/seasonal time|seasonal time]], [[notes/taoism|Taoism]])\n* schismogenesis\n* Many rebuttals to Yuval Harari (debunking Harari, Jared Diamond, as well as Rousseau)\n* When we tell these stories of losses of primordial innocence, women get written out of the picture (cf. [[notes/the carrier bag theory of fiction|The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction]])\n\n\u003e Instead of fixed fields, they exploited alluvial soils on the margins of lakes and springs, which shifted location from year to year. Instead of hewing wood, tilling fields and carrying water, they found ways of ‘persuading’ nature to do much of this labour for them. Theirs was not a science of domination and classification, but one of bending and coaxing, nurturing and cajoling, or even tricking the forces of nature, to increase the likelihood of securing a favourable outcome. Their ‘laboratory’ was the real world of plants and animals, whose innate tendencies they exploited through close observation and experimentation. This Neolithic mode of cultivation was, moreover, highly successful.\n\n* History’s first city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the environment, or on each other\n* I was keeping an eye out for Alfred Kroeber’s work (it’s there, first referenced on page 199, the 378!), but they do me one further and cite Le Guin herself, specifically ‘The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas’. \n\n## Rebuttals\n\nSome thoughtful pushback [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4614842121), among others.\n\nHowever, a lot of the negative reviews seem to want a new level of certainty, backed up by Facts™, and I can’t help but think that’s missing the point of the book.

One of the best books I’ve read about healing from abuse, dysfunction, and trauma. So much to relate to on every page (and not just because she had the same [Jimmy Eat World song ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-HPOHu8mY) as a lifeline in the early aughts).\n\nIt’s heartbreaking and eye-opening that her upbringing (Asian, middle-class, immigrant; raised in what she correctly calls the wreckage of America’s brutal proxy wars against communism) is almost a 1:1 overlap with what was going on behind the scenes for almost everyone I knew growing up (white, middle-class, evangelical; basically the inheritors of the “American dream”). \n\nThe punishment, dysfunction, shame, rejection, generational trauma, and often the outright abuse (sexual, physical, mental) that just got silenced and covered up. When kids need literally the exact opposite to survive: love, acceptance, safety, trust, respect. A voice. \n\n\u003e I am a product of a place. I am one of many. All of us are victims of a dysfunctional community that was very good at throttling itself while murmuring, “Smile through your tears. Swallow your pain.”\n\u003e \n\u003e It is within this normalcy, this transformation of a unique misery into the utterly banal, that I finally feel empowered. Maybe I can change my programming after all. Because the more common the disease, the more survivors there must be. A whole damn neighborhood can’t go down together in its entirety, can it? There have to be people who escape the stranglehold.\n\nIt’s so validating when the key things that help her heal are the same things I’ve discovered. Note: she does *not* break it down into 1-2-3 steps for healing; these are my own notes, a list I made when what worked for her has worked for me as well: \n\n- Self-regulation (calming your nervous system, creating an internal sense of safety)\n- Curiosity (instead of judging or shutting down emotions, befriend them and listen to them; learn who you are when no one else is around)\n- Compassion (every trigger has a purpose; learn to ask “what is this? What is this thing in my body right now? What are you trying to teach me?”)\n- Communication (complex trauma is fundamentally relational trauma—people who were supposed to be caring and trustworthy and safe were hurtful instead; practice healthy relationships)\n- Agency (you have power, you have choice, you have a voice)\n- Love (love, love, love, in abundance, for others, for yourself; the opposite of shame, blame, and fear is love)\n\nThere’s no single magic fix; there’s a mix of what works for each person at various points in their lives. But there is healing, and hope, and I love her definition of both:\n\n\u003e So this is healing, then, the opposite of the ambiguous dread: *fullness*. I am full of anger, pain, peace, love, of horrible shards and exquisite beauty, and the lifelong challenge will be to balance all of those things, while keeping them in the circle. Healing is never final. It is never perfection. But along with the losses are the triumphs.\n\n---\n\n### Pull quotes: \n\n\u003e *It’s okay to have some things you never get over.* In the span of half an hour, this man whom I had known for less than a season did what nobody in my life ever had: He took all of my sins and simply forgave them. He didn’t demand relentless improvement. There were no ultimatums. He asserted that I was enough, as is. The gravity of it stunned me into silence. Joey was the opposite of the dread.\n\n\u003e It made perfect sense to me later in life when I discovered that the Chinese word for endurance is simply the word *knife* on top of the word *heart*. You walk around with a knife in your heart. You do it with stoicism. This is the apex of being. \n\n\u003e My family tried to erase this history. But my body remembers. My work ethic. My fear of cockroaches. My hatred for the taste of dirt. These are not random attributes, a spin of the wheel. They were gifted to me with purpose, with necessity.\n\u003e \n\u003e I want to have words for what my bones know. I want to use those gifts when they serve me and understand and forgive them when they do not.\n\n\u003e The brain’s fear reflex is very real. But it has an opposite force, too, as ancient and as powerful. Our bodies and brains melt into kindness in the presence of one key ingredient. “This school made me feel like I was somewhere where people actually loved me.”\n\n\u003e But more and more, I am curious enough to ask the magic question: “What do you need?” These four words open doors and break down walls. With the benefit of understanding, we are no longer two separate beings floating through these threads alone. We are giving and receiving. Two reciprocal atoms hugging each other through the turmoil around us. *I hurt you. You hurt me. You’re mine.*\n\n\u003e PTSD is only a mental illness in times of peace.

Please realize that.” \n* “Pumpernickel,” traced back to its Germanic origins, means “fart goblin” \n* Worcester’s publishers steadfastly refused to bow to the vulgarity of cheap advertising, while the Merriam brothers went bonkers for it. “Get the best!” ads in 1849 proclaimed and never really stopped. \n* “She looked world-weary, like a circus clown two shows away from retirement, dolefully waiting for the inevitable pie right in the smacker.”\n* They’ll notice errors, but you can’t notice excellence in a dictionary because it consists of a lack of errors.\n\n---\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e “The fact is that many of the things that are presented to us as rules are really just the of-the-moment preferences of people who have had the opportunity to get their opinions published and whose opinions end up being reinforced and repeated down the ages as Truth.” p. 48\n\n\u003e The history of English is full of messiness and illogic because the English language is a true democracy, built entirely by the people who use and have used it, and people, generally speaking, are messy and illogical. p. 182\n\n\u003e Etymological fallacy is the worst sort of pedantry: a meaningless personal opinion trying to dress itself up as concern for preserving historical principles. It misses that language changes itself is a historical principle: a language that doesn’t change is a dead language, and as much as etymological fallacists seem to love the purity of Latin, you’ll notice that none of them have abandoned that whore English for it. p. 184\n\n\u003e I call it “craft” and not “art” for connotative reasons. “Art” conjures an image of the lexicographer as medium or conduit— a live wire that merely transmits something unkenned, alien. But “craft” implies care, repetitive work, apprenticeship, and practice. It is something within most people’s reach, but few people devote themselves to it long enough and with enough intensity to do it well. That sort of dedication to words comes across as batty, so we speak in metaphor. Defining is the mental equivalent of free throws in basketball: anyone can stand at the free-throw line and sink one occasionally; everyone gets lucky. But the pro is the person who stands at the free-throw line for hours, months, years, perfecting that one motion until it is as fail-safe as humanly possible, until it looks so much like second nature that an uncoordinated clod like me can watch them lob a rare miss at the net during a game and say, “Are you *kidding?* How easy is it to shoot a free throw?” p. 256\n\n\u003e Like everyone else, lexicographers need to move faster. This is, to be frank, nothing new: we have always felt the heavy thumb of business concerns whenever we define. And while defining gets easier with experience, and the easier it is to do something, the faster you can do it, there is a terminal velocity in lexicography. After a certain point, you simply can’t go any faster; to do so compromises the quality of what you’re doing. p. 259\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.014598278Z","tags":["language","nonfic"]},"/books/zealot":{"title":"Zealot","content":"\nThis book is good at: painting a more vivid picture of first century Palestine. \n\nAlso: introducing the conflict between Paul and the actual apostles (even if it does overreach a bit).\n\nBut ultimately way too many marks from my red pen where the info was wrong, and I’m not even a scholar, so I’m sure there are plenty more I missed.

B. Tylor.)\n\nFor self-identified animists, Graham Harvey explains, “the world and its various powers are neither good nor bad… but open, efficacious, and above all, relational.”\n\nTim Ingold: “We are dealing here not with a way of believing about the world, but with a condition of living in it.”\n\nFar from abolishing or preventing distinctions, then, this sort of animacy produces differences locally and interactively. Beings become the kind of beings they are in relation to the other beings who interact with them in a particular time and place.\n\nThe result of this dynamic, relational structure is not uniformity, all-is-oneness, or a “pudding of one identity,” but “a web of interdependencies.” (cf. [[holobionts]])\n\n---\n## The indigenous attribution of agency\n\nPer Mary-Jane Rubenstein in *[[books/pantheologies|Pantheologies]]*:\n\nEach creature is directly responsible for the well-being of many beings at many times, but not for all beings at all times, and these “overlap[ping] connections” sustain a community united not by its identity to itself, but by its complex, mobile, and interrelated differentiations.\n\nAs one might note, however, these distinctions (between the physical and the metaphysical, the this-worldly and the otherworldly, or the religious and the ethical) are rooted in the oppositions between spirit and matter, creator and created, that “animism” purportedly rejects.\n\nThe implication is that the indigenous attribution of agency and even personhood to vegetal life is not irrational, infantile, narcissistic, or delusional (which is to say, religious); to the contrary, these insights are so sophisticated that “plant science” has confirmed them.\n\nAnd it is precisely at this point that indigenous philosophies might congratulate earth-systems science for having finally caught up to what it has known all along; as Vine Deloria attests, “traditional Indians,” who have always asserted the animacy of the universe, “are quite amused to see this revival of the debate over whether the planet is alive.”","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.014598278Z","tags":["nature"]},"/notes/buddhist-concept-of-near-enemies":{"title":"The Buddhist concept of near enemies","content":"\nvia [[books/atlas of the heart|Atlas of the Heart]]: \n\nThe Buddhist concept of near enemies: “Near enemies are states that appear *similar* to the desired quality but actually undermine it. Far enemies are the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. For example, a near enemy of loving-kindness is sentimentality—similar but different. A far enemy of loving-kindness is ill will—the opposite of loving-kindness. Similarly, a near enemy of compassion is pity and a far enemy is cruelty.”\n\n\u003e The near enemies depict how spirituality can be misunderstood or misused to separate us from life. (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e I define spirituality as the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to each other by something greater than ourselves. I have friends who are atheists who every day practice inextricable connection—they hurt when others hurt and they know that none of us are free until all of us are free. I have friends who talk endlessly about their religion and wear scripture on their T-shirts, yet demonstrate no connection to anyone’s suffering but their own and maybe that of the people in their immediate circle. I make this point because we’re not talking about religion here. We’re talking about the irrepressible human spirit.\n\n\u003e On the surface, the near enemies of emotions or experiences might look and even feel like connection, but ultimately they drive us to be disconnected from ourselves and from each other. Without awareness, near enemies become the practices that fuel separation, rather than practices that reinforce the inextricable connection of all people.\n\n\u003e “The near enemy of love is attachment. Attachment masquerades as love. It says, “I will love this person (because I need something from them).” Or, “I’ll love you if you’ll love me back. I’ll love you, but only if you will be the way I want.” This isn’t the fullness of love. Instead there is attachment—there is clinging and fear. True love allows, honors, and appreciates; attachment grasps, demands, needs, and aims to possess.” (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e Near enemies can feel like manipulation and even gaslighting.

Queen Elizabeth proclaimed a set of laws designed to maintain order and contribute to the general good of the kingdom: **the English Poor Laws**.  These laws remained in force for more than 250 years with only minor changes. Essentially, the laws distinguished ==three major categories of dependents: the vagrant, the involuntary unemployed, and the helpless==. The laws also set forth ways and means for dealing with each category of dependents. Most important, the laws established the parish (i.e.,local government), acting through an overseer of the poor appointed by local officials, as the administrative unit for executing the law.\n\u003e\n\u003e The poor laws gave the local government the power to raise taxes as needed and use the funds to build and maintain almshouses; to provide indoor relief (i.e., cash or sustenance) for the aged, handicapped and other ==worthy poor==; and the tools and materials required to put the unemployed to work. Parents were required to support their children and grandchildren. ==Likewise, children were responsible for the care of their unemployable parents and grandparents.== Children whose parents could not support them were forced into mandatory apprenticeships. ==They had no right to object== to the compensation or the interference with their own child-rearing activities. Vagrants and ==any able bodied persons who refused to work== could be committed to a house of correction or fined.\n\u003e\n\u003e In response to concerns that dependent persons would move to parishes where financial assistance was more generous, ==in 1662 a severe **Law of Settlement and Removal** was enacted in England==. The law made it possible for local authorities to force individuals and families to leave a town and return to their home parish if they became dependent. In effect, this law allowed a local government to restrict aid only to persons and families known to be “residents.”\n\u003e\n\u003e==The American colonies and state governments== modeled their public assistance for the poor on the **Elizabethan Poor Laws and the Law of Settlement and Removal**.\n\nNote the sorting into categories, the “worthy poor,” the children with no right to object, the laws of increasing severity in order to close the loopholes.

And the American settlers of the time considered Indians and Hispanics to be inferior and therefore deserving of cultivation. The settlers considered the United States to be the best possible way to organize a country so they felt the need ==to remake the world in the image of their own country==.\n\nMany Americans believed that ==God blessed the growth of American nation== and even demanded of them to actively work on it. Since they were sure of ==their cultural and racial superiority==, they felt that their destiny was to spread their rule around and enlighten the nations that were not so lucky. The settlers firmly believed in ==the virtue of American people and the mission to impose their virtuous – mainly Puritan – way of life on everybody else==. This rhetorical background served to explain the acquisition of territories or reasons to go to war, such as the war with Mexico in 1840s.\n\nOutside the United States, the effects of manifest destiny were seen in U.S. intervention in the Spanish-American war when Spain ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico and Guam to the U.S. This was an expansion of U.S. territory as colonies rather than states and was ==another demonstration of growing U.S. imperialism==.\n\nThe term of ‘Manifest Destiny’ first appeared in a newspaper article on the annexation of Texas in edition from July/August of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review in 1845. The author, John L. O’Sullivan used it to describe what majority of Americans at the time believed was ==their mission from God: to expand to west and bring the United States government to unenlightened people==.\n\nSee also: [The Religious Origins of Manifest Destiny](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01gwbag7mpybwtjdb3ffnjhvnd\n)\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["history"]},"/notes/memes-and-social-movements":{"title":"Memes and social movements","content":"\n\u003e “Why do games like FarmVille and Pokémon Go periodically sweep social media?

Le Guin\n\n*Ed. note: just me copying and annotating this text in full, it’s that brilliant.*\n\n\u003e In the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable. Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein.== And we didn’t even work hard at it — much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else’s field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\u003e\n\u003eFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn’t have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. ==It wasn’t the meat that made the difference. It was the story.==\n\u003e \n\u003e It is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\u003e \n\u003eThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn’t their story. It’s his.\n\u003e \n\u003e When she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, Virginia Woolf wrote a heading in her notebook, “Glossary”; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. ==One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as “botulism.” And _hero_, in Woolf’s dictionary, is “bottle.” The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.==\n\u003e \n\u003e Not just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you haven’t got something to put it in, food will escape you — even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it’s cold and raining and wouldn’t it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn’t it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e *The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.*\n\u003e \n\u003e So says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women’s Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don’t know. I don’t even care. I’m not telling that story. ==We’ve heard it, we’ve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.==\n\u003e \n\u003e And yet old. Before — once you think about it, surely long before — the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger — for what’s the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can’t eat home in — with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\u003e \n\u003e This theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. ==(“What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman’s lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,” Lillian Smith observed.)== The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that’s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\u003e \n\u003e That’s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\u003e \n\u003e Go on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\u003e\n\u003e If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it’s useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again — if to do that is human, if that’s what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.\n\u003e \n\u003e Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don’t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It’s just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.\n\u003e\n\u003e It sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we’d better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one’s finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\u003e \n\u003e It’s unfamiliar, it doesn’t come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, “untold” was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\u003e \n\u003e ==The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story.== Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn’t any good if he isn’t in it.\n\u003e\n\u003e I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. ==A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.==\n\u003e \n\u003e One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but ==the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd.== (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, “A story should be seen as a battle,” and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\u003e\n\u003e Finally, it’s clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. ==You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.==\n\u003e\n\u003e That is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\u003e\n\u003e So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse’s skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don’t understand. ==I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn’t say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?==\n\u003e \n\u003e If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. “Technology,” or “modern science” (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the “hard” sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\u003e \n\u003e If, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time’s-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\u003e \n\u003e Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else ==in this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story.== In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool’s joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn’t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\nSource: https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["myths","canon"]},"/notes/the-curse-of-latin-y-grammar":{"title":"The curse of Latin-y grammar","content":"\nThe Latin-worshipping tradition is responsible for the grammar elitism of infinitive splitting, proposition ending, and the singular “they.”\n\nRobert Lowth, who wrote a widely used English grammar in 1792, passed an aesthetic judgment on the sentence-ending preposition (it wasn’t Latin-y enough), and later grammarians elevated this preference to a full-on ban.\n\nBy similar specious reasoning, they objected to infinitive splitting and the singular ‘they,’ despite centuries of prior English usage. \n\nThis is the same tradition responsible for adding a bunch of superfluous silent letters to words like “dete,” “samoun,” and “iland,” because “debt,” “salmon,” and “island” look more like Latin “debitum,” “salmonem,” and “insula.” (Never mind that “island” doesn’t even come from Latin, or that generations of schoolchildren would now have to go to extra effort.

But the internet has no beginning or end, and it’s growing faster than any one person can follow. \n\u003e \n\u003e Gretchen McCulloch, *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*\n\nSee also: [[notes/language is a network|language is a network]]","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["language"]},"/notes/theology-of-capitalism":{"title":"The theology of capitalism","content":"\n\u003e We have mostly forgotten to be surprised that a street preacher’s followers discovered, several hundred years after his death, how to be a regimented multinational corporate enterprise. *([[Pagans]], James O’Donnell)*\n\nIn *All About Love*, bell hooks (via Erich Fromm) says the principle underlying capitalistic society and the principle of love are incompatible. This poses an interesting dilemma for a religion that purports to be, indeed, all about love.\n\nUnfortunately, when that dilemma rears its head, we’ve seen the church support colonialism, industrial capitalism, greed, abuse and exploitation over the opposite. \n\nIn *Pantheologies*, Mary-Jane Rubenstein posits that the Protestant Reformation laid the groundwork for our mechanistic science—and vice versa. The Protestant iconoclasm and denial of transubstantiation drained spirit out of the material world, so it was perfecty poised to pair up with early capitalism, which had to exploit to survive.\n\n\u003e In other words, the recoding of animal, mineral, vegetable, and nonwhite human lives as machinery conditioned their unrestrained exploitation—an exploitation that would have been impossible without the rigorously anti-pantheological operations of imperial Christianity. *(Pantheologies)*\n\nI like the term imperial Christianity… basically Paul + everything after? This leads to a totalitarian theology, ironically professing to love all while only operating in service of [[notes/who is more deserving|those who are worthy]]. But lest we lay all the blame on the Protestants, Christianity long before then had become rooted in exploitation and violence: \n\n\u003e Hence, it was Christian for the Saxons to submit to “Holy Roman” imperial violence, to be crucified like Christ. The Carolingians constructed a Christian piety that used violence to convert pagans and then taught its victims to regard their violation as justified and sanctified.[^1]\n\nThis is the very same concept was perpetuated via [[notes/manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]. Once the colonies were settled, it became America’s founding myth. They had already inherited this legacy of violence, us vs. them, and either had to renounce their beliefs (so difficult!) or see themselves as superior and entitled to conquer this land. \n\n\u003e Puritan religious piety could not teach the equilibrium and equanimity needed to heal from horror, to relinquish fear, to forgive their enemies or themselves, and to repair harm. They lacked the spiritual disciplines that taught them to observe the world carefully, to trust the senses, and to wonder at the beauty of the land.[^2]\n\nThus the groundwork was laid, and all around us we see a blind, unquestioned belief in those principles. “Just because a myth is old doesn’t mean it’s healthy.”[^3] [[notes/tell different stories|What can our new myths be?]]\n\n[^1]: Rebecca Ann Parker and Rita Nakashima Brock, *Saving Paradise*\n[^2]: *ibid*\n[^3]: Sophie Strand, *The Flowering Wand*","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["belief systems"]},"/notes/untamed-episode-notes":{"title":"The Untamed episode notes 《陈情令》","content":"\nMy raw notes for *The Untamed*, started when I was trying to make sense of the plot but now an indispensable resource for fic.

Why does the existence of action carried out for the sheer pleasure of acting strike us as mysterious? What does it say about us that we  assume that it is?\n\nWe can’t reduce all living beings to rational, market actors. This tendency has been present since the 19th century beginnings of Darwinian science. Darwin, after all, borrowed the term “survival of the fittest” from the sociologist Herbert Spencer, that darling of robber barons–who was struck by how much the forces driving natural selection jibed with his own laissez-faire economic theories. \n\nCompetition over resources, rational calculation of advantage, and the gradual extinction of the weak were taken to be the prime directives of the universe. But why?\n\nAn alternative school of Darwinism emerged in Russia emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change. cf. [[books/mutual aid|Mutual Aid]] by Peter Kropotkin. It’s not just about cooperation as a means to an end though—Kropotkin posits that pleasure and play is an end in itself.\n\n## The origins of consciousness and free will \n\nFriedrich Schiller had already argued in 1795 that it was precisely in play that we find the origins of self-consciousness, and hence freedom, and hence morality.\n\nThis argument gets ignored, since cooperation for pleasure, as an end in itself, is difficult to recuperate for ideological purposes.\n\n## Is emergence enough?\n\n[[notes/emergence|Emergence]] is well and good, but is it enough to explain what’s going on? For example, if an electron is acting freely—if it, as Richard Feynman is supposed to have said, “does anything it likes”—it can only be acting freely as an end in itself. Which would mean that at the very foundations of physical reality, we encounter freedom for its own sake—which also means we encounter the most rudimentary form of play.\n\n## Play is not an anomaly\n\n\u003e What would happen if we proceeded from the reverse perspective and agreed to treat play not as some peculiar anomaly, but as our starting point, a principle already present not just in lobsters and indeed all living creatures, but also on every level where we find what physicists, chemists, and biologists refer to as “self-organizing systems”?\n\nThis gives us ground to unthink the world around us.\n\n## A famous Taoist story\n\nGraeber says when he taught at Yale, he would assign a reading of the following Taoist story, offering an automatic “A” to any student who could tell him why the last line made sense. (None ever succeeded.)\n\n\u003e Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on a bridge over the River Hao, when the former observed, “See how the minnows dart between the rocks! Such is the happiness of fishes.”\n\u003e “You not being a fish,” said Huizi, “how can you possibly know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “And you not being I,” said Zhuangzi, “how can you know that I don’t know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “If I, not being you, cannot know what you know,” replied Huizi, “does it not follow from that very fact that you, not being a fish, cannot know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “Let us go back,” said Zhuangzi, “to your original question. You asked me how I knew what makes fish happy. The very fact you asked shows that you knew I knew—as I did know, from my own feelings on this bridge.”\n\nThe anecdote is usually taken as a confrontation between two irreconcilable approaches to the world: the logician versus the mystic. But if that’s true, then why did Zhuangzi, who wrote it down, show himself to be defeated by his logician friend?\n\n\u003e After thinking about the story for years, it struck me that this was the entire point. By all accounts, Zhuangzi and Huizi were the best of friends. They liked to spend hours arguing like this. Surely, that was what Zhuangzi was really getting at. We can each understand what the other is feeling because, arguing about the fish, ==we are doing exactly what the fish are doing: having fun, doing something we do well for the sheer pleasure of doing it. Engaging in a form of play.== The very fact that you felt compelled to try to beat me in an argument, and were so happy to be able to do so, shows that the premise you were arguing must be false. Since if even philosophers are motivated primarily by such pleasures, by the exercise of their highest powers simply for the sake of doing so, then surely this is a principle that exists on every level of nature—which is why I could spontaneously identify it, too, in fish.\n\n## Stray notes\n\n- Debunks Richard Dawkins and The Selfish Gene, likewise Dennett\n- Jean-Paul Sartre at one point became erotically obsessed with lobsters after taking too much mescaline 🤣\n- Physicists are the poets of the scientific world (more playful and less hidebound creatures than, say, biologists— partly, no doubt, because they rarely have to contend with religious fundamentalists challenging the laws of physics)","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["play","pleasure","biology"]},"/notes/who-is-more-deserving":{"title":"Who is more deserving","content":"\n\u003e As if deserving meant anything.

Meadows cites the book *Health Communism*, tracing the deserving/non-deserving binary back to the early days of [[notes/english poor laws|English Poor Laws]], which had to source the “surplus population” (look at that language already) into increasingly marginal, verifiable categories.

Le Guin)\u003c/span\u003e\n\nLan Wangji knows a moment of scalding shock, as disorienting as a teacup suddenly spilled in his lap.\n\nIt’s happened more than once, this week. At least he is not alone with it this time. Lan Qiren is furious, unable to outfox the brash young cultivator standing in the middle of the class, who is giving eloquent, textbook answers to every question, answering so swiftly and humbly that it almost feels like a mockery, like he could yawn his way through it the way he has most of the morning, idly doodling and dozing, except for the fact that something interesting is finally happening and he’s going to enjoy the moment the way he would unwrap a sweet.\n\nLan Wangji is there for appearances. He is supposed to sit straight-backed and disciplined, the perfect model of a student, the shining pinnacle of everything the Lan have to offer. *He* is supposed to swiftly and humbly recite the correct answer when a student falters like an untutored novice. *He* is not supposed to feel his heart race, his fingers curling in his sleeves, outdone by a careless, lazy flirt who aims his smile at Lan Wangji as precisely as an arrow, treating scholarly, serious subjects like a practice game of swords. \n\n*Wei Wuxian.* The name is made for clenched teeth, for outbursts of frustration. He must have been old enough to be like… *this,* already, when he was given the name. \n\nLan Wangji feels scant satisfaction when Lan Qiren does have to call on him. Scanter satisfaction still when the room erupts in shouts like someone kicked a hive of bees. Lan Qiren throws his scroll. Wei Wuxian expertly ducks. By then it’s all just one long buzz in Lan Wangji’s head, *improper cultivation, redirection not suppression,* Lan Wangji already bowing when Lan Qiren orders him to the library to administer Wei Wuxian’s punishment. \n\nIt’s what he had asked for the first night, hauling Wei Wuxian in and tossing him down on the carpet in front of the two elder Lan. Punishment, principles, they were all in place for a reason. They were not to be scoffed at, eyes going wide as the moon at the sheer number of them, brushed off like dust shaken off his long sleeves. \n\nThey will be written, at length, in detail, line by line, by the thousands, until Wei Wuxian’s hand is so crabbed he cannot ink a brush, willpower so broken that he will only ever speak politely when spoken to, the fire of his spirit so quenched that the grin falls off his face. It’s this image Lan Wangji cherishes, mentally painting it brushstroke by brushstroke, rendering it in loving detail as he hauls Wei Wuxian from a waterfall and plants him in the library. \n\nIt can take all summer, if it needs to. \n\nWei Wuxian will *learn.* \n\n---- \n\nWei Wuxian does not learn. \n\nLan Wangji, diligent in all of his duties, reports on his progress to Xichen, and occasionally to their uncle himself, at the end of each week. Five copies transcribed. A dozen. A hundred. “One hundred and forty-three,” he says this evening. Strictly speaking, it is one hundred and forty-two and a half, because he crumpled up the final pages and told Wei Wuxian to do them over when he had inked most of the margins with stick figures kissing. But Lan Wangji is generous. He *will* make Wei Wuxian finish those pages; he will also finesse that number slightly to his brother for the sake of expedience.\n\n*Do not be needlessly pedantic,* principle one-eighty-five. \n\nIt is only his brother he reports to tonight, who looks over the pages Lan Wangji has brought him (sans stick figures kissing), and remarks, “His calligraphy is not improving.”\n\n“Mn,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nXichen suppresses a small smile. “Unlike his behavior in class. He has not caused a disruption in over a week. We have you to thank, Wangji.”\n\nLan Wangji purses his lips. They do. They have him to thank, because *now,* Wei Wuxian vibrates through class with all of his pent-up questions, unleashing the torrent on Lan Wangji as soon as they escape to the library, like a river flooding its banks. *Now,* Wei Wuxian directs a significant portion of his energy to the study and torment of Lan Wangji, fixating upon him like a particularly interesting specimen that he will pick apart with his fingers and consume piece by piece.\n\n*Do not be ungracious,* principle sixty-six. \n\n“—know it’s been a trial for you,” Xichen is saying. “You’ve done well, but I will have a word with Uncle. There is no reason one of the outer disciples cannot watch over him instead.”\n\nLan Wangji feels a pulse of alarm. An *outer disciple,* in Wei Wuxian’s hands. “No,” he says sharply.\n\n“No?” \n\nLan Wangji lowers his gaze in respect. It lands on the sheaf of pages Xichen holds, all the columns inked crookedly.[^1] “It would not…” He falters.\n\n“…be wise?” Xichen finishes. “Ah. I suppose not. You are right. Still, you have better things to do with your time. You are gracious, Wangji.” \n\nNo. No, he is not. He is… irresponsible, and incautious, and he doesn’t know why it feels like he told a lie when he did not. The vast pit of unease that sits in his stomach and has not dissipated in weeks roils away in confusion. He has *done nothing wrong,* and yet it feels like Lan Qiren could level his sternest gaze and dictate his harshest punishment, and Lan Wangji would deserve it. Wei Wuxian has *done everything wrong,* and he breezes through his days, beams with delight when he’s scolded, naps like a cat in the sunlight, without a trace of guilty conscience. \n\n*Do good, and goodness follows*—principle twenty-eight.\n\nSomething is profoundly disordered. Lan Wangji is still sorting out *what* when he walks home at dusk, taking the long way around to do some sitting by the waterfall. He is so lost in thought that he almost stumbles, halting abruptly when he spots someone there first. \n\nWei Wuxian is sprawled on the rock, deeply engrossed in a book. *Outside of class*—a book. Reading. Lan Wangji has to rearrange the mental disarray this causes, more things not in their right place. Probably, it is—no, he can’t think of something unkind to charge him with. A book is a book—always good.[^2] Exactly which text it is, Lan Wangji can’t see, only that it’s not one of their textbooks. He glimpses an illustration.\n\nHis feet move of their own accord, drawing him over. Wei Wuxian jumps a mile, dropping the book and then scrambling after it. He sits upright, suddenly exhibiting the perfect posture that he has heretofore lacked, placing the book in his lap, folding his arms over it, offering Lan Wangji his most virtuous grin.\n\n“Lan Zhan!” he says brightly.\n\nLan Wangji reaches down for the book.\n\nWei Wuxian, bright red, yelps and slaps him away. He quickly sticks the book under him, sitting on it, pulling his skirts taut over his knees. \n\n“Do not treat a book that way,” Lan Wangji says ferociously.\n\n“Ha! Can if I want to. It’s mine, Lan Zhan.”\n\n“Yours.” \n\n“*Mine,*” he repeats. He looks around them, shifting his attention placidly onto the view. “So pretty here, Lan Zhan. Do you ever swim in the water? Bet it’s freezing. Bet there’s a rule.” He makes a face, dropping his voice into what is probably meant to be an imitation of Lan Qiren. “*Swimming is prohibited in Cloud Recesses.*” \n\nWei Wuxian knows there is no such rule—he would have copied it a hundred and forty-three times if there was. But, Lan Wangji concedes—there is only no rule because such a rule has not been necessary. Gusu Lan disciples do not grow up swimming like fish.\n\n“I don’t swim,” Lan Wangji says.\n\nWei Wuxian looks up, aghast. “Don’t, or *can’t?* How can you not swim, Lan Zhan? Did you just never learn? In Yunmeng we learn to swim before we can walk. I would’ve drowned if I couldn’t, all the times Jiang Cheng’s thrown me in the river.”\n\nLan Wangji, in this instance, can commiserate with Jiang Wanyin. “What did you do to deserve it?”\n\n“Ha! Ha-ha-ha. Lan Zhan, you’re so funny. Something bad happened to me, so of course I deserved it.” He is shaking his head. “I’d throw *you* in a river, Lan Zhan. Just for fun.”\n\nIt has happened again. Lan Wangji has been drawn into a conversation he had no intention of having. He has also been neatly sidetracked from the book—which he did not care about in the first place. He does the mental equivalent of rubbing his forehead, right where the pain throbs in his temple. \n\nWei Wuxian tidies his skirts, tucking them around his ankles, looking for all the world like he won’t move for the rest of the night. It reminds Lan Wangji of his purpose, the sitting and meditating he would like to be doing. “Curfew,” he says.\n\n“Curfew?” Wei Wuxian echoes, looking up at the sky that is still light against the mountain.\n\n“You are breaking it.” \n\n“Not yet.” \n\nLan Wangji’s fingers clench reflexively around Bichen.\n\n“It’s not dark yet, Lan Zhan. Anyone can see it’s not dark. Curfew is nightfall.”\n\n“It will be nightfall,” Lan Wangji points out pedantically, mentally apologizing for rule one-eighty-five, “by the time you reach your rooms.” \n\nWei Wuxian sulks. Then he goes still, tipping his head like he’s sighting a bird in a bush.\n\n“Bribery is prohibited,” Lan Wangji preempts him.\n\n“No, no no,” Wei Wuxian says, lost in thought. “It’s just that—Lan Zhan. That would mean *you’re* breaking curfew.” He taps his nose thoughtfully. “Why would the beautiful Second Young Master Lan be risking his spotless reputation to sneak off after curfew? Lan Zhan!” His eyes widen. He affects a conspiratorial grin of delight. “Do you have a… secret lover?”\n\n“Wei *Ying.*”\n\n“I know, I know, I know, I know. Secret. Is she pretty, Lan Zhan? Or… he?” Wei Wuxian frowns thoughtfully. “I’m trying to picture you kissing someone, Lan Zhan. Who would make you like them *that way?”* He makes a face over the failure of imagination he is apparently experiencing. \n\nLan Wangji is just standing there, breathing sharply.\n\n“I can’t picture it. Lan Zhan is so pretty. Who would be good enough for him? They would have to be noble of bearing, and pleasing in virtue, and the most beautiful cultivator in the land…” He shakes his head woefully, then brightens. “Maybe they will come soon, and I will see for myself!”\n\nLan Wangji actually—*actually*—makes a guttural sound of frustration. He has not done that since childhood.\n\n“I know, I know,” Wei Wuxian says again. He tilts his head at Lan Wangji in pained sympathy. “You are worried I will tell on you since you told on me. But I am not that kind of person, Lan Zhan.” He is devious, utterly devious, because he makes his dark eyes look genuinely wide with distress. “Are you worried, Lan Zhan? Would they punish you, for love? Are you going to have to write Conduct and Virtue one thousand times?”\n\n“Wei Ying,” he says, with deadly calm. \n\n“Lan Zhan, do not worry. I, your faithful friend Wei Ying, will stand by you to the end.” He lifts three fingers to his brow, which he holds for a moment before he splutters and tries to be solemn, but can’t and breaks into laughter. “Lan Zhan, the look on your face. I should paint it. I’d need lots of red ink—Lan Zhan!”\n\nLan Wangji, with dignity, has turned to walk away. He keeps walking. Not caring. Let him break curfew. Let him break so many rules he has to do penance on his knees. Tie him down to a desk, see if he obeys then, hobble his ankles, put a silence spell on that mouth—\n\nAnother guttural sound, no one to hear but the trees.\n\n----\n\nLan Wangji does not like being toyed with. For a week he makes Wei Wuxian suffer through his impassive silence. He doesn’t glare, nor does he sulk, nor does he pointedly direct his righteous fury that way. He simply goes about his business as though Wei Wuxian does not exist, even during their afternoons in the library. \n\nIt is more effective than anything Lan Wangji has done all summer. Wei Wuxian suffers. He teases, he dawdles, he does everything he can think of that should earn him a scolding. Lan Wangji reads, unaffected, or transcribes his own perfect texts, paying attention only to the brush and his sleeves. Wei Wuxian acts like it’s agony, like no one has ever been so cruel to him as this. There is a lot of showy drama. After several days, he seems truly distressed, even apologizing in a roundabout way where he doesn’t directly admit fault, bringing Lan Wangji offerings, mostly fruit, which Lan Wangji doesn’t touch, letting it attract flies.\n\nIt is late afternoon, a gray day with rain pattering lightly on the roof, when the impasse finally ends. Wei Wuxian is attempting his own silent treatment, and is actually copying lines; Lan Wangji is deeply absorbed in a poem by Li Bai.[^3] There is a line of such beauty—*peach blossoms flow downstream*—that Lan Wangji looks up to absorb it, the way he would if he was alone in his room. His eyes land on Wei Wuxian as if they wanted to rest there in the first place, and Wei Wuxian, mid-brush stroke, lifts his gaze. \n\nThe moment snags the way a petal would, caught in the eddy of a stream. Wei Wuxian looks at him, and then slowly, like the first pink of dawn spreading across the pearly gray sky, he smiles. A quiet, soft smile of irrepressible loveliness, followed by a slow, happy blink that says, *thank you, and sorry.* That says, *ah, there you are, you finally see me again.*\n\n----\n\nIt is the white robe, through the trees, that pulls Lan Wangji off the path. He does not know how he knows it’s Wei Wuxian—he just does. It is not where it should be, for one; for another, there is talking. The words grow distinct as Lan Wangji draws closer—they’re such nice bees, he’s saying, nice bees who wouldn’t want to ever sting anybody, especially anybody like him, who’s so nice too, and their friend, and just wants to taste some of this delicious honey they’ve made, the most delicious in the world. \n\n“A-Xian!” \n\nA bright, girlish laugh stops Lan Wangji’s heart. There is someone else with him, a second robe fluttering, which had been just out of sight. She stands on the ground; Wei Wuxian teeters above her, atop a large boulder, up to his elbows in the hollow trunk of a tree. \n\n“Careful! Here, take it,” Wei Wuxian calls out, crouching to pass her something with both hands.[^4]\n\nHe is clouded in—bees. Everywhere, bees. The girl below him, undaunted by the swarm, shows no fear for him, or for herself. \n\n“Shijie!” he scolds her. “Don’t drop it,” and Lan Wangji recognizes the purple sash and ribbons of Wei Wuxian’s sister. \n\n“We shouldn’t be here,” she’s saying, which matches, with relief, the assessment Lan Wangji had made of her character: polite and conscientious, immune to mischief, soft-spoken and well-mannered, someone who could not be more unrelated to Wei Wuxian. \n\nExcept here she is, working in easy tandem, used to such things. Taking honeycombs from him, and placing them in a basket hanging over her arm. \n\n“I asked Lan Zhan,” Wei Wuxian is saying. “It’s fine. He said so. Shijie, how much do you want?”\n\nLan Wangji does not clear his throat, nor does he speak. He merely places himself in the middle of the clearing and waits for the thieving pair to notice. It is satisfying when they do. Jiang Yanli startles, by the base of the tree, quickly saying, “Second Young Master Lan,” and dropping into a bow around the basket.\n\nWei Wuxian has the decency to turn pink. \n\nHe is where Lan Wangji places his steady gaze, since he is no doubt the instigator. Jiang Yanli is saying something about how gracious Second Young Master Lan is, to understand their request and grant them this privilege. \n\n“Mn,” Lan Wangji says, inclining his head slightly, since going along with the blatant lie is making Wei Wuxian squirm. \n\n“See! Shijie,” he says, laughing nervously, recovering his footing, literally and figuratively. “I told you Lan Zhan was kind, and not boring at all, and not the type of person who would be mean and not share nice things with his friends.” He is pressing his luck, watching to see how far Lan Wangji will go with him as he plays out this rope. \n\nLan Wangji is curious about that himself. “Mn,” he says again. \n\nThere is more to the chorus from Jiang Yanli, how thankful she is, how the Lan clan is so hospitable, how already she feels better and wishes to know if—\n\n“A-Jie!” A shout interrupts them from the foot of the hill. \n\n“Ah, that’s a-Cheng,” she says, throwing a look at Wei Wuxian. She looks pained, torn between loyalty, politeness, and duty. Fortunately, for Lan Wangji, these obligations are in harmony. “I don’t wish to rush off, but he will… if you’ll excuse me,” she says. Demurely, she bows to Lan Wangji again, holding it an extra moment of courtesy. “A-Xian…” She trades a communicative glance with her brother, then skirts politely around Lan Wangji, a safe distance away before she calls out, “A-Cheng, I’m here! We found it,” picking her way through the trees. \n\nWei Wuxian, still on the boulder, waits for her to go before he spreads his arms, swoops down across the short distance, and lands face to face with Lan Wangji. A few bees fly with him, circling them both, until they find nothing of interest and desultorily return to the swarm in the tree. \n\n“Stealing,” Lan Wangji says, refusing to take a step backwards to keep proper distance between them.\n\n“Not stealing.” Wei Wuxian holds up two bare forearms, sleeves rolled up past his elbows. He shows Lan Wangji, front and back. A few scratches have raised faint little dotted ribbons of blood to the surface of his skin. No stings. “I asked nicely. The nice bees said yes. Didn’t hurt me. And it’s *their* honey, not yours.”\n\n“Lying.” Lan Wangji continues his list. \n\n“Only so shijie wouldn’t feel bad. And I *did* try to find you! Not my fault you hide from me all the time.” Another lie, and a glimmer of pleasure in telling it. Wei Wuxian’s eyes are warm brown at this distance, like rosewood polished to a gleam. \n\nLan Wangji holds his gaze. “Indecent attire.”\n\n“Fine, fine fine,” Wei Wuxian says, finally hearing a crime he’ll admit to. He flaps his arms in a shrug. “Bare skin! It’s so scandalous. Lan Zhan will maul me before we’re even out of the forest! My virtue will never recover.” He reaches to untie his sleeves and realizes his hands are sticky with honey, and tree bark, and a good deal of dirt. He shrugs again, dropping his arms sheepishly. \n\nLan Wangji makes a calculation. He turns and starts walking. \n\n“Lan Zhan—what the—” Wei Wuxian huffs. Lan Wangji does not look back. He knows the way through the trees; when he stops, Wei Wuxian has trailed after him warily, and stops too, a short distance away. \n\nLan Wangji waits for him to see it. When he does, his eyes widen a fraction, then narrow and stare at Lan Wangji askance. Begrudgingly, he crouches down to start scrubbing his hands in the trickling spring. \n\nIt is quiet a moment. They are away from the bees. The trees shift in the mild breeze; the water laughs on the rocks. \n\n“Shijie gets headaches,” Wei Wuxian says presently, his wrists red from the water, which pours from the rock cold and clear as ice. He is still scrubbing, not looking up. “Bad ones, sometimes. And fevers. It’s always worse when it’s rainy, like it has been.”\n\nIt is sudden, the change in his voice, stripped of all guile, leaving only sincerity. Lan Wangji says nothing, which Wei Wuxian interprets—as always—as a request to continue. \n\n“So bad sometimes that even the light hurts,” he says. “There’s not much that helps, but it was very bad the other day, so I went to Wen Qing for medicines.” He makes a face. “You should taste it, Lan Zhan. It’s the worst thing I’ve tasted, worse than your bitter tonic soup. At home we’d have wild honey, you know, to make bad things taste better. So I guess I talked about it a lot, which made us both homesick, which made shijie feel worse so I had to make her feel better. I told her, shijie, surely there is wild honey around. Your beloved brother Wei Ying will find it. And I did.”\n\nHe stands up, shaking his hands dry. Lan Wangji realizes with startling clarity that it is easy to tell when Wei Wuxian is telling the truth. He drops the lies, playful or otherwise, the way someone would lower a sword and leave themselves unguarded. \n\n“She would have been so embarrassed if you caught us,” Wei Wuxian continues. “If I hadn’t asked you permission. So thank you, Lan Zhan.” After a moment, he adds contritely, “I can write more lines if I need to.”\n\nThe woods are dappled with sunlight at this hour of the day. Wei Wuxian still has not rolled down his sleeves. His hands are brown from the sun, as are his arms, all the way up to his elbows—even though the skin is chapped now, red from the scrubbing. But there is no line where pale skin starts, the telltale sign of how often his sleeves are not where they should be.\n\nLan Wangji knows the trick of averting his gaze when his eyes speak too much. He employs it now, just like he had employed it a moment ago to avoid Wei Wuxian’s eyes when they were being honest and dangerous. “No,” he says. \n\n“No?”\n\n“More lines. There is no need.”\n\n“Oh,” says Wei Wuxian uncertainly, like bait he has dangled has been ignored by the fish. “Ah! Well, that’s good then.” \n\n“Mn,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nAfter a moment, he turns to walk away. Wei Wuxian falls in alongside him, stepping close as they pass through a narrow gap in the trees. He unrolls his sleeves, which fall around him and flutter like cabbage moths in the garden.[^5]\n\n“I guess it’s good then, back there, that I didn’t offer you honeycombs. I would have,” he says. “If it was just up to me. But I thought Lan Zhan would say, *bribery is prohibited.* Principle two-thirty-eight.”\n\nHe pauses to see if Lan Wangji will respond to this.\n\n“I’d have to copy a thousand more texts,” Wei Wuxian says faithfully. “Die of old age in the library. Hundreds of years from now, your Lan disciples would say what’s that in the corner? And you’d say, that’s Wei Ying, a pile of dust, because he gave Lan Wangji honeycombs…”\n\n“How do you not get stung?” Lan Wangji blurts abruptly. \n\n“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says, withdrawing the arm he had jovially bumped against Lan Wangji’s sleeve. “Oh, that? Bees are nice, like I said.” He waves it off. “If you’re calm, they’re calm too. Have you ever been stung? You might have made them mad, or scared them. That stern face of yours, Lan Zhan. That would do it. As long as they aren’t hurt or scared, they’re just happy little bees, buzzing around. I can show you—Lan Zhan.”\n\nWei Wuxian collides with him, this time because Lan Wangji has stopped in the middle of sun-dappled greenery. Wei Wuxian looks at him, miffed. \n\n“Butterbur,” Lan Wangji says.[^6]\n\n“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says. He is smart, so Lan Wangji waits for him to make the leap between the word and the leafy foliage at their feet. “Ah,” he says, when he does. “Butterbur. For… what?” \n\n“Headaches.”\n\nWei Wuxian looks at him a long time. “Oh,” he says finally, sounding lost, even though they are now only a stone’s throw from the path. He trails his gaze down again, looking around them, the sea of giant, cup-shaped, almost lotus-like leaves. \n\n“Dry the roots, or boil the leaves. Drink the tea,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nWei Wuxian scratches his elbow, looking supremely uncomfortable. “Thanks?” he says. “Lan Zhan? Can you please not do this again?”\n\nLan Wangji frowns. \n\n“It’s much more fun when I do something and you say, *ridiculous.* Or try to get me in trouble. I don’t know what to *do* with you when you’re like this, all—” He makes a helpless sound of distaste, gesturing up and down at Lan Wangji’s person. \n\nLan Wangji frowns longer, then turns to walk away. Wei Wuxian skips around him, circling in front of him, grabbing his arm. \n\n“See! That’s much better! Now get mad, say something mean, call me names—”\n\n“Let go,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nWei Wuxian drops his hand immediately. He steps backwards, which means he stumbles, and catches himself, and bumps against a tree. \n\n“Ow,” he says. \n\nLan Wangji traps him there, stepping closer. Wei Wuxian goes still, like a deer who knows instinctively it has been sighted as prey.\n\n“Lan Zhan,” he says, and laughs nervously. Just a soft, shaky *ha,* otherwise perfectly willing, Lan Wangji notices, to be pinned against a tree.[^7] He watches as Wei Wuxian swallows, the knot sliding up and down the line of his throat.\n\nIt’s too late. He’s too close. He has made a grave miscalculation. He cannot think past the soft shape of Wei Wuxian’s mouth. \n\nDesire splits him open, like an unpruned sapling too green to carry summer’s ripe fruit.[^8] He is trembling with want. He wants to—he doesn’t even *know enough* to know exactly all the things that he wants, a lack of knowledge that fills him with violent frustration. He wants to *kiss him.* Pale words for what he wants to do. He wants to maul him, bite him, lick him like the honey he hasn’t been given; bruise him like overripe fruit. He wants Wei Wuxian’s hands on him, grasping, Wei Wuxian *kissing him back.* He would need to pin his wrists then, grip his hips, do whatever it takes to wrest back control, hold on to some frayed scrap of his dignity even as the kiss grows longer, and—and gentler, and deeper, and—\n\nScalded, Lan Wangji takes a step back. Wei Wuxian sways forward, like they’re tethered, reaching after him without thinking before they both freeze in unison, one step apart, staring. Wei Wuxian looks addled, like the surface of a pond where someone has just chucked in a stone.\n\nLan Wangji desperately wants to hear footsteps coming up the path. Something that will pull them apart; a flock of encroaching disciples, even ones who whisper *jade princess,* cast sly looks at Wei Wuxian and stifle giggles in class.\n\nNothing happens. No rescue comes. Lan Wangji blinks; Wei Wuxian frowns. He blinks again, giving his head a brief shake to clear it. “Wei Ying,” he says. His gaze is resting on the folds of blue and white cloth at the base of his throat. \n\nSomething moves. Wei Wuxian looks down. Carefully, haltingly, he parts the top layers of his robe. The little yellow bee, hidden there, flicks her wings, scrubs her legs. Wei Wuxian lifts her out, coaxing her onto the tip of his finger.[^9] The bee perches there for a moment, Wei Wuxian’s eyes going wide and delighted, almost crossing over each other in order to peer at her more closely. Another elegant flick of her wings, she takes flight, looping over their heads, finally zagging sharply off towards the nearest patch of blossoms.\n\nWei Wuxian’s laughter is soft and carefree, eyes shining, no longer the least bit off balance. He grins at Lan Wangji and recites, “Never hurt insects or plants,” the eleventh Lan principle. \n\n“I—” Lan Wangji says, and fights back the words. \n\n“Me too,” Wei Wuxian says, which shows he has no idea what Lan Wangji was going to say. Lan Wangji doesn’t know either, except it wasn’t anything that would have Wei Wuxian saying, “Shijie will think I’ve gotten lost in the woods,” and tucking his robes tight together, skipping the short distance down to the path that winds its way down the mountain. \n\nThen he darts back up, sheepishly grinning as he plucks a few stalks of butterbur, wriggling them loose from the earth so the plugs of roots come up with them. \n\n“Coming, Lan Zhan?” he calls from below, once he is back on the path. \n\nLan Wangji shakes his head brusquely. Wei Wuxian tosses him a wave and that bright, undaunted smile, and whistles a little as he wanders away.\n\n----\n\nIn the cold springs, Lan Wangji doesn’t remove his robes. He sits with the water up to his shoulders, his submerged posture impeccable. His fingers have gone numb by the time they shrivel into prunes. \n\n“Wangji.” A polite cough. “Wangji? …Wangji.”\n\nLan Wangji looks up and blinks. He is not sure how long his brother has been sitting there, bare-shouldered, the tail of his ribbons floating in the water. It seems like maybe a while. He looks amused. \n\n“I said, your lips are blue,” Xichen says gently. \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, rising, reaching for his robe to pull around him—which he is already wearing. He climbs out of the pool, trailing water. It follows him up the path, along with the sound that is either Xichen’s soft laughter or the wind in the trees. \n\n----\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, to everything.\n\nIt becomes the pattern of his days. No to Wei Wuxian, who bounces up alongside him with schemes or smiles, or loquats, or warmth he pours out like cups of Lan Wangji’s favorite tea. No to Xichen (who has acquired the untimely habit of saying *yes*). No to company, while hunting water ghosts. No to absurd, clever theories. No to the half dozen flirtations he has to fend off before noon. No so exhaustively, so reflexively, so nonsensically, that Wei Wuxian makes it a game, counting it as a victory when he can get Lan Wangji to say anything else.\n\nLan Wangji *would* say something else if he knew what to do; if he knew how else to survive this. \n\nHe reaches the ends of his days sweaty with exhaustion. There is no one he can turn to. Uncle—his mind balks. The last place to breathe any words that could connect back to Wei Wuxian is in Lan Qiren’s presence. Xichen is no longer a refuge. Even if Lan Wangji were to present his dilemma in hypothetical form, all identifying details removed, Xichen would just smile indulgently, nod sagely, and murmur unhelpful encouragement about cultivating friendships. Lan Wangji loves his brother, but—*honestly.* \n\nEven books fail him. The poets have two poles on the subject: infatuation, and heartbreak. The books of wisdom offer the same word Lan Wangji already has: *no,* but with nothing else helpful like *how.* Any texts with illustrations give him heart palpitations. He approaches blue covers now the way he would approach a snake in the grass. \n\nIronically, miserably, it’s in Wei Wuxian’s presence where he feels like he would have a confidant. Wei Wuxian is undaunted by anything. He would put his clever mind to it, and be kind like with his sister—no. Not on this matter. On this matter he would crow with delight and—probably climb in Lan Wangji’s lap, exhibit *no restraint*—\n\nLan Wangji is sweaty again. He devotes every spare minute to more cultivation. Even Xichen grows concerned, tells him—*lies to him*—that it’s not a crime nor a sin to enjoy himself. A boy his age, he’s allowed to not be so strict on himself all the time. Pleasure, fun—these are words Xichen uses, a foreign language that Lan Wangji is suddenly expected to know. \n\nMore expectations placed on him. He is aware that even the most sturdy bow snaps under ill-applied pressure, strung with too tight a string. \n\nHe is not a bow, though. Nor a boy. He is—he is *Lan.* \n\nAnd he is lost. \n\n---- \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, when there’s liquor. \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, when he’s drunk. \n\n“No,” he says wildly, panicked, when Wei Wuxian—also drunk—is just going to crawl in bed beside him, yawning. \n\n“No,” he says, more painfully, softly, when Wei Wuxian tries to leave. \n\n“Lan Zhan, I have never known anybody more ridiculous than you are,” Wei Wuxian grumbles, but then does what he always does, finds the space between those two *no’s* and folds himself back down to sit on the floor by the bed.\n\nHe unties his sash, his outer robe. He flings the sash away in the same motion that Lan Wangji bolts upright. \n\n“Lan Zhan! *Calm down.*” Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes. “You can have one or the other. You can have the bed, or you can have me fully dressed. Can’t have both.”\n\nHe takes a swig from the jar, missing half of it with his mouth, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, which distracts Lan Wangji temporarily from the discarded sash. Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes again, placing both hands on Lan Wangji’s shoulders to ease him back down on the bed. \n\n“See? More comfortable. Yes?” Wei Wuxian says in the patient way people speak to small children. He perches his chin on his hand, observing Lan Wangji for a moment. “Are you going to sleep now? Or call me Wei-gege again?”\n\nLan Wangji’s ears blaze with heat. He can keep the color off his face if he stares up at the ceiling.\n\n“Hmm,” Wei Wuxian muses. “Not harsh, but refreshing. Soft, yet full bodied. Mature and fragrant.” His eyes widen, happy to put on a display of innocence when Lan Wangji turns to look at him. “Describing the liquor, Lan Zhan. You’re supposed to do that when you drink. All the poets do it.”\n\nLan Wangji’s description would be *vile.* He keeps that thought to himself, returning to stare unblinking at the ceiling. He can sense instead of see the face Wei Wuxian makes—his *Lan Zhan is so boring* face, a fact they’ve well established—but he is silent for a moment, which gives Lan Wangji’s question the chance to come tumbling out. “What else does one do when one drinks?”\n\n*Fun,* Xichen’s word, the language he is supposed to be learning. One might as well ask an expert. \n\n“Well,” Wei Wuxian says, taking it seriously. “Dumb stuff. Laugh a lot—things are funnier when you’re drunk. One time Jiang Cheng dared me to steal a boat, and I did, but it leaked, and we sank.” He grins to himself, basking in the memory, then shrugs with one shoulder. “You just play around. Do what you want. Tease the boy you like.”\n\nLan Wangji cuts his eyes at him. \n\n“Kiss the boy you like.” Wei Wuxian takes a small sip of liquor. \n\nLan Wangji feels the same jolt as when he walked in the room, the sudden little violent reaction at finding Wei Wuxian piled beneath the boys on the bed. Is this what he does when he drinks? Lose all inhibitions, let *someone else*—\n\n“Lan Zhan?” Wei Wuxian says, amused. \n\nThe silence has gone on too long. It is telling, because Wei Wuxian has set aside the jar and folded his arms on the bed, regarding Lan Wangji with interest. \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says. \n\nThe familiar response makes a smile bloom on Wei Wuxian’s face, warm and just as familiar.\n\n“Okay. Lan Zhan? Because you could,” he says patiently. “Kiss me, I mean. Just as friends. I wouldn’t mind. I would—”\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says. It doesn’t sound like his voice. \n\nWei Wuxian scoots up a little, propping up on his elbows. Lan Wangji, taken leave of all of his senses, responds without thinking, raising up on one arm to meet him. \n\nWei Wuxian looks into his eyes. That lasts for several long moments. Then he is frowning, saying, “Just a little…” and tipping Lan Wangji’s head for him. Lan Wangji has already done something wrong, not known how to fit—with their noses. Even drunk, he is lost, all the way outside the bounds of his meagre experience, unable to know what any sensible person would know how to do—\n\nThe kiss happens then. Neatly, chastely. Lips are pressed against his. It is—dry, a little strange. Lan Wangji feels detached, unsure if he’s missed an important instruction. There is no precedent for it. *This is kissing,* occurs in the back of his mind. \n\nWei Wuxian opens his eyes, pulling back. He looks—not *disappointed,* but doubtful. Lan Wangji has doubts too. He also has vast experience of the look on Wei Wuxian’s face when he sets his formidable mind against an unforeseen complication. Lan Wangji meets him partway that time, when Wei Wuxian leans back in. \n\nBetter. Still chaste, still dry lips against lips, but Wei Wuxian has softened his mouth. Lan Wangji does the same, never one to let someone outmatch him. A string of soft kisses then, two, three, four, each one polite and studious. Lan Wangji makes a sound of dissatisfaction. \n\nWei Wuxian shuffles up closer. He licks his lips, places his hand boldly on Lan Wangji’s chest, leans in and delivers what the kiss has been missing. \n\nThis time it—*oh.* Lan Wangji’s lips part. He lifts up, chasing the kiss, a change of angle, and pressure—their lips slot together. It is wet now, and warm—an impossibly soft, silky heat that snags on his lips and spills down through him the way the liquor had done. *Kissing,* it’s—a little breathless, like drowning, or flying. Wei Wuxian climbs up closer; Lan Wangji’s hand slides around the nape of his neck. They both make a small sound at that, startled. The kiss grows more clumsy, more pressing, Wei Wuxian the one learning places his hands can go. \n\nIt’s—they pull apart. They pant a little, hands stuck in each others’ hair. \n\n“I didn’t—!” Wei Wuxian protests, letting him go with an alacrity that makes Lan Wangji’s heart give a hard painful kick, until he realizes Wei Wuxian is staring at his ribbon, askew across his forehead.\n\n“Ridiculous,” Lan Wangji says hoarsely, and pulls him back in.\n\nThe kiss changes that time, again. Wei Wuxian is almost in his arms, and it makes awareness slide through them, of what exactly they’re doing. The kiss deepens, and slips, and then—Lan Wangji doesn’t even know quite how it happens. They’re still kissing—his hand on Wei Wuxian’s chest—but each kiss recedes, one by one. Like the tide going out. Safer kisses, softer kisses, circling around and arriving back at the polite, uncertain beginning. Lan Wangji lets him go, his hands empty when the last kiss breaks apart. \n\n“Ah,” Wei Wuxian says, and clears his throat. “Lan Zhan, that was…” He smiles a little, and rallies. “That wasn’t bad. That was good.” He pats Lan Wangji’s chest, job well done, and musters a different smile for him, cheerful and obliging. He looks mussed and—well-kissed, and unspeakably lovely, silver hairpiece askew, outer robe slipping down off his shoulder, his lower lip red where Lan Wangji bit and tugged it at the end. \n\n“Ah, you can—you can forget all about this in the morning,” Wei Wuxian says reassuringly, patting his chest again. “Never happened. I mean, I’ll probably remember a little, just because it was… and you’re…” Lan Wangji dies a little when he doesn’t finish that sentence. “But I wouldn’t ever—just two friends, drinking. Wouldn’t ever make you lose face. Promise, Lan Zhan. We don’t ever have to talk about it again.”\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says, but the sound doesn’t quite come out. Wei Wuxian slips away, off the mattress, bedding himself down on the floor. His head appears again, too abruptly. \n\n“*Aren’t* we friends now?” \n\nLan Wangji, who is flat on his back again, staring fixedly at the ceiling, shakes his head. \n\nWei Wuxian sighs. “Think we *are,*” he mumbles under his breath. “Gave you my bed. Got you drunk. Had fun. Talked.” He sounds like he is counting on his fingers as he rattles this off, perversely leaving off *kissed.* “I do so much for you, Lan Zhan, and you don’t even say, ‘Wei Ying, here, you’re so generous, you should have half of the bed, which is yours in the first place, I would not be so rude—’”\n\n“No.” Lan Wangji finally manages to get the word out. \n\n“*Fine.*” Wei Wuxian grunts, sounding suspiciously like he is grinning all over. There is too much noise as he shuffles around, fumbling and settling and trying to get comfortable.\nAnd then there is too much quiet. \n\nHis head pops up again. “Hey, Lan Zhan, I have books! Sometimes I read, when I can’t sleep—”\n\n“*No,*” Lan Wangji says, so forcefully that there is no doubt this time about Wei Wuxian’s grin. He beams at him, draping his arm across the foot of the bed, the position in which he has apparently decided to sleep. \n\n“Whatever,” he says blithely, poking Lan Wangji’s ankle before he closes his eyes. “Just don’t complain at me in the morning, when you haven’t slept and have a headache so bad you can’t open your eyes, because you didn’t take my advice, and then everybody says, what’s wrong with Lan Zhan, usually he’s so mean but now he just looks adorable, I feel sorry for him, I think he must actually be a very nice person…”\n\n----\n\nIt’s almost alarming, in hindsight, how little anything changes. \n\nLan Wangji wakes up the next morning—Wei Wuxian doubled over laughing, trying to shake him awake, pull him up off the *floor*—mortification scalding the entire surface of Lan Wangji’s skin—but none of it forces a reckoning, nor a major point of departure, nor a fork in the road from which he is unable to return.\n\nAll of that happened weeks ago—*months.* That’s the truth that dawns on him through the course of the day. He has already discovered so much new terrain in himself that he just… feels like himself. A little bitchy, a little terrified; miserable with longing and unrepentant and still utterly lost as to what he will do. \n\nWei Wuxian doesn’t go anywhere. He squawks in protest at their punishment; he chases Lan Wangji through the cold springs. He is just like himself too, infuriating and loyal and—oddly quiet, robes dripping, watching Lan Wangji tie his ribbon around their wrists. \n\n*That* should feel strange, at least. New. A fundamental shift between them; instead, it feels like it has for the last half of the year, a fate that has stuck them together, half-wedded, half-doomed. \n\nNone of it can last. This Lan Wangji knows. There is no future for them with Wei Wuxian happily ensconced at his side. He does not belong here, with three thousand rules and bitter soup served at mealtimes and the sour-faced, severe Second Jade who takes it as courtesy when his personality is described as merely aloof. \n\nThis boy who calls his sword *Whatever.* This young man of grace, mischief, and beauty, too wild-hearted for the Gusu Lan to contain.\n\nLan Wangji knows all of this, and still it slides into his heart like a blade, Wei Wuxian painting lanterns, pledging words about duty and justice, wishing to have a clear conscience all the days of his life. \n\nAnd that—*that* feels like a turning point. A thousand tiny fires trapped inside him,[^10] lifting up like the lanterns away from the mountain, into the sky.\n\n\n[^1]: My first departure from TV canon, since it shows perfectly inked pages when WWX wakes up under his homework (ep 3).

Trapped in a cave. At the time, it doesn’t feel like those seven days could determine the course of his life, or Wei Wuxian’s. \n\nAnd yet. \n\n---- \n\nLan Wangji wakes up to the sound of exertion. \n\nIt has scarcely been a day; already he has learned that any sound in the cave is less alarming than silence. His leg keeps finding new ways to ache, which means he’s kept trying new ways to slip past the pain—dozing, mostly, outside of his habitual sleeping hours, or meditation so deep it might as well be unconsciousness. Wei Wuxian scolds him, saying how are they supposed to count the days if Lan Wangji sleeps at all hours, *so undisciplined, really,* and still it’s easy to slip in and out of consciousness, his body overtaxed and more broken than it has been in a while. \n\nThat is one thing he’s woken up to, the scolding. There was also the snapping of twigs, Wei Wuxian yelping when he pinched a finger while feeding the fire. There was what first felt like silence—but turned out to be the faint sound of water, Wei Wuxian coming up out of the pool to bring back a new layer of robes that he would have to spread out and dry. \n\nThe actual silence, in which Lan Wangji basked for a single, decadent moment before he opened his eyes, had been Wei Wuxian an inch from his face, feathering a maple leaf over Lan Wangji’s skin. Wei Wuxian yelled and fell backwards, and then scolded Lan Wangji for so long that, eventually, the scolding helped calm the way Lan Wangji’s heart was trying to pound out of his chest.\n\nSo, the sound of exertion: a welcome thing. It gives Lan Wangji time to greet the pain in his leg, and to gather himself for the sight that awaits him. \n\nWei Wuxian, on the other side of the fire, carefully moves through sword drills, testing his injured shoulder. \n\nHe’s wearing the red inner robe, half-dry and streaked with the same dirt and soot that streaks his hands and his face. The sword, salvaged from a fallen Wen soldier, has no spiritual power behind it; it’s different from the way he wields Suibian with effortless grace. But he is still—Lan Wangji has the strength to admit this—an exceptionally skilled swordsman, an elegance and intensity to his movements that is arresting to watch. There is a kind of grace, Lan Wangji thinks, that is no less striking for the effort. Wei Wuxian wipes the hair out of his eyes and goes through the same drills again, and again, finally sheathing the sword with a grin of boundless delight when he catches Lan Wangji watching him. \n\n“You’re awake!” he says, dropping down beside Lan Wangji to poke at the fire. “I’m getting better. My shoulder.” He exhibits this range of motion, then rubs at his chest, wincing slightly. “Not that it really hurts but it’s good to keep stretching it out, make sure it heals properly. Shijie would make me eat lots of protein if I was at home, so my stomach keeps growling. Have you ever had lung fung soup? No, I guess not. It’s a Yunmeng dish. Or pork rib and lotus root? Nobody makes it like shijie. I’d get injured just to have it, it’s that good.” He rubs his stomach with a look of distress and longing. “I don’t know what’s worse, to think about food or to not think about it. How’s your leg, with the medicine? I’ll be ready to fight Xuanwu like we planned when you’re ready.”\n\nLan Wangji has followed this stream of talk the way he follows most things out of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, with effort and partial success. “Mn,” he answers, to the one question he deems relevant.\n\n“Good,” Wei Wuxian says sincerely. “It’s from Wen Qing, so I knew it would help. You’ll feel better, Lan Zhan, and then we’ll fight Xuanwu, and if I die you have to tell everyone how brave I was.” \n\nHe’s teasing. He flashes a smile so brilliant and full of life it says *how could I ever die?*\n\nLan Wangji, knowing better than to argue, says, “Mn.”\n\n“I want at least three songs written about me,” Wei Wuxian requests. “Make sure they mention my beauty, not just how strong and fearless I am. You don’t have to lie about it—I’m modest too. Just say I was half as beautiful as the Second Jade of Lan, that makes me twice as beautiful as anyone else.”\n\nLan Wangji, through much experience, knows a ploy when he sees one. He is being provoked, into a scowl or a scoff or—Wei Wuxian probably hopes—the elusive eye roll. He refuses to rise to the bait. \n\n“That’s why you can’t die first,” Wei Wuxian is saying. “I’m good at music, but you’re better. Okay?”\n\n“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says, since the edge of his robe is dangling in the fire he’s just stoked. \n\n“Oh,” Wei Wuxian says, patting out the stray sparks, tucking the robe safely beneath him. He doesn’t say thanks, but he nods, and then he bends down to check on Lan Wangji’s leg in the newly bright light. \n\n---- \n\nLan Wangji is learning this about himself: he has had enough of caves for a lifetime. \n\nWei Wuxian, for all of his self-professed boredom, appears to share none of this sentiment. He explores the cave with enthusiasm, wandering off and returning to their circle of light, faithfully reporting each finding in exhaustive detail, at length, often already mid-sentence by the time he returns to Lan Wangji by the fire.\n\nThere is a shallow pool in this chamber. There are no signs of fish; there might be snakes, he’ll keep looking. There are definitely bats, which means the pool is not safe to drink—a fact he dwells on less than he does the squeaks and flaps of the little bats, so *cute,* Lan Zhan. \n\nThere is plenty of firewood. There is no sign of an exit. The bodies are gone, which makes Lan Wangji’s eyes widen, even as Wei Wuxian decides this bodes well for them. If Xuanwu stuffs himself, he won’t need them as a meal. “I bet he’s just hungry, Lan Zhan. *You’d* be pissed off too if you’d gone hundreds of years without a good snack.” It’s only the second day of their fast, but this is close enough to the truth that Lan Wangji can’t dismiss it. \n\nThis bodes well too: there *is* water. The Wen soldiers dropped flasks as they fled or fell, and Wei Wuxian gathers an armful, enough to last three or four days, more if they ration it strictly. There is medicine too—Wei Wuxian shakes him awake over that one, an incoherent story about a bottle that he’d lost and thought was gone but then finally found. Bleary, Lan Wangji accepts the two pills Wei Wuxian drops on his tongue, dutifully coughing them down with a sip of stale water. Wei Wuxian brushes his chin, then swallows one pill for himself. \n\n“—our cores,” Wei Wuxian is saying, something about the nourishment thereof. It’s not food, nor is it enough to fully quench the pain or the thirst, but after a while, Lan Wangji feels as if he could keep his eyes open for more than an hour at a time. The pain recedes slightly. It feels like pale spring sunlight inside him; not a surge of energy, but a glimmer—a hope.\n\n“Knew Wen Qing could help us,” Wei Wuxian says happily, and performs another small miracle: for the first time in days, he closes his eyes and his mouth, allowing them both a few moments of rest. \n\n---- \n\n“Have you ever broken a bone? Before this time, I mean.”\n\nLater that day, or the next. Time bleeds like the wound on Lan Wangji’s leg before it had clotted. Wei Wuxian claims to keep track, but then again he has claimed it would take only two days for rescue, forgetting their rescuers have no swords to maneuver. Or maybe he does remember, but won’t say anything, chastened from when he’d already stumbled over the fact that help won’t be forthcoming from Cloud Recesses. Perhaps they are both politely keeping up fictions. Lan Wangji, trying to discipline his mind away from worst-case scenarios, has found that to his dismay the constant chatter helps. \n\n“Mn,” he says, which Wei Wuxian interprets correctly as *no.*\n\n“Really? Not ever?” He is lying on his back, one arm folded beneath his head, idly twirling a stick through his fingertips. “I have, lots. It’s not so bad, once you get used to it.”\n\nLan Wangji cannot conceive of *getting used to* the kind of pain in his leg. He bears it, he ignores it when necessary, but the pain touches a deep core of anger inside of him, something that cannot stand to suffer injustice. \n\n“I climbed lots of trees,” Wei Wuxian is explaining. “I’d sleep up there, then fall and break my arm. Once it was because Jiang Cheng threw me off a pier.”\n\nLan Wangji tries to conceive of that too, a brother who shows his affection with aggression. Picturing Xichen throwing him off a pier, he might as well picture Xichen cutting off his head. \n\n“I’ve gotten burned before too.” Wei Wuxian starts to hike up his skirt, then thinks better of it, dropping the fabric back down over, presumably, whatever scar lurks beneath. “I was old enough to know better, but shijie’s soup smelled so good, I tried to climb up to reach it and knocked the pot off the stove.”\n\n*Old enough to know better should apply to everything that you do,* Lan Wangji refrains from saying. See, he can do politeness, and fictions. \n\n“Once,” he says, and then pauses.\n\nWei Wuxian, sometimes, knows when to wait out the pauses. He twirls the stick through a complicated series of loops, both of them watching his fingers. \n\n“Once,” Lan Wangji says again. “I slipped. With Bichen. I had only just begun training. It took weeks to heal.”\n\n“Ooh, Lan Zhan.” Wei Wuxian flips over to face him, eyes bright with interest. “You do have scars.”\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says illogically. \n\n“No? It didn’t scar? Do you have secret medicines known only to the Lan?”\n\nWhat Lan Wangji had meant was, *no, I won’t show you,* only to realize he hadn’t been asked. He blushes in the firelight that is too dim to show blushes.\n\n“No,” he says again. \n\n“No secret medicines? Oh.” Wei Wuxian looks disappointed. Then he brightens. “That means you *do* have scars, though. You’re a man, Lan Zhan.”\n\n*Manhood* does not constitute *scarring,* but Lan Wangji doesn’t feel like revisiting the headache of heroic gestures and pretty girls. “It was an accident,” he says in clipped tones. \n\n“Of course it was, but you don’t *tell* people that. You make up a good story. One where you’re brave and the hero.”\n\nLan Wangji tries to resist. He really does try to resist. “Like falling out of trees, or being thrown off a pier?”\n\nWei Wuxian’s face lights up the way only his face lights up when a worthy opponent bests him. “Ha!” he says. “Exactly. Or knocking pots off a stove.”\n\nHe is grinning, and waiting to see if Lan Wangji will join him. When he doesn’t, Wei Wuxian laughs, undaunted, and rolls back over to resume tossing the stick in the air. \n\n---- \n\n“It’s so boring. I’m so bored,” Wei Wuxian says for the third time that hour, as if this is Lan Wangji’s fault. \n\nThe third day. Lan Wangji is reasonably sure of this, if only because of the hollow pains in his stomach, and the fact his leg can bear some weight. Wei Wuxian, sitting next to him, is tossing pebbles at a stick he’s stuck in the ground. He yawns hugely, then pouts when this too fails to get Lan Wangji’s attention.\n\n“Lan Zhan,” he says. \n\nLan Wangji, who has been trying to meditate—albeit with modifications, as his leg doesn’t allow for his preferred lotus pose—chooses the one response that is sure to provoke Wei Wuxian. Silence. \n\n“Lan Zhan?” A pebble clicks. “Lan Zhan.”\n\nLan Wangji waits for one more *Lan Zhan,* the one that stretches the last syllable into a whine, before he opens his eyes. \n\n“Do you do this a lot?” Wei Wuxian asks, indicating Lan Wangji’s state of interrupted serenity, as if this was the urgent question that just had to be asked. \n\nLan Wangji looks at him. \n\n“You do, don’t you? Like for days at a time, by yourself?”\n\n“Self-discipline is good for proper cultivation.”\n\nWei Wuxian screws up his face, disapproval mixed with contemplation. \n\n“Don’t you meditate?” Lan Wangji asks, afraid to hear the answer. \n\n“Of course. Once a day, usually. But lots of other things too. That’s not *all* I do.” A long pause, during which he tosses a pebble. “Don’t you get lonely?” \n\nLan Wangji blinks. He had anticipated scorn, at the very least gentle teasing. Wei Wuxian looks at him, serious. \n\n“I’d get so lonely,” he says. He flicks another pebble with precision at the stick. “I like having people around, to do things. It doesn’t have to be much. Just to talk to, at least. Don’t you like someone to talk to, Lan Zhan?”\n\n*No,* is the obvious and correct answer to that—the word sticks on his tongue, unable to make himself say it before Wei Wuxian continues. \n\n“It’s nice to have that, especially when you’re not used to silence all the time. Lotus Pier isn’t quiet, like Cloud Recesses. There’s always something to do. Swimming, or fishing. Picnics. Flying kites. What’s your favorite thing to do, just for fun? Do you like flying kites?” \n\nLan Wangji watches a pebble skid wide. “I do sword drills,” he says. \n\n“That’s work, Lan Zhan. I said fun.”\n\n“I read books.”\n\nWei Wuxian looks at him again.\n\n“I *like* books,” Lan Wangji says. \n\n“Lan Zhan,” he says. “Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan.” Wei Wuxian cups his palm, passing him a handful of pebbles. “Of course *you’d* rather have *books* than swimming in rivers.”\n\nLan Wangji rolls a pebble on the pad of his thumb. He hesitates, then tosses it. It neatly taps the stick. “There are cold springs for bathing.”\n\nWei Wuxian doesn’t have to say *bathing* isn’t *swimming.* “If we were in Yunmeng, I’d take you to the river,” he says. “It’s so hot in the summer, you’d have to live in the water. You’d probably get sunburnt and the skin would peel off your nose, but I’d help you stay in the shade. We’d catch carp, with our bare hands. Have you ever done that, Lan Zhan? I’d cook them for you on the fire, just like this, and you could sleep in the grass while our clothes dried, tired out from all the times I chased you underwater.”\n\nA pebble skitters, landing short. Lan Wangji selects another. \n\n“You’d like that, I know, even though you’d never say it. Then I’d be such a good friend, you could meditate for hours and read all the books we have at Lotus Pier.” \n\nWei Wuxian bumps his shoulder. He smiles at him sideways as his pebble lands closer than Lan Wangji’s did. \n\n“I win, Lan Zhan,” he says, although there are no rules and no score and they haven’t really even been playing. He collects another handful of pebbles and starts over again. \n\n---- \n\n“*No,*” Lan Wangji snaps, pain clawing in every direction as he moves too abruptly, blindly shoving the tangled mess of black hair and red ribbon off of his lap. Wei Wuxian, bleary with sleep, recoils backwards, affronted.\n\n“What the—? Lan Zhan!” \n\n“*No,*” Lan Wangji says with force. He is bleary with sleep too. And pain. And hunger. And anger. And helplessness. \n\nHe has *possibly* overreacted. But Wei Wuxian in his lap, sound asleep, had not been a scenario he anticipated waking up to.\n\n“The ground is so rocky. You *told* me to sleep,” Wei Wuxian says.\n\n“Sleep. Over *there,*” Lan Wangji says, his usual economy of words reduced even more. \n\nWei Wuxian looks at the designated stretch of rocky ground. “It’s not like I hurt you,” he grumbles. “You just sleep sitting there, anyway. I didn’t jostle your leg. It’s the other side. I was *careful.*” \n\nIt is indeed the other side, which has also kept Lan Wangji closest to the fire, but they aren’t discussing these considerations.\n\n“I thought you wouldn’t care,” Wei Wuxian goes on, exaggerating his contriteness for sympathy. He yawns. “I’m so *tired.*” \n\nLan Wangji closes his eyes, then opens them quickly in case that encourages Wei Wuxian to put his head back in his lap. “You can’t—” he says.\n\nWei Wuxian waits. \n\n“You can’t just—”\n\nWei Wuxian yawns again, not putting it on this time. “I didn’t think you would care,” he repeats more seriously, which has to be the biggest lie he has told in recent memory. Of course Lan Wangji always *cares* about being touched, or hauled around, or having his ribbon stripped off and tied around other limbs. Wei Wuxian knows these things and does them anyway, and it’s been a long time since Lan Wangji has done anything but allow it.\n\nWei Wuxian retreats, taking the outer robe he had draped across Lan Wangji and pointedly crumpling it into a pillow to stuff under his head, well out of reach, on the other side of the fire. He glares at Lan Wangji, laying his head down with a sigh of long-suffering. \n\nLan Wangji leans back, closing his eyes, willing his heartbeat to subside to a reasonable pace. Pain stabs him like a knife, his leg throbbing. He counts through a few breaths, trying to release the worst of the ache, along with the tension that is laced in tight knots through his shoulders. \n\nHis mind proves harder to quiet. He is unable to sweep his thoughts away, make his mind a blank slate. Reason creeps back in, as does logic. As does a not-insubstantial amount of shame. The fire crackles calmly, and it’s with dread curling in the pit of his stomach that he finally says, “Wei Ying.”\n\nWei Wuxian is not sleeping. He continues pretending he is. Lan Wangji could do that too, accept the excuse with gratitude and face it all again in the… whatever passes for morning in the dark underground. \n\n“Wei Ying.”\n\nWei Wuxian stirs, performatively sulking a little. \n\nLan Wangji says it a third time, “Wei Ying,” and Wei Wuxian cracks an eye open in his direction. \n\nLan Wangji sighs. He is not going to make this easy. Or maybe he is, because then Wei Wuxian says, after the silence goes on too long, “What, Lan Zhan? Is that you saying, ‘sorry, Wei Ying, I was being ridiculous’?”\n\nLan Wangji nods, once. It’s Wei Wuxian’s turn to sigh. \n\n“Fine. Whatever. It’s okay.”\n\nSomehow that makes it worse, this pit of dread and shame writhing in Lan Wangji’s belly. It’s not okay. It never has been. “I—” There are words that won’t form, a whole language that has never been at home on his tongue. That might not even exist. “I don’t—”\n\nWei Wuxian rolls onto his belly, propping up on his elbows, his hair falling out of its ribbon and over his shoulders. “I didn’t mean to freak you out, okay? I mean, lots of times I do. It’s fun to tease you. Need Lan Zhan to cough up blood? I’ll get naked! I *thought,* though, that it was maybe because you actually… you know, you’d thought about it so that’s why it…” Maybe there are words that fail Wei Wuxian too. He clears his throat, cheeks pink, and tries again. “You know, how there are things you’ve decided you can’t have because you’re ridiculous and a Lan but you like it when I make you do them anyway. Like eat sweets. Or miss curfew. Or…”\n\n*Kiss you,* Lan Wangji thinks. A knot is lodged in his throat. It’s the closest they’ve come to acknowledging that happened.\n\nWei Wuxian is going valiantly on. “—wouldn’t ever if you didn’t really want me to, though. I thought you did, is all. But if you don’t…”\n\nLan Wangji swallows. He nods before Wei Wuxian can finish the sentence. Before he can realize he’s nodding and stop himself. \n\nWei Wuxian falters, face on the verge of falling. “You don’t?” \n\nNo. No, he meant—yes. He meant that Wei Wuxian is right. Yes to all of it. He wants it all, and he wants the plausible deniability of pretending he does not want, and perhaps it has reached the point where he can no longer have both. He closes his eyes, tired and hungry and miserable enough to admit which one he would rather give up. “Yes,” he says, making his throat form the word. \n\n“Yes, what?”\n\n“Yes I do. Want that. I…”\n\nThe admission almost chokes him, even with no one else around for miles. There is a long dreaded silence. Only because it is so long does he hear the slight scraping of pebbles, someone trying to move quietly in the dark. He opens his eyes, and Wei Wuxian is there. He has crawled over quietly, helpfully. Uncertainly. The sulk has fallen off his face; he looks as vulnerable now as Lan Wangji has ever seen him. \n\nLan Wangji’s heart feels like a bruise, raw and tender in his chest. He had thought he was the only one who felt desperately vulnerable. Wei Wuxian doesn’t fear anything. Wei Wuxian fights dire owls and demon tortoises; he taunts Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu with merry exuberance. The look on his face says that Wei Wuxian fears this.\n\nLan Wangji does not move a muscle, which makes Wei Wuxian tentatively respond to that welcome, crawling down and resting his head cautiously on Lan Wangji’s lap. \n\nThe panic still flaps in his chest, the same as when Wei Wuxian says things like *I’ll carry you* or starts stripping off clothing. It flaps, but then it—settles. Touch, the thing he’s been so frightened of, does not obliterate him after all. Light as a bird that is still fledging its feathers, he rests his hand on Wei Wuxian’s head.\n\nWei Wuxian peeks up. “Lan Zhan, do not throw up on my head.”\n\nIn reply, Lan Wangji digs his fingers into his hair and tugs sharply. \n\nWei Wuxian gasps, then snuggles down, apparently reassured of his welcome. When Lan Wangji politely removes his hand, Wei Wuxian politely places it back. Unaccustomed to this, Lan Wangji haltingly strokes the tangled mass of his hair. Then he strokes it again. It is silk, and he idly and carefully begins to unknot it, combing his fingers down through the long length, allowed to have this, a gift received more than given. \n\nWei Wuxian almost purrs, drowsy with contentment. Lan Wangji’s mind snags on that, flooded suddenly with a memory nearly a decade old. He couldn’t have been more than eight; they kept a sleek gray mouser in the kitchens, and he was the first to discover the litter of kittens she had birthed in secret. It’s a sense memory, rare and precious, his little heart bursting with wonder over a lap full of tiny, warm, wriggling things, falling all over themselves to let him pet and cuddle them for hours on end.\n\nHe had been punished for that, discovered when he never heard the bell calling him to the evening meal. He was pulled to his feet, marched back to the dormitories, harshly scolded for lack of discipline, and for weeks he had searched through every nook, cranny and bolt-hole he could find in Cloud Recesses but the kittens were never seen again. \n\nWei Wuxian, in his lap, has turned his head up to look at him. Lan Wangji’s hand has gone still; Wei Wuxian is checking, uncertain again, to see if the permission has been revoked. \n\nLan Wangji resumes stroking his scalp, unsnarling a strand of hair from the red ribbon. Satisfied, Wei Wuxian settles back down, closing his eyes and allowing himself to drift back towards sleep. \n\n---- \n\n“I like your cold springs cave better,” Wei Wuxian decides, the fourth day. “Lan Yi was nice, and it was beautiful, and there were bunnies to play with.”\n\nThe steady chill, the stale air, has made Wei Wuxian overcompensate with the fire. He’s built it up too high, and they’re enduring it, sweating through their robes. Even so, it is a preposterous statement—and one Lan Wangji is willing to allow for the sake of distraction.\n\n“Mn,” he says, neutrally enough that Wei Wuxian will not be able to easily discern whether it means yes or no.\n\nWei Wuxian lifts up his hair, piling it on top of his head, leaning back against the wall. A bead of sweat slides down his neck. “Winter. Cloud Recesses. Lan Zhan. Tell me stories.”\n\nLan Wangji can feel the sweat prickling his scalp, pooling on his spine. He makes himself look sharply away from Wei Wuxian’s glistening neck.\n\n“Lan Zhan. Winter. Cloud Recesses,” Wei Wuxian repeats like snapping his fingers to get his attention. He closes his eyes and sighs dreamily. “There must be so much snow.”\n\nLan Wangji is worn out enough, his defenses down enough, that *snow* twists in his heart, another lingering sense-memory that should have faded long before now. “There is snow,” he agrees.\n\n“And it’s beautiful.” \n\n“It’s very beautiful.”\n\nWei Wuxian hums appreciatively. “Have you been in the cold springs when it’s winter?”\n\nHe has been in the cold springs in every type of weather imaginable. He has been when snow drops on the surface, when the air is so bone-chilling that his teeth clack uncontrollably, so cold the water’s almost warm, his senses all confused. He has followed cold down through the very concept of cold, down through pain, out to some heady precipice where it just feels effervescent and numbing. It’s like… he’s not exactly sure what it’s like. He once sat down with ink, brush, and paper, tried to put it in a poem, and failed.\n\nHe tells Wei Wuxian the first part, the way the snow touches the water and doesn’t immediately melt.\n\n“You’d *have* to get naked then,” Wei Wuxian muses, almost to himself. “If you got out in wet robes you’d freeze to death on the spot before you could get dry or warm.” \n\nSo then there’s heat now, more of it, just when Lan Wangji had almost conjured the mental sensation of cold. He can feel his skin, livid. He is tired and filthy and it’s not too dramatic to say he is dying of hunger—this should not be difficult.\n\n“Lan Zhan, *do* you get naked?”\n\n“Wei Ying,” he tries to say sharply. Instead, he sounds a little hoarse. \n\nWei Wuxian says nothing, which is so unprecedented that Lan Wangji makes the fatal mistake of opening his eyes to look.\n\nWei Wuxian is smiling. He is lounging back against the rock, one arm on his head, a pile of inky hair slipping down his neck, looking like a picture in a book that Lan Wangji should not know exists. He is watching Lan Wangji, and smiling. Not even wickedly. Just a smile that is lovely and knowing, that could make a man walk off a cliff and fall to his death.\n\n“*Wei Ying,*” Wei Wuxian growls softly, imitating Lan Wangji’s voice. \n\n“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says, since that seems to be all he can say.\n\nWei Wuxian’s face changes. He reads Lan Wangji’s face, finds something there that makes the knowing drop away, the pure loveliness remain. Lan Wangji’s breath catches in his throat. The moment stretches out like honey pulled out of its comb, their gazes locked, the blazing heat on his face and the crackling glow of the fire.\n\nWhich one of them tips forward first, he doesn’t know. All he knows is that Wei Wuxian meets him, already there when Lan Wangji lays their faces together and touches his lips with the dry, burning heat of his own.\n\nWei Wuxian kisses him back, a *rightness* about it that threads down his spine. It’s a shiver, in the heat. \n\nThey don’t pull apart; the kiss ends, and they stay, lips close, breath mingling. So close that it doesn’t take anything, Wei Wuxian’s fingers sliding around the back of his neck, to bring him back in. \n\nLan Wangji has not had a drop of liquor this time. His head swims with it anyway, the soft press and drag of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, lips chapped from days of rationing water. He is dizzy with the knowledge that he can have this again, dizzy with the slightly clumsy way Wei Wuxian is pressing against him. Dizzy with the way he’s kissing Wei Wuxian back. Clumsy too, so full of need, heart pounding so hard it aches in his skull. His stomach clenches with pleasure. Wei Wuxian hisses softly like hot stones hitting water. \n\nLan Wangji’s hand has slid down over his chest, where it hurts, where the brand is. He pulls it back, stricken. \n\nWincing, Wei Wuxian rubs at the wound, then shakes his head, leans back in.\n\nThis time it is the sharp intake of Lan Wangji’s breath that stops them, pain searing down through his leg when Wei Wuxian brushes against it. “Sorry, Lan Zhan,” he whispers, sucking in air through his teeth, wincing on his behalf.\n\nThe reality of their circumstances is demanding attention. There is nothing ideal about it—they are hot, cramped, trapped, exhausted, lightheaded from hunger, in pain. They bump noses, adjust their weight, shift position, try again. And then Wei Wuxian is pulling back, letting his hands drop away without Lan Wangji’s permission.\n\nIt is like before, the kiss pulling out like the tide, leaving Lan Wangji on the shore. To clutch at it is to have it slide through his fingers like water. \n\nAt least this time there is no pledge to never speak of it again. Wei Wuxian sits back, still close enough for their sleeves to brush. He picks a piece of ash off Lan Wangji’s robe, then smoothes a wrinkle, fussy little touches that don’t help calm the racing of Lan Wangji’s heart. And then Lan Wangji is looking up because he’s gotten to his feet. \n\n“I should—” Wei Wuxian says, and trails off. He gestures instead, a vague flop of his arm, disappearing into the darkness before Lan Wangji can make his tongue form the words, *come back.*\n\n---- \n\nLater, by the fire. Wei Wuxian sits beside him, running his dark outer robe through his hands, holding it at various angles for the crackling fire to dry. \n\nIt is small now, the fire, died back to reasonable proportions. Wei Wuxian has brought back the robe dripping wet from the pond, his own face freshly scrubbed, letting Lan Wangji wash the soot and sweat off his skin. Tomorrow, he will don it again, along with the belt and vambraces, and they will fight a monster. \n\nThat accounts partially for the mood by the fire. They cannot keep waiting for rescue. Now is the last, best chance they have. Lan Wangji’s leg can bear more weight than yesterday; if they wait longer, they’ll be weaker. Together they share the nightly ration of water, swallow the last of the medicine. The little burst of spring sunshine arrives, fainter now, but still there.\n\n“Wei Ying,” he says, when he can stand it no longer. \n\nWei Wuxian, lost in thought, looks up and blinks in Lan Wangji’s direction. “Hmm?”\n\n“I—” Lan Wangji says. \n\nWei Wuxian folds the robe up, discarding it, and shifts around to face him, crossing his arms on his knees. Lan Wangji’s thoughts scatter like pebbles. \n\n“What?” Wei Wuxian prompts him, after a moment. “Oh no. Lan Zhan. Is this where you tell me you’re sorry? Say how much you like Mianmian?”\n\nIt’s a tease, like the first time. Wei Wuxian drawing him out, never as careless or oblivious as he lets on, but he says it a little bit recklessly, as if nerves get the better of him despite trying to hide it.\n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says. \n\n“You *are* going to say sorry. That’s your sorry voice.”\n\n“No.”  \n\nHe is not going to say that. It twists in his gut, like the way his hands twist in his robes, how un-sorry he is. But—there is something, Wei Wuxian is not completely wrong. \n\n“I never—I have only—” Lan Wangji swallows. He can do this. “If I did something badly, it would be helpful to know.” He announces it to the fire, his palms damp where his fists rest on his knees.\n\nOnce again, though, he finds himself looking over when Wei Wuxian doesn’t answer. \n\n“How would *I* know?” Wei Wuxian asks him sincerely. “Lan Zhan. How many people do you think I have kissed?”\n\nLan Wangji was not expecting that question. He tries to think, safely. “…Many?”\n\nWei Wuxian’s smile is slow-blooming and lazy and utterly provocative. “One,” he says. \n\n“One…?”\n\n“*You,*” he says, in case Lan Wangji is slow. “So I’m flattered I am so obviously excellent at it that I must have kissed hundreds of people, Lan Zhan, but alas, I am naturally gifted, only you, I have been perfectly virtuous, saving myself for—ow!”\n\nIt feels wonderful to throw a handful of stones at him. Only once before has Lan Wangji given into that physical impulse—in the library, tearing an explicit book to shreds in his hands. It helps him rebalance, calm the head-spin from *one, you, only you.*\n\n“So if you would like to do it again—”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWei Wuxian halts mid-sentence. It is wonderful too, to throw him so badly. Even if Lan Wangji blurted the word before he could think. \n\n“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says.\n\n“Yes.” Lan Wangji nods.\n\n“You want to—”\n\nNods.\n\n“Here?”\n\nNods.\n\n“But your leg?”\n\n“Is not falling off.” There are limits to Lan Wangji’s patience. \n\nWei Wuxian gulps, bravado slipping. Lan Wangji, committed to this path of destruction, watches the slide of his throat. \n\n“Now?” he says again. \n\nLan Wangji, sometimes, is forced to take initiative. He can’t exactly rise up on his knees; instead, he drags Wei Wuxian over by the front of his robe into the full force of his kiss. \n\nWei Wuxian kind of—*mmumphs.* They collide. It does jar his leg, but Lan Wangji is briefly beyond caring. He does not let Wei Wuxian go; when he finally pulls back, Wei Wuxian stares at him, eyes huge, then coughs and breaks into laughter that sheds more warmth than the fire. \n\n“Lan Zhan!” he exclaims, scandalized, and pushes their mouths back together with no finesse whatsoever. He is half in Lan Wangji’s lap before good sense arrives and he darts backwards enough to avoid Lan Wangji’s leg. \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji says irrationally, not releasing his grip on the front of Wei Wuxian’s robe. \n\nWei Wuxian pats his hand gently, prying his fingers loose. “I have an idea,” he assures him, which has never *not* struck fear in Lan Wangji’s heart. Before he knows how to accommodate this turn of events, Wei Wuxian has climbed across him, dropping over to his good side. He taps Lan Wangji’s knee, the one that does not make his head spin in agony. “Lan Zhan. Open your legs.”\n\nAt Lan Wangji’s look, he rolls his eyes so dramatically they might fall out of his head. \n\n“So I don’t hurt the bad one,” he says. \n\nOh. Lan Wangji… obeys. Wei Wuxian straddles his good leg, perching there, one knee between them, keeping most of his weight off of Lan Wangji’s thigh.\n\n“How’s this?” he asks. “Hurts?”\n\nLan Wangji checks. He shakes his head no. \n\n“Good,” Wei Wuxian says. He licks his lips, surveying the options for his next course of action. He settles down a bit more, so they’re mostly face to face, resting his hands on Lan Wangji’s shoulders. Then he frowns, taking Lan Wangji’s empty hands, placing one on the back of his neck, the other safely at his waist, out of reach of the still-tender brand. “All right?”\n\n*No.* Very much *not all right.* Very much *not ever going to be all right again.* \n\nLan Wangji jerks his head in a nod. \n\nThe smile returns, the one from before, the slow-blooming one, full of delight and lazy provocation. Wei Wuxian’s hands come back to rest on Lan Wangji’s shoulders. He leans in, close enough that his breath ghosts over his lips. “Lan Zhan?”\n\nLan Wangji, staring at the way Wei Wuxian’s mouth glistens, red as a berry, says, “Mn?”\n\n“Kiss me.”\n\nLan Wangji finds his hands are shaking. This is… real, without the plausible deniability of impulse or frustration or even the helpful pretext of inebriation. He can’t help it, he freezes, too much to process at once, and if he does this wrong— \n\nWei Wuxian huffs fondly, tips his face up and kisses him. \n\nIt’s a *kiss.* Slow and real, and intent, not the clumsy crushing of mouths he had attempted. Lan Wangji’s grip tightens, fingers digging into his waist, into the nape of his neck. Wei Wuxian gasps softly. Heat that is not from the fire curls up Lan Wangji’s spine. \n\nWei Wuxian, when they part, brushes his thumb across Lan Wangji’s cheek. “Ahh. Lan Zhan *does* blush,” he whispers, and more heat, more color floods beneath Lan Wangji’s skin. Grinning, Wei Wuxian bumps him with his nose. He kisses him there, then next to his ear, experimenting. “*You* wanted this, Lan Zhan,” he reminds him, dropping down to nuzzle his neck, a tender spot that sends a flurry of sparks cascading down through his body. \n\nLan Wangji is going to combust. He will not get to fight a demon tortoise; he will be a pile of ash on the ground long before rescue comes. He makes a strangled sound in his throat—Wei Wuxian rewards it with laughter, a puff of air that chases shivers up and down Lan Wangji’s skin. \n\n“Wei Ying,” he croaks. \n\n“Mm?”\n\nHis protest dies a swift death on his tongue. It was reflex anyway, the habit of protesting anything Wei Wuxian does—useless when he would let Wei Wuxian do anything, as long as *anything* involves the delicate swirl of his tongue just below Lan Wangji’s ear. It feels exquisite. It’s mortifying. He makes another pained and very undignified sound, and Wei Wuxian detaches abruptly to look at his face.\n\n“Lan Zhan, is that weird? If it’s weird, you can—”\n\nOh, for— In exasperation, Lan Wangji pulls Wei Wuxian back down to his mouth. Laughter spills out between them. Wei Wuxian’s laughter, his mouth falling open until the tip of Lan Wangji’s tongue brushes the tip of his own and his laughter chokes off into a soft, startled sound. \n\nIt’s instinct, that’s all. It’s not knowledge or skill; just instinct that brings their mouths back together, deliberate this time as they both take a breath, Wei Wuxian’s eyes falling closed as Lan Wangji opens up and lets him all the way in. \n\nThey both make a sound when their tongues touch. Heat floods odd places on Lan Wangji’s body—the inside of his elbows, his thighs, the top of his scalp.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/3-unclean-realm":{"title":"Chapter 3 — Unclean Realm","content":"\nWei Wuxian is dead. \n\nTwo months, then three. That’s what people begin saying. \n\n*Beat him like a sandbag,* a Wen soldier boasts. Laughter. *Showed that arrogant brat.* Snap of a cord around a neck. \n\nNobody has answers. Jin Zixuan says, *His sister says it isn’t like him…* Jiang Wanyin says, *We thought he went to Lanling for you.* \n\nIt’s unthinkable, what else they say. Burial Mounds. No one survives it. Nobody returns from that place with body or soul intact, not even Wei Wuxian.\n\nThis is war, and that’s warfare: wild and unfounded rumors. Lan Wangji tells himself that. He holds out hope, he builds defenses. Becomes as stubborn as he has ever been in his life. Wei Wuxian would be proud. Wei Wuxian would call him a ridiculous person. Wei Wuxian would tackle him with exuberance, say, *Lan Zhan, I’m all right! What were you thinking, you really did all that for me?*\n\nThis is not what happens. \n\nThis happens instead: Wen Chao dies, and Wei Wuxian lives. It’s Lan Wangji’s wildest dream, and it comes true like a nightmare. Like a ghost that stands before him in Wei Wuxian’s robes, alive in Wei Wuxian’s body, and not Wei Wuxian at all. \n\n*Who do you think you are?* this new Wei Wuxian asks him, dark eyes that don’t spark with laughter, a smile that doesn’t reach past his lips. *Second Young Master Lan. Hanguang-jun. Lan Wangji*—the cold reversal of every intimacy that Wei Wuxian has ever given him. Malevolent energy so tangible it almost coils in the air. \n\nAll Lan Wangji can think, in that moment and after, through the turmoil and betrayal: \n\n*Who are* you? *Wei Ying, what on earth have you done?*\n\n---- \n\nIt is an artful performance—no wonder Lan Wangji endures an excruciating week of believing it.\n\nHe takes grim solace in the guqin. Wei Wuxian is hailed a hero. “Lan Wangji,” he says politely whenever they cross each other’s path, slid like a knife between his ribs. \n\nRumors fly that they’re fighting, but it’s nothing so clear cut as a fight, it’s just confusion and distance. Lan Wangji craves a fight, fights make Wei Wuxian *smile,* a clash of swords like a dance except Wei Wuxian won’t even carry Suibian around with him, not even to deflect suspicion.\n\n“Young Master Wei has always been difficult,” Xichen notes wryly. (Xichen, who has returned himself, also changed, also more polite than ever, a new shadow in his eyes.)\n\nIt’s more than Lan Wangji can bear. He sits awake in the tender, bruised-purple hour before dawn, calming his mind with meditation, when the tiny splinter of a thought finally pushes to the fore. \n\nEverything about this feels familiar. Cool silence, cutting words—it’s Lan Wangji’s own tactics, turned against him. How he tried to survive it, that interminable summer in Cloud Recesses, in so deep over his head he couldn’t see a way out. Or the long days in Qishan, needing to keep Wei Wuxian out of harm’s way, desperately feigning indifference while Wen Chao stalked them like a wolf. \n\nWhatever Wei Wuxian has done—he is trying to guard Lan Wangji from it. Or whatever has been done to him—he is trying to stubbornly survive it himself. \n\nWhich is just… fuck, it’s *just like him.* Noble and *stupid* and it’s all Lan Wangji can do to not fly across the compound, drag him out of bed, throttle sense into him until Wei Wuxian capitulates and gives him the *truth.* \n\nHe is more subtle than that, in the end—although not by much. If Wei Wuxian wants to play by old tactics, then Lan Wangji will give him old tactics. He pulls Bichen, drives him back with a flurry of his most vicious sword work. It feels *right,* like a kiss, to land the blade at his throat.\n\nIt works. It’s their old language, provocation and combat, the calling of each other’s bluff. Lan Wangji’s heart sings like the blade he drops back in its sheath as Wei Wuxian finally, *finally,* sweet as a taste of cool water, meets Lan Wangji’s gaze, like the Wei Wuxian he knows.\n\n---- \n\nThey talk, on the rooftop. The first tentative forging of a new path between them. There are still acres of terrain that Wei Wuxian is avoiding—Lan Wangji lets him. He has every intention of not giving up, of plying trust out of him the way Wei Wuxian plied him first, with friendship, with relentless, dogged endurance, not content until Lan Wangji was malleable clay in his hands. \nIt’s not enough, and it’s a start. The first green shoot of spring after a desolate winter. Lan Wangji would stay there all night; it’s Wei Wuxian who leaves. *Yes,* he agrees, though, to Lan Wangji’s offer of help. Wicked tricks, crafty tricks, Lan Wangji isn’t sure the semantics matter. It’s just like Wei Wuxian to go and do something rash, but whatever he’s done, Lan Wangji can believe that he had his reasons, and they can solve it together. \nBack in his rooms, Xichen appears in the doorway as Lan Wangji plays the qin. He stands there quietly, listening for a while until Lan Wangji moves through the coda, resting his hands on the strings instead of looping the melody endlessly again. \n“I haven’t heard that piece before,” Xichen says, and something soft twinges in Lan Wangji’s chest—how long they have been apart; how much has changed for him without his brother’s knowledge. It feels disloyal, almost, to hold secrets from him. To not disclose what has happened, where part of his loyalties lie. \n“Mn,” is all he says. \n“It’s lovely. May I join you?”\nLan Wangji assents. His brother draws out Liebing, and the sudden association of a flute makes Lan Wangji pause. After a moment, he asks—are there Lan temperament techniques he might not be aware of, more advanced methods than the ones he was taught? \n“Perhaps,” Xichen says thoughtfully. “If we…” He trails off, unable to finish the sentence. *If we return to Cloud Recesses… if it’s rebuilt, if those texts still exist…* “I will see what I can find for you,” he says, and offers Lan Wangji a wan smile. \n\n---- \n\nLan Wangji slips back into the background, ceding Xichen his rightful place as the head of the clan. He is more than happy to do it. Leadership doesn’t suit him; too much finesse is needed, a level of political tact that is quite frankly beyond him. He still attends the long meetings, the endless hours of plotting strategy, but only as an auxiliary. No one looks to him to speak, which is a relief, especially when tempers flare, the strain wearing them down the way a millstone grinds charcoal into a fuel that needs only a spark to ignite. \nJiang Wanyin is just as ill-suited for the role, both deferential and belligerent, wearing his newfound authority like an ill-fitting cloak. \nHe clashes with Wei Wuxian daily. It becomes a common occurrence to hear one or both of their voices rising, bouncing off the courtyard walls. Lan Wangji, if he’s in earshot, places himself nearby, in case Wei Wuxian should wish for an escape. It irks Jiang Wanyin, who’s regained his old habit of scowling at Lan Wangji for the mere fact of his existence, their uneasy truce collapsing. \n“He’s just worried,” Wei Wuxian says after one of their spats, sounding tired, sounding restless, falling into his old habit too of defending his brother. “Shijie says he’s not sleeping.”\n“Are you?” Lan Wangji asks. \n“Ha! Me? Lan Zhan. I sleep *too much,* like a baby. You can’t even wake me in the mornings.”\nIt’s a lie, and a transparent one. Lan Wangji rises before dawn, and too often now he finds Wei Wuxian awake during those hours, prowling around on some errand or toying with notes on his flute. “Oh no,” Wei Wuxian says, whenever Lan Wangji appears in whatever tucked-away corner where he’s failed to hide himself. “Young Master Lan is here to scold me.”\nLan Wangji does not. He unwraps pancakes, or fruit, or stolen cakes from the kitchens, and sits down beside him, sharing the small meal in silence, usually while a rosy dawn breaks. He’s tamed wild rabbits; the principle is not all that different, with the right application of patience and rewards they eat out of his hands.

In that way, it’s easier this time—it was in Yiling where Wei Wuxian went missing before, presumed dead for three months, and now it has only been one. Not dead, not missing, but cut off from the cultivation world like an unwelcome limb.\n\nLan Wangji is with Xichen the day the letter arrives. Xichen unfolds it, reading in silence for several long minutes without changing his expression. \n\n“Brother,” Lan Wangji says, when he can stand it no longer. \n\nBrushwork that elegant, paper that fine; it can only be from Lanling. Xichen looks up, relaying Jin Guangyao’s account of how he has been working day and night in preparation for the wedding. \n\nThat is not Lan Wangji’s concern. “And?” he says. \n\nAn infinitesimal pause; an infinitesimal shake of his head. “He won’t be attending,” Xichen says. “They thought it prudent… not to inform him.”\n\nBirds flit in the autumn-bright branches around them, unaffected by the news, by the petty, bloodless cruelties humans will inflict on each other. *Not inform him.* It’s only the marriage of the person he loves most in the world. (To the person he despises most in the world.) Jiang Yanli is not behind this, of that at least Lan Wangji is certain. \n\n“He should know,” Lan Wangji says, trying to keep his voice neutral. \n\nXichen does not disagree. “But that is for his clan, and the Jins… it is not our place to say.” \n\nNot their place. The blood feud between the Jins and the Wen refugees—not their place. Cultivators killed, Wei Wuxian exiled—not their place. \n\n“Wangji,” Xichen says, warning. “It wouldn’t be wise, if you wrote to inform him.” \n\n“No,” Lan Wangji agrees. \n\n“Promise me that you won’t.” \n\n“Write to him? I won’t,” Lan Wangji says.\n\n---- \n\nYiling buzzes like a wasp’s nest. It’s almost comforting, really—Wei Wuxian must be nearby.\n\nThe intensity of the rumors, the wild distortions, are worse here than in Gusu. Yiling-laozhu, they’ve started calling him, the kind of puerile game one doesn’t always outgrow in childhood, creating monsters or villains in order to play the hero. Lan Wangji can only imagine how much Wei Wuxian is feeding these rumors himself, entertained by the tales. This isn’t supposed to be a *game.* \n\nEvery teahouse, every tavern, has a variation of the tale, each more outlandish than the last. Of course it’s not only that—other minor rumors and dramas still grip the populace too. But that’s what Lan Wangji’s ear is tuned for, and so that is what he hears. \n\nGhouls and demons—no, fierce corpses! *Armies* of the dead. Virgin orgies; infant sacrifices. *If anything, Wei Wuxian would not be that organized,* Lan Wangji thinks wryly, would tell anyone who would listen. \n\nNobody is interested in the truth. The lies that bother him most are the ones that most closely echo what was said in Jinlintai. Wei Wuxian is a traitor; Wei Wuxian is mediocre at best; if not for the mercy of the Jiangs he’d be on the streets where he belongs, and look what he’s done to repay them. \n\nOr—worst of all: someone like him doesn’t deserve to live.\n\nIt’s that last one that drives Lan Wangji out of the teahouse into Yiling’s bustling main street. The harsh glare of sunlight, stares from the crowd. A tiny, dusty child in brown robes who collides with Lan Wangji’s legs, depositing himself at his feet. \n\nLan Wangji stares down. The little boy clings like a limpet, a bright-eyed grin that says no one has taught him this is not a proper thing to do. “No…?” Lan Wangji says, afraid it comes out like a question. Of the two of them, he’s not the one who bursts into tears. \n\n---\n\n*This* is your fearsome Yiling-laozhu, Lan Wangji thinks more than once, once he is able to think. \n\nIt is a heartstopping sight, Wei Wuxian parting the crowds like the clouds that can’t hide the sun. Collecting the boy by the hand—because of course Wei Wuxian has somehow acquired a *child* when he’s supposed to be busy raising armies of corpses. Drying his tears, dusting his robes. Swordfighting with toys in the street, flying paper-winged butterflies, the two of them turning twin grins upon him like they are *trying* to stop Lan Wangji’s heart.\n\nThis is the Wei Wuxian he knows. The undimmed sunlight of him, none of the fury from Lanling, or the cold and miserable distance the last time he reappeared from the dead. He is changed—still, again—frighteningly thin and shabbily dressed—but the old goodness shines through him, scrubbed clean and unclouded, at ease with himself in a way that Lan Wangji has not seen in a very long time. \n\nHe feels mauled by it, this unexpected turn of events, so far outside his experience that all he can do is be himself, slightly stiff, slightly bitchy, warm all over when that’s the Lan Wangji these two accept unequivocally, delighted with him, laying claim to him as easily as they do with each other.","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/7-interregenum":{"title":"Chapter 7 — Interregenum","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/private/cql/to-accept-what-must-be":{"title":"To Accept What Must Be","content":"\n[[private/cql/1 - cloud recesses|Chapter 1 - Cloud Recesses]]\n[[private/cql/2 - xuanwu cave|Chapter 2 - Xuanwu Cave]]\n[[private/cql/3 - unclean realm|Chapter 3 - Unclean Realm]]\n[[private/cql/4 - nightless city|Chapter 4 - Nightless City]]\n[[private/cql/5 - phoenix mountain|Chapter 5 - Pheonix Mountain]]\n[[private/cql/6 - burial mounds|Chapter 6 - Burial Mounds]]— *because of course Wei Wuxian has somehow acquired a* child *when he’s supposed to be busy raising armies of corpses.*\n[[private/cql/7 - interregenum|Chapter 7 - Interregenum]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":["cql","fic"]},"/series/":{"title":"series","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":[]},"/tags/belief-systems/":{"title":"belief systems","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":[]},"/tags/cql/":{"title":"cql","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":[]},"/tags/fresh-takes/":{"title":"fresh takes","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-11-19T02:58:05.018598296Z","tags":[]}}
