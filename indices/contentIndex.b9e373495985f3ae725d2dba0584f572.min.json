I’ve actually read it thrice, because I got the paperback via preorder, but then my friend Meg convinced me I could not miss the audio. She was 100% correct. And then I started the audio again over the long Thanksgiving weekend when a little comfort was needed. As per usual with Alexis Hall, there’s a lot of attention to dialect, and to hear Sam’s Liverpool voice brought to life makes the story. There’s a reason Will Watt has been winning awards for his performance, it’s perfection.\n\n(As if the cover isn’t a clue, the [[series/material world|Material World]] series shares a universe with [[series/london calling|London Calling]].

The plot is sketched out, not fleshed out—the side characters are props, the culprit is telegraphed from his first appearance on page, both the mystery and the romance are a series of scenes that happen without much tension or suspense, and the climax is [[notes/on firearms, trust and historical accuracy|sloppy to a fault]]. \n\nOne thing that bothers me in romance is when it’s taken for granted that the couple belongs together: i.e. they’re young, attractive, and available, so poof, they’re in love. As opposed to being drawn toward someone against expectation or reason, and all the complexity and growth that entails. It manifests a lot more often in straight romance than queer romance, for obvious reasons, which is why these m/f historicals keep failing me, even when I’m just in the mood for fluffy distraction.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:37.959464704Z","tags":[]},"/books/a-green-equinox":{"title":"A Green Equinox","content":"Sometimes you’re just in the mood for moody, queer af British novels with all the fraught gender politics and literary melodrama of the 1970’s.

Drastic measures were needed after so many historical romance duds lately, especially with duke in the title. I wanted something full of sweeping romance on a foggy moor, angst and glory and tenderness. This was the safest bet possible. \n\nI liked it the first time, but I *loved* it this time. Gracewood and his sister Miranda’s relationship stood out to me more than before, particularly how he has to unlearn the old patriarchal roles and see and hear her for who she is—an echo, of course, to his love story with Viola. *He* is the one expected to bear the responsibility for his actions, and to change—it’s not up to Miranda nor Viola to save him. Love and support him, yes. But neither the lover nor the sister must put their needs aside to tend solely to his.\n\nNow that’s a breath of air, and a welcome one. Add that to the gorgeous… \\*gestures\\*… everything else, and it’s one of those small things that adds up to a quiet revolution.\n\n\u003e *Small acts of defiance, he well knew, could become great acts of rebellion, and little intimacies could become alliances or passions that shaped lives and worlds.*\n\n\n---\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e “What other options? Men and women are permitted to interact in three ways: marriage, ruination, and polite indifference.” \n\n\u003e She had such a compelling… he did not have the word for it. A *completeness* somehow, from the toes of her slippers to the curl of her hair. Had she been a man, he would have called her dandyish. Except that carried an implication of excess or absurdity, and she was neither. ((Okay, see, *here* is the correct way to reference a dandy, none of [[books/how to fall for a scoundrel|the gross insult]] involved.))\n\n\u003e “In war we are all either meat or murderers.”\n\n\u003e “Nobody is as they were,” she said. “That is what life *is*.” \n\n\u003e It had never occurred to him to question beauty before. He’d always assumed it was obvious, fine eyes or a trim figure, rosebud lips or hair of whatever colour was currently fashionable. But it wasn’t. It was *details*. The way you could wait forever for the dimple to appear beside someone’s mouth, unable to imagine ever growing tired of seeing it.\n\n\u003e “I could never marry you, Gracewood. The world—”\n\u003e “Forgive my language, but”—his eyes were as steady on hers as the clasp upon her wrist, his mouth suddenly full of smiles— “fuck the world. I will change it for you if I have to.”\n\n\u003e Except Viola was beginning to like Lady Lillimere too—her blunt speech and careless manners, the smile that rarely reached her eyes. There was a sense of stagecraft about her, somehow, guiding attention to the cards in her hand, rather than the ones up her sleeve. It made Viola feel oddly safe, this reminder that everyone lived their own illusions, chose their own truths, performed their own quiet magic before indifferent crowds.\n\n\u003e “I am not sure love unshown is really love at all. What good does caring for a person do if you’re never there when they need you?”\n\n\u003e Young ladies planning such adventures rarely undertake them while dressed as re-animated corpses.\n\n\u003e “Now I find I have had my fill of a world that judges men by their capacity to hurt. You are not the villain of this story, Amberglass. You are no part of it at all.” ((I swear we better get the Amberglass book that AJH keeps promising. Or else.))\n\n\u003e Bare of cloud and strewn with stars as thick as dust motes, the edges of the Milky Way glistening sharply like the interior of a geode. There was at once something taunting in such beauty— and consoling too. \n\n\u003e “A man should not—” But then he stopped himself. Those words also belonged to an old life. “On second thought, fuck what a man should not. I’m grateful to you, Viola, for both your protection and your love.”\n\n\u003e “I fear I shall never understand men. After all, if you turn down someone’s proposal of marriage when they *haven’t* abducted you, *being* abducted does not make you better disposed towards them.”\n\n\u003e “You have nothing to be sorry for.”\n\u003e “It’s hard not to wonder if I’ve been at fault somehow.”\n\u003e “You have not,” Gracewood said firmly. “We tell ladies that their virtue is their shield, when it is no such thing. When the only true protection against the predations of powerful men is—”\n\u003e “A pistol?” suggested Miranda.\n\u003e “I was going to say a society of laws, the companionship of loyal friends, and a world that knows better.”\n\u003e Viola had joined them upon the road. “A pistol may prove easier to come by.”\n\n\u003e It was not an occasion to be sentimental. The night had been long and fraught and could have ended badly in so many ways. Could, in fact, end badly regardless. But still. What a marvel it was. What freedom. To be a woman unabashedly in love beneath a multitude of stars.\n\n\u003e “She’s a seventeen-year-old girl,” protested the Viscount. “What can she possibly know about her own wishes?”\n\u003e Gracewood’s gaze was as cold as winter seas. “More than you.”\n\n\u003e She didn’t know why she hesitated. For once, it wasn’t to make sport of him. It was just so vast and consuming a question that to answer at once seemed almost disrespectful. More than that, it seemed a waste, to rush past the moment when she could savour it, cling to it, and watch the details of her future come together like a pattern beneath her needle.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:37.959464704Z","tags":[]},"/books/a-ladys-guide-to-fortune-hunting":{"title":"A Lady’s Guide to Fortune-Hunting","content":"I didn’t love this quite as much as [[books/a lady's guide to scandal|book two]].

It’s so clever and so tender, wickedly funny and emotionally cathartic and full of dastardly-gothic-plots-with-a-twist. Everything with [[books/the secret lives of country gentlemen|the first book]] where I was like, I need to read the second book to know how I feel about it—yep. Second book delivered and then some.  \n  \nOnce again it is KJ Charles at her best. And it needs the first book to be so sprawling with its cast, so lavish with its setting, because this one hones right in, a sharp, focused story that _needs_ the sprawling, rich tapestry in the background. A contrast, a balance, that in my opinion is expertly done.  \n  \nFurthermore, I hereby declare: fuck grand gestures for good. I want [Pat/Pran level tears](https://youtu.be/Bqe09a1xL3I?feature=shared\u0026t=723), sob-your-heart-out-and-all-I’m-gonna-do-is-hold-you emotional safety. If your romance can’t support that, is it even really a romance? Give me the intimacy and catharsis; nothing else will do.  \n  \n(It’s not really a spoiler to say KJC delivers exactly that too.)  \n  \nAdditional notes chock full of spoilers:  \n  \n- I am the opposite of upset at all the [[books/band sinister|Viscount Corvin]] treats throughout. Corvin! (Corvin, an “excellent man to be seduced by.” Corvin, his “relentless air of sexual availability.” Haaaahahaha.) Of course that’s who taught Luke what the wider, kinder world looks like. 🥹  \n  \n- Berengaria and Emily happening literally right under their oblivious doofus noses rivals even the magnificent Maisie/Phoebe lack of subtlety/oblivion in *[[books/the sugared game|Sugared Game]]* (there’s naked painting! come _on_)  \n  \n- Rufus’s reaction when he catches Luke lying and maybe cheating and stealing is everything to me, as is his eventual excitement at the truth. He’s such a scrupulously honest person, and yet his first thoughtless instincts are to, respectively, lie and bribe on Luke’s behalf, protecting him at all costs even in the midst of despair and betrayal, and then to exuberantly condone a treasure hunt. All of which in the context of things makes him more admirable, _more_ honest. That’s how to make my heart sing.  \n  \n- Once upon a time I said that _Jonathan: or The Struggles of Virtue_ is [[books/wanted a gentleman|the book-within-a-book]] I most wanted to read: its appearance here is the next best thing, in all its kinky gothic glory 🤣 \n\n- Placing the power balance in Luke’s favor, where the cocky, clever, criminal secretary has arguably (and yes, they do debate it) the upperhand on an earldom—heck yes.  \n  \n- Turning the surname Doomsday and its variations into endearments was honestly one of the things I felt the lack of in the first book. Like, how can you _not_ play with that name? I see why now, and am glad KJC saved it for this book. Each little iteration of it—_you blasted apocalypse, that pestilent Doomsday, my End of Days_—is brilliantly felt, so perfect in its context that I wanna wallow around in it like Odo in the archives (i.e. like a pig in shit). (I’m sorry, Sir Gareth, for judging you for not doing the same.)  \n\n\u003e _“You really are well named, aren’t you?

Robin and Maud, respectively, were the most difficult parts of their own books for me. They’re just so young, energetic, athletic, upstanding, so shiny, so beautiful, so aggressively… “normal,” for lack of a better word, when I prefer crankiness and weariness and a bit of tarnish on the bronze these days.\n\nHere, their presence in the ensemble was a much better balance. Enough without too much.\n\nAnd that clears the decks for Jack, deeply scarred, and Alan, deeply insolent, to take center stage. In book 2, they’re stalking around each other and scrapping like alley cats in the background, and that dynamic ratchets up a few notches here, to my endless pleasure.\n\nIt’s the best of the trilogy, by a long shot. And/or it just hit every one of my preferences in a perfect way. The kinky power dynamics vs. real world politics. The class differences. The exquisite emotional development. %%The betrayal that is immediately understood and admired.%% Crackling tension and careful tenderness.\n\nComplexity galore, [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] style. At least for the romance—the fantasy still lagged a step behind the best KJC plotting. There were some WTF turns, but ultimately I really liked where it went, and Marske wrote to her strengths. For [[books/starling house|the second book I’ve read recently]], it upends the idea of a magic system dependent on bloodlines. I thought the metaphors and parallels of imperialism came together a lot better here than in the first two books—or maybe my expectations, by now, were just more in line with what Marske delivers. \n\nEither way, it was excellent, I would read it straightaway again. Just given my tastes, I had the highest hopes for this book out of the three, but was still surprised and pleased at how well it delivered.  \n  \nA few stray notes:  \n  \n- The whole Roman storyline was utter catnip for me: concept, commentary, and execution. Best inclusion of an erotica-novel plot since *[[books/a noblemans guide to seducing a scoundrel|Jonathan: And The Struggles of Virtue]].*  \n- Actually, come to think of it, a lot of what earned the five stars for *[[books/a noblemans guide to seducing a scoundrel|Nobleman’s Guide to Seducing a Scoundrel]]* was the same kind of thing that earned high marks from me here. What can I say, I’m predictable.\n- If Marske developed the idea for Alan’s powers just so she could drop the line “Master Perturbator”… NOTHING BUT RESPECT 😆\n- All the sniping back and forth that didn’t disappear but got more pointed as they grew closer… that’s the kind of delicious bite the first books were missing.\n- “It’s alarming that forgery is your first instinct,” he said, “but I admire it.” / “If the rules are stupid, sod the rules.” (See! KJC-style is more fun for everyone.)\n- I absolutely loved the %%Robin-Adelaide marriage%%. It felt like it came out of nowhere when they announced it, but I didn’t even care, I love how that got folded right into the happy ending. See: my thoughts on the ending to *[[books/infamous|Infamous]]* too.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:37.959464704Z","tags":[]},"/books/a-restless-truth":{"title":"A Restless Truth","content":"This was so close to being great. SO CLOSE. But overall, the book felt kind of like the menagerie on board the ship, let loose in all directions, refusing to be corralled. There were some structure/plot/writing choices that left me more stumped than dazzled. Maud’s and Violet’s POV seemed really interchangeable for the first half, which is... not great when one is a supposedly scandalous, sardonic, shrewd actress and one is a sheltered, capricious, stubborn young girl.\n\nThe biggest gap in logic for me the whole time: they’re sending MAUD on this transatlantic mission of life and death importance?

I remembered some violets and the Baedeker; I missed the whole tension and tumult of a world that hasn’t found its way into new roles yet, but is on its way there.\n\nOf course it’s Italy that sparks the rebirth. Of course the last chapter is “The End of the Middle Ages.” The whole novel is like the scene of George and Freddy at the pond—dunked underwater, coming up slipping and spluttering, naked, reborn. (My kingdom for the scene of George and Freddy at the pond.)\n\nThe old mannered England is felled like a tree in the forest. It’s all new growth and wildness. Active, alive.

Miss Bartlett, ever inscrutable, who can’t be confined to her role. Freddy and George, who each reveal their different selves slowly.

But the events of 1820 have a symmetry with the events of 2020, and while it’s disingenuous to claim that’s anything new, it’s why I found myself wanting—nay, needing?—to read this series again.

Kingfisher’s aging, aching protagonists, with bad knees and big hearts and a well-honed sense of doom. The plot is a very loose retelling of The Goose Girl, minus princesses and kings and plus a conniving, murderous, sorceress mother. Evangeline, aka Doom, is determined to marry herself and her trapped, obedient daughter to the highest bidders in proper Regency-esque fashion, plans thwarted when she encounters a squire’s spinster sister who sees her for exactly who she is. There’s a coterie of women to the rescue: the no-nonsense Hester, the ruthless Imogene, the enchanting Penelope, and eventually Doom’s daughter Cordelia herself. \n\nIt’s not rah-rah feminism so much as it is changing the terms for who we deem worthy of consideration, agency, and power in these stories.

She’s willing to argue with the novel as much as we are, ready to poke holes in the perfection of this utopia—the idea of utopia at all—to allow in stinging insects and menstrual blood, men and boys who want to make war, girls who are restless with the sameness of Valley life, and grandmothers wrapped up in insane blood feuds. And don’t even get me started on the amazing audacity of creating a cassette tape of Kesh folk songs to go along with the first edition.

All we have is the Tao teh ching that is here, now. And so with translations from a literature of the (or a) future. The fact that it hasn’t yet been written, the mere absence of a text to translate, doesn’t make all that much difference.

We naturally turn towards the bookshop.”_\n\nWhere do I begin? What is this book about? Books, yes. A love of books and of libraries. Books as lifeline and language. It’s about a girl growing up, and witches and fairies and boarding schools and grief and Wales and loneliness even amongst those with whom you might belong. It’s the boundary between the real and unreal, magic and the mundane, what it means to have power and sometimes no power at all.\n\nBut what I really love about it is the in-betweenness of it all. It begins where most books would end, after a battle between good and evil which Mori has lost. (Alternately, for this book is full of alternatelys, it’s after Mori is exiled to her estranged father because her mother has gone mad and her sister has died and Mori nearly died herself.) And it ends— not with falling in love, coming of age, or finding where she belongs, but simply filling in another page.\n\nYou can see Mori’s full arc—the adult she’ll become because of the child she’s been—but it’s between the lines. She’s still stuck in between. It’s her adolescence, literally. The cusp, the not-there-yet. She meets a boy, and he’s beautiful and reads Heinlein, but he’s a friend, a right-now, not a soulmate or savior. She faces her mother at last, but it’s not redemption so much as an anticlimax. She makes an effort with her father, but it doesn’t solve their relationship. An ad-hoc [[notes/karass|karass]] still isn’t where she belongs.\n\nIt’s the experience of being fifteen. The power you may or may not have; the responsibility of it. The untrustworthy world, which seems to both hang on your actions and operate without you at all. It’s remarkably clever, this book, where the magic is simply the natural order of things. A bus on time or not; anything that can be denied.\n\nAnd I’m still describing it poorly because this is Jo Walton. It’s not a kid’s book, or a coming of age. It’s not even the science fiction or fantasy that Mori adores. It’s a story, a good one, and it plays with the concept of story itself. Books are Mori’s language. It’s how she communicates, and you see her just dying for someone to listen and then speak the same language. When they do, even imperfectly, it’s on the scale of another book’s grand revelation.\n\nI love her odd little heart. I understand the way her mind works; it’s not unlike my own. I still feel the craving for people who speak the same language, and there’s hope they exist. This is one of those books you can read all kinds of ways because you participate in the story. There are layers and layers. It gives you what you bring to it. And it’s like Mori says, if you love a book enough, the book will love you back.\n\n## Name-dropping (bibliography)\n(This list is basically an advanced starter kit for SFF, rivaling *[[books/what makes this book so great|What Makes This Book So Great]]*—or really, just literature in general)\n\n- Anne McCaffrey — *Dragonquest, Dragonflight, Dragonsinger, Dragonsong, The White Dragon*\n- J.R.R.

If that is an age you can reach, I don’t want to. I can’t even drive down the highway now without seeing something as simple as roadcuts in a whole different light.  \n  \nThis was McPhee making a study of that place where language and the earth overlap. Beyond excellent.\n\nNote: this book compiles four different previously published titles: *Basin and Range* (1981), *In Suspect Terrain* (1983), *Rising from the Plains* (1986), and *Assembling California* (1992).\n\nThis description of *Basin and Range* applies to all of it:\n\n\u003e This stretching and folding of language, by which the geologist does to words what endless eons have done to his rocks, excites Mr. McPhee to language experiments of his own. In “Basin and Range,” he is not so much a visiting amateur as a rhapsodist of “[[notes/deep time decenters the human|deep time]]” like Montaigne, who, centuries before James Hutton, celebrated the mind-stretching eons of change: “The world is but a perennial movement. All things in it are in constant motion—the earth, the rocks of the Caucasus, the pyramids of Egypt—both with the common motion and with their own. Stability itself is nothing but a more languid motion. I cannot keep my subject still. It goes along befuddled and staggering, with a natural drunkness.”\n\u003e \n\u003e Montaigne is a fitting companion for Mr. McPhee, who has the same sort of miscellaneous temperament, the same fascination with odd bits of knowledge. Whether Mr. McPhee writes about bark canoes, the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the Alaskan wilderness or now the “Big Picture” of America's geological history, he is offering us an oddly angled portrait of his own mind, an autobiography made up of shards and pieces, evoked in crisp adventurous prose. And the adventure finally is in the prose. In “Basin and Range” the perspectives and expertise of geology become a language for the drama of time. The result is a fascinating book.[^1]\n\n\n[^1]: [Rhapsodist of Deep Time, Paul Zweig, the New York Times Archives](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/books/rhapsodist-of-deep-time.html)\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:37.959464704Z","tags":[]},"/books/any-old-diamonds":{"title":"Any Old Diamonds","content":"[As KJC says](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2602050279): In which we stick it to a duke. \n\nWhat *[[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]]* was to 2018, _Any Old Diamonds_ is to 2019.

For fear, the threat is now. \n- Jealousy doesn’t seem to be a singular emotion but rather a cognitive evaluation in response to anger, sadness, and/or fear. \n- When you start to feel resentful: *what do I need but am afraid to ask for?*\n- Worst is focused on the future; rumination focuses on the past or on things things about ourselves we’re stuck on\n- Compassion is a daily practice and empathy is a skill set that is one of the most powerful tools of compassion. \n- Cognitive empathy (understanding what someone is feeling) vs. affective empathy (feeling it for them)\n- Shame and humiliation will never be effective social justice tools. \n- We have to belong to ourselves as much as we need to belong to others.\n- Any belonging that asks us to betray ourselves is not true belonging.\n- [[notes/common enemy intimacy|Hate is actually fueled for our need for belonging]]\n- Flooding (and chronic flooding)—I’ve never experienced a little time and space being a bad thing\n- “Foreboding joy,” afraid to lean into good news, wonderful moments, and joy, waiting for the other shoe to drop… most people experience it\n- Tranquility is the absence of demands and no pressure to do anything.\n- Interestingly, dominance “does not require respect or social acceptance.”\n- Narcissism is shame-based.\n- “Intellectual humility” refers specifically to a willingness to consider information that doesn’t fit with our current thinking.\n- [[notes/buddhist concept of near enemies|The Buddhist concept of near enemies]]\n- “Disembodiment often leads to an incongruence between the actions we take in the world and the beliefs that we hold.” (Prentis Hemphill)\n- “Help is the sunny side of control.” (Anne Lamott)\n- I no longer believe that we can recognize emotion in other people; too many emotions and experiences present the same way, and expressing what we’re feeling can be as unique as we are. So how do we know what people are feeling? We ask them. \n- Our emotions and experiences are layers of biology, biography, behavior, and backstory.\n- Our connection with others can only be as deep as our connection to ourselves.\n\n---\n### Pull quotes:\n\n\u003e Resentment is the feeling of frustration, judgment, anger, “better than,” and/or hidden envy related to perceived unfairness or injustice. It’s an emotion that we often experience when we fail to set boundaries or ask for what we need, or when expectations let us down because they were based on things we can’t control, like what other people think, what they feel, or how they’re going to react.\n\n\u003e I think it’s important to point out, especially in this political and social climate, that when we feel relieved, grateful, or even happy that someone who has done something hurtful, unethical, or unjust is held accountable, that’s not schadenfreude and normally doesn’t stem from counter-empathy. On the contrary, it can stem from empathy for the aggrieved. It’s similar to the distinction that when we hold someone accountable and they respond to that accountability by feeling shame, it does not mean we’ve shamed them.\n\n\u003e SPOILER ALERT: I’m pretty sure this research explains why I do not like surprises. I’m not a fan of having to manage amplified emotion while in the spotlight. But it’s not just my introversion and the spotlight piece, I don’t like surprises in movies or TV series either. I know many of y’all will find this egregious, but I normally read the entire plot of any potentially stressful movie before I watch it. People assume that ruins it for me, but it doesn’t. I can actually enjoy it better without being thrown off the surprise bridge into amplified emotion. No, thank you.\n\n\u003e “Each person’s grief is as unique as their fingerprint. But what everyone has in common is that no matter how they grieve, they share a need for their grief to be witnessed.\n\u003e That doesn’t mean needing someone to try to lessen it or reframe it for them. The need is for someone to be fully present to the magnitude of their loss without trying to point out the silver lining.” (David Kessler)\n\n\u003e Re: compassion vs. empathy: It’s an important debate that is frustratingly hijacked on occasion by folks who come up with new, arbitrary definitions for emotions that are completely different from how we all use the terms. They change the meaning, then argue that the emotion is “bad” based on their new definitions. For example, someone might say that empathy is taking on all the feelings of another person, then argue that empathy is bad. Unfortunately, this approach is often misleading and self-serving and puts no value on how we use the word. I would argue that a lot of this linguistic shell-gaming is about wanting to be contrarian. There’s nothing more seductive and clickable than a discovery that something we believe to be good is bad: “Empathy is bad for you.” (cf. *[[books/humankind|Humankind: A Hopeful History]]*?\n\n\u003e Researcher Matthew Kuan Johnson explains that people find experiences of joy difficult to articulate. He hypothesizes that the very nature of joy pushes the boundaries of our ability to communicate about lived experience via spoken language. ==He also suggests that because language can shape lived experience, cultures that have more words to describe the emotion of joy may also experience joy more richly.==\n\n\u003e “Tranquil environments” provide many restorative elements that are needed to counter mental fatigue and attention depletion. Researchers Rachel and Stephen Kaplan found that there are four essential elements of a restorative environment: a sense of getting away, a feeling of immersion, holding attention without effort, and compatibility with one’s preferences.\n\n\u003e When we lose our tolerance for vulnerability, joy becomes foreboding. No emotion is more frightening than joy, because we believe if we allow ourselves to feel joy, we are inviting disaster. We start dress-rehearsing tragedy in the best moments of our lives in order to stop vulnerability from beating us to the punch. We are terrified of being blindsided by pain, so we practice tragedy and trauma. But there’s a huge cost.\n\n\u003e Anger is a catalyst. Holding on to it will make us exhausted and sick. It’s an emotion that we need to transform into something life-giving: courage, love, change, compassion, justice.\n\u003e Or sometimes anger can mask a far more difficult emotion like grief, regret, or shame, and we need to use it to dig into what we’re really feeling. Either way, anger is a powerful catalyst but a life-sucking companion.\n\n\u003e Humility is openness to new learning combined with a balanced and accurate assessment of our contributions, including our strengths, imperfections, and opportunities for growth.\n\u003e What humility isn’t: downplaying yourself or your accomplishments, which according to researchers is modesty, not humility. It’s also not low self-esteem or meekness or letting people walk all over you.\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:37.959464704Z","tags":[]},"/books/band-sinister":{"title":"Band Sinister","content":"If this isn’t everything that’s wholesome and good in the world, I don’t know what is.

It does the thing I love where obtaining the throne is not the happy ending—it’s detrimental to the happy ending, a problem to be solved.\n- The way the stress ruins Qi Yan’s health is so much more relatable and weirdly gratifying than the superhero protagonists who sail through plots unscathed.\n- There’s an absolutely bonkers side plot where QY %%offs a lecherous prince by kidnapping the young man he’s been aggressively harassing, drugging the young man, covering him in a poison that interacts with the liquor in the prince’s system (he’s an alcoholic) and makes the prince drop dead at first kiss.%% It’s non-con as hell, but the groundwork was laid for it, it’s a two-birds-one-stone solution to a problem, and I was so far into the suspended reality of the book that I was equally impressed and appalled by the creativity. 😆\n- After the following, I’m also impressed with how grounded and intimate a lot of the biggest reveals were. I was braced for melodrama, and it just didn’t go there as often as I expected. Bonkers spy plots but then real and honest conversations, just the way I like it.\n- At one point it was about wide-scale famine and grain storage and the intricate economics of a refugee crisis and that’s the kind of stuff I’ll eat up with spoon.\n- Note: I read the translation by [@meltsmelts](https://jwqs.carrd.co/) which I think got licensed for publication when I was in the home stretch, the last 50 chapters.

Nourishment is right. I keep dipping into different pages throughout the year.  \n  \n_We are all compost for worlds we cannot yet imagine._\n\n---\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e To be alone for any length of time is to shed an outer skin. The body is inhabited in a different way when we are alone than when we are with others. Alone, we live in our bodies as a question rather than a statement.\n\n\u003e A life’s work is not a series of stepping-stones, onto which we calmly place our feet, but more like an ocean crossing where there is no path, only a heading, a direction, in conversation with the elements.\n\n\u003e Anger is the deepest form of compassion, for another, for the world, for the self, for a life, for the body, for a family and for all our ideals, all vulnerable and all, possibly about to be hurt. Stripped of physical imprisonment and violent reaction, anger is the purest form of care, the internal living flame of anger always illuminates what we belong to, what we wish to protect and what we are willing to hazard ourselves for.\n\n\u003e But anger truly felt at its center is the essential living flame of being fully alive and fully here; it is a quality to be followed to its source, to be prized, to be tended, and an invitation to finding a way to bring that source fully into the world through making the mind clearer and more generous, the heart more compassionate and the body larger and strong enough to hold it.\n\n\u003e Beauty is the harvest of presence.\n\n\u003e Taking a new step always leads to a kind of radical internal simplification, where, suddenly, very large parts of us, parts of us we have kept gainfully employed for years, parts of us still rehearsing the old complicated story, are suddenly out of a job.\n\n\u003e It is always hard to believe that the courageous step is so close to us, that it is closer than we ever could imagine, that in fact, we already know what it is, and that the step is simpler, more radical than we had thought: which is why we so often prefer the story to be more elaborate, our identities clouded by fear, the horizon safely in the distance, the essay longer than it needs to be and the answer safely in the realm of impossibility.\n\n\u003e To confess is to declare oneself ready for a more courageous road, one in which a previously defended identity might not only be shorn away, but be seen to be irrelevant, a distraction, a working delusion that kept us busy over the years and held us unaccountable to the real question.\n\n\u003e Our fears about the result of confessing are well grounded; the old identity the secret was protecting almost never survives the revelation.\n\n\u003e Courage is the measure of our heartfelt participation with life, with another, with a community, a work; a future. To be courageous is not necessarily to go anywhere or do anything except to make conscious those things we already feel deeply and then to live through the unending vulnerabilities of those consequences.\n\n\u003e Crisis is a rehearsal in fact for the act of dying, a place where inside and outside can reverse and flow with no fixed form.\n\n\u003e Denial is underestimated as a state of being.\n\n\u003e Faced with the depth of loss and disappearance in the average life, a measure of denial is creative, necessary and self-compassionate: children are not meant to know they are one day to die and older adults are not meant to tell them. Refusing to face what we are not yet ripe and ready to face can help us to live in the present.\n\n\u003e Denial is a beautiful transitional state every human being inhabits before they are emancipated into the next larger context and orphaned, often against their will, from an old and very familiar home.\n\n\u003e To live in denial is to be in very good company. ==Denial is the crossroads between perception and readiness, to deny denial is to invite powers into our lives we have not yet readied ourselves to meet.==\n\n\u003e Despair takes us in when we have nowhere else to go; when we feel the heart cannot break anymore, when our world or our loved ones disappear, when we feel we cannot be loved or do not deserve to be loved, when our God disappoints, or when our body is carrying profound pain in a way that does not seem to go away.\n\n\u003e Despair is a last protection. To disappear through despair, is to seek a temporary but necessary illusion, a place where we hope nothing can ever find us in the same way again.\n\n\u003e Despair is a necessary and seasonal state of repair, a temporary healing absence, an internal physiological and psychological winter when our previous forms of participation in the world take a rest; it is a loss of horizon, it is the place we go when we do not want to be found in the same way anymore. \n\n\u003e Despair turns to depression and abstraction when we try to make it stay beyond its appointed season and start to shape our identity around its frozen disappointments.\n\n\u003e But despair can only stay beyond its appointed time through the forced artificiality of created distance, by abstracting ourselves from bodily feeling, by trapping ourselves in the disappointed mind, by convincing ourselves that the seasons have stopped and can never turn again, and perhaps, most simply and importantly, by refusing to let the body breathe by itself, fully and deeply. Despair is kept alive by freezing our sense of time and the rhythms of time; when we no longer feel imprisoned by time, and when the season is allowed to turn, despair cannot survive.\n\n\u003e ==The antidote to despair is not to be found in the brave attempt to cheer ourselves up with happy abstracts, but in paying a profound and courageous attention to the body and the breath, independent of our imprisoning thoughts and stories, even strangely, in paying attention to despair itself, and the way we hold it, and which we realize, was never ours to own and to hold in the first place. To see and experience despair fully in our body is to begin to see it as a necessary, seasonal visitation, and the first step in letting it have its own life, neither holding it nor moving it on before its time.==\n\n\u003e We let our bodies and we let our world breathe again. In that place, strangely, despair cannot do anything but change into something else, into some other season, as it was meant to do, from the beginning.\n\n\u003e Despair is a difficult, beautiful necessary, a binding understanding between human beings caught in a fierce and difficult world where half of our experience is mediated by loss, but it is a season, [[notes/we are wiggles|a waveform passing through the body]], not a prison surrounding us. ==A season left to itself will always move, however slowly, under its own patience, power and volition.==\n\n\u003e Two people, simply by looking at the future in radically different ways have completely different futures awaiting them no matter their immediate course of action.\n\n\u003e ==We are shaped by our shaping of the world and are shaped again in turn. The way we face the world alters the face we see in the world.==\n\n\u003e Disappointment is inescapable but necessary; a misunderstood mercy and when approached properly, an agency for transformation and the hidden, underground, engine of trust and generosity in a human life. The attempt to create a life devoid of disappointment is the attempt to avoid the vulnerabilities that make the conversations of life real, moving, and life-like; it is the attempt to avoid our own necessary and merciful heartbreak.\n\n\u003e What we call disappointment may be just the first stage of our emancipation into the next greater pattern of existence.\n\n\u003e Disappointment is just the initial meeting with the frontier of an evolving life, an invitation to reality, which we expected to be one particular way and turns out to be another, often something more difficult, more overwhelming and strangely, in the end, more rewarding.\n\n\u003e It may be that the part of us that was struck and hurt can never forgive, and that strangely, forgiveness never arises from the part of us that was actually wounded.\n\n\u003e To forgive is to put oneself in a larger gravitational field of experience than the one that first seemed to hurt us. We reimagine ourselves in the light of our maturity and we reimagine the past in the light of our new identity, we allow ourselves to be gifted by a story larger than the story that first hurt us and left us bereft.\n\n\u003e At the end of life, the wish to be forgiven is ultimately the chief desire of almost every human being. In refusing to wait; in extending forgiveness to others now, we begin the long journey of becoming the person who will be large enough, able enough and generous enough to receive, at the very end, that absolution ourselves.\n\n\u003e Friendship not only helps us see ourselves through another’s eyes, but can be sustained over the years only with someone who has repeatedly forgiven us for our trespasses as we must find it in ourselves to forgive them in turn.\n\n\u003e Without tolerance and mercy all friendships die.\n\n\u003e But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self, ==the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been *seen* by someone and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.==\n\n\u003e Genius is something we already possess.\n\n\u003e Each one of us has a unique signature, inherited from our ancestors, our landscape, our language, and beneath it a half-hidden geology of existence: memories, hurts, triumphs, and stories in our lineage that have not yet been fully told.\n\n\u003e To live out our genius is to live out the conversation between our particular inherited body and the body of the world from which we seem to have been made.\n\n\u003e To stop giving in any situation is to call an end to relationship.\n\n\u003e The art often involves giving the wrong thing to the wrong person at the wrong time and learning how to do the opposite through time and trial, it means getting beyond the boundaries of our own needs, it means understanding another and another’s life, it acknowledges implicitly that we ourselves must be recipients of things we cannot often identify or even find ourselves.\n\n\u003e Little wonder then that the holiday giving that is none of these, that is automatic, chore-based, walking round the mall-based, exhausts us, debilitates us, and in the end is quite often subtly insulting to the one whom we eventually give the random item.\n\n\u003e Gratitude is the understanding that many millions of things come together and live together and mesh together and breathe together in order for us to take even one more breath of air, that the underlying gift of life and incarnation as a living, participating human being is a privilege; that we are miraculously, part of something, rather than nothing.\n\n\u003e Thanksgiving happens when our sense of presence meets all other presences. Being unappreciative might mean we are simply not paying attention.\n\n\u003e Ground is what lies beneath our feet. It is the place where we already stand; a state of recognition, the place or the circumstances to which we belong whether we wish to or not. It is what holds and supports us, but also what we do not want to be true; it is what challenges us, physically or psychologically, irrespective of our hoped for needs. It is the living, underlying foundation that tells us what we are, where we are, what season we are in and what, no matter what we wish in the abstract, is about to happen in our body, in the world or in the conversation between the two.\n\n\u003e The exorcism of an unwanted spirit is consistent the world over: an invitation to return home; for it and for us to find our way back, to cease our restless ways and to quit disturbing others’ lives or walking their houses by night.\n\n\u003e We become real by forgiving ourselves and we forgive ourselves by changing the foundational pattern, and especially by changing our present behavior to those we have hurt.\n\n\u003e A fear of ghosts, or a fear of our own haunted mind is the measure of our absence in this world. We cease to be afraid when we give away what was never ours in the first place and begin to be present to our own lives just as we find them, even in facing what we have banished from our thoughts and made homeless, even when we do not know the way forward ourselves.\n\n\u003e Heartbreak is unpreventable; the natural outcome of caring for people and things over which we have no control, of holding in our affections those who inevitably move beyond our line of sight.\n\n\u003e ==Heartbreak is how we mature; yet we use the word *heartbreak* as if it only occurs when things have gone wrong…== But heartbreak may be the very essence of being human, of being on the journey from here to there, and of coming to care deeply for what we find along the way.\n\n\u003e It may be that there may be not only no real *life* without the raw revelation of heartbreak, but no single path we can take *within* a life that will allow us to escape without having that imaginative organ we call the heart broken by what it holds and then has to let go.\n\n\u003e Heartbreak asks us not to look for an alternative path, because there is no alternative path. It is an introduction to what we love and have loved, an inescapable and often beautiful question, something and someone that has been with us all along, asking us to be ready for the ultimate letting go.\n\n\u003e We are born with an absolute necessity for help.\n\n\u003e Even the most solitary writer needs a reader, the most Machiavellian mobster a trusted lieutenant, the most independent candidate, a voter.\n\n\u003e Hiding is a way of staying alive. Hiding is a way of holding ourselves until we are ready to come into the light.\n\n\u003e Hiding is underestimated. We are hidden by life in our mother’s womb until we grow and ready ourselves for our first appearance in the lighted world; to appear too early in that world is to find ourselves with the immediate necessity for outside intensive care.\n\n\u003e ==We live in a time of the dissected soul, the immediate disclosure; our thoughts, imaginings and longings exposed to the light too much, too early and too often, our best qualities squeezed too soon into a world already awash with ideas that oppress our sense of self and our sense of others.==\n\n\u003e What is real is almost always to begin with, hidden, and does not want to be understood by the part of our mind that mistakenly thinks it knows what is happening. What is precious inside us does not care to be known by the mind in ways that diminish its presence.\n\n\u003e Hiding is an act of freedom from the misunderstanding of others, especially in the enclosing world of oppressive secret government and private entities, attempting to name us, to anticipate us, to leave us with no place to hide and grow in ways unmanaged by a creeping necessity for absolute naming, absolute tracking and absolute control.\n\n\u003e ==Hiding is a bid for independence, from others, from mistaken ideas we have about ourselves, from an oppressive and mistaken wish to keep us completely safe, completely ministered to, and therefore completely managed. Hiding is creative, necessary and beautifully subversive of outside interference and control. Hiding leaves life to itself, to become more of itself. Hiding is the radical independence necessary for our emergence into the light of a proper human future.==\n\n\u003e Every human being dwells intimately close to a door of revelation they are afraid to pass through. Honesty lies in understanding our close and necessary relationship with not wanting to hear the truth.\n\n\u003e Honesty is not found in revealing the truth, but in understanding how deeply afraid of it we are.\n\n\u003e Honesty allows us to live with not knowing. We do not know the full story, we do not know where we are in the story; we do not know who is at fault or who will carry the blame in the end.\n\n\u003e Joy can be made by practiced, hard-won achievement as much as by an unlooked for, passing act of grace arrived out of nowhere.\n\n\u003e To feel a full and untrammeled joy is to have become fully generous; to allow ourselves to be joyful is to have walked through the doorway of fear, the dropping away of the anxious worried self felt like a thankful death itself, a disappearance, a giving away, overheard in the laughter of friendship, the vulnerability of happiness felt suddenly as a strength, a solace and a source, ==the claiming of our place in the living conversation, the sheer privilege of being in the presence of a mountain, a sky or a well-loved familiar face — I was here and you were here and together we made a world.==\n\n\u003e Loneliness is the doorway to unspecified desire.\n\n\u003e In the grand scale of things, loneliness is a privilege. Human beings may have the ability to feel aloneness as no other creature can; with a power magnified by intelligence and imagination. Animals may feel alone in an instinctual way, moving naturally and affectionately toward others of their kind, but human beings may be the only beings that can articulate, imagine or call for a specific life they feel they might be missing.\n\n\u003e Loneliness is not a concept, it is the body constellating, attempting to become proximate and even join with other bodies, through physical touch, through conversation or the mediation of the intellect and the imagination.\n\n\u003e In longing we move and are moving from a known but abstracted elsewhere, to a beautiful, about to be reached, someone, something or somewhere we want to call our own.\n\n\u003e Maturity is the ability to live fully and equally in multiple contexts; most especially, the ability, despite our grief and losses, to courageously inhabit the past the present and the future all at once.\n\n\u003e Immaturity is shown by making false choices: living only in the past, or only in the present, or only in the future, or even, living only two out of the three.\n\n\u003e But maturity beckons also, asking us to be larger, more fluid, more elemental, less cornered, less unilateral, a living conversational intuition between the inherited story, the one we are privileged to inhabit and the one, if we are large enough and broad enough, moveable enough and even, *here* enough, just, astonishingly, about to occur.\n\n\u003e ==But the guru’s urge to live only in the now misunderstands the multilayered inheritance of existence, where all epochs live and breathe in parallels.==\n\n\u003e We actually inhabit memory as a living threshold, as a place of choice and volition and imagination, a crossroads where our future diverges according to how we interpret, or perhaps more accurately, how we live the story we have inherited.\n\n\u003e We might recall the ancient Greek world where *Memory* was always understood to be the mother of the muses, meaning that all of her nine imaginative daughters, all of the nine forms of human creative endeavor recognized by the ancient Greek imagination, and longed for by individuals and societies to this day, were born from the womb and the body of memory.\n\n\u003e Most of our heartbreak comes from attempting to name who or what we love and the way we love, too early in the vulnerable journey of discovery.\n\n\u003e When we demand a certain specific kind of reciprocation before the revelation has flowered completely we find ourselves disappointed and bereaved and in that grief may miss the particular form of love that is actually possible but that did not meet our initial and too specific expectations.\n\n\u003e We name mostly in order to control but what is worth loving does not want to be held within the bounds of too narrow a calling.\n\n\u003e ==Nostalgia is not an immersion in the past, nostalgia is the first annunciation that the past as we know it is coming to an end.==\n\n\u003e Pain is the doorway to the here and now.\n\n\u003e Physical or emotional pain is an ultimate form of ground, saying, to each of us, in effect, there is no other place than this place, no other body than this body, no other limb or joint or pang or sharpness or heartbreak but this searing presence. Pain asks us to heal by focusing not only on the place the pain is felt but also the actual way the pain is felt. Pain is a form of alertness and particularity; pain is a way in.\n\n\u003e Pain teaches us a fine economy, in movement, in the heart’s affections, in what we ask of ourselves and eventually in what we ask in others.\n\n\u003e In real pain we have no other choice but to learn to ask for help and on a daily basis. Pain tells us we belong and cannot live forever alone or in isolation. Pain makes us understand reciprocation.\n\n\u003e Pain is the first proper step to real compassion; it can be a foundation for understanding all those who struggle with their existence.\n\n\u003e Experiencing real pain ourselves, our moral superiority comes to an end; we stop urging others to get with the program, to get their act together or to sharpen up, and start to look for the particular form of debilitation, visible or invisible that every person struggles to overcome. ==In pain, we suddenly find our understanding and compassion engaged as to why others may find it hard to fully participate.==\n\n\u003e Pain makes drama of an everyday life with our body and our presence firmly caught on stage and in the spotlight, we are visible to others in a way over which we have no choice, limping here or leaning there.\n\n\u003e Others do not know the gift in simply being healthy, of being unconsciously free to move or walk or run. Pain is a lonely road, no one can know the measure of our particular agonies, but through pain we have the possibility, just the possibility, of coming to know others as we have, with so much difficulty, come to know ourselves.\n\n\u003e If it is difficult for anything in the real world [[notes/we are wiggles|to move in a true straight line]], think of the impossibility of two things moving together in two parallel straight lines.\n\n\u003e The great measure of human maturation is the increasing understanding that we move through life in the blink of an eye; that we are not long with the privilege of having eyes to see, ears to hear, a voice with which to speak and arms to put round a loved one; that we are simply passing through.\n\n\u003e ==The courageous life is the life that is equal to this unceasing tidal and seasonal becoming: and strangely beneath all, stillness being the only proper physical preparation for joining the breathing autonomic exchange of existence.==\n\n\u003e To see procrastination as undesirable, especially in the initial stages of an endeavor is to say that Job was procrastinating by wrestling with his angel; that a woman feeling her first birth pangs should simply get on with it; that a bud should be broken open to reveal the full glory of the flower. ==What looks from the outside like our delay; our lack of commitment; even our laziness may have more to do with a slow, necessary ripening through time and the central struggle with the realities of any endeavor to which we have set our minds.==\n\n\u003e Any creative frontier is by its nature a conversational frontier, it is a meeting of the inner and the outer worlds we inhabit, it is a knitting together, a growing together a surprising arrival with its own, to begin with, unknown unfolding, caught within it as part of its own genius.\n\n\u003e Procrastination when studied closely can be a beautiful thing, a parallel with patience, a companionable friend, a revealer of the true pattern, already caught within us; acknowledging for instance, as a writer, that before a book can be written, most of the ways it cannot be written must be tried first, in our minds; on the blank screen on the empty page or staring at the bedroom ceiling at four in the morning. Procrastination enables us to understand the true measure of our reluctance.\n\n\u003e An endeavor achieved without delay, wrong turnings, occasional blank walls and a vein of self-doubt running through all, leading eventually to some degree of heartbreak is a thing of the moment, a bagatelle, and often neither use nor ornament. It will be scanned for a moment and put aside. What is worthwhile carries the struggle of the maker written within it, but wrought into the shape of an earned understanding.\n\n\u003e Procrastination does not stop a project from coming to fruition, what stops us is giving up on an original idea because we have not got to the heart of the reason we are delaying, nor let the true form of our reluctance instruct us in the way ahead.\n\n\u003e Regret is a short, evocative and achingly beautiful word; an elegy to lost possibilities even in its brief annunciation, it is also a rarity and almost never heard except where the speaker insists that they have none, that they are brave and forward-looking and could not possibly imagine their life in any other way than the way it is.\n\n\u003e To regret fully is to appreciate how high the stakes are in even the average human life.\n\n\u003e ==Rest is the conversation between what we love to do and how we love to be.==\n\n\u003e To rest is to give up on worrying and fretting and the sense that there is something wrong with the world unless we are there to put it right; to rest is to fall back literally or figuratively from outer targets and shift the goal not to an inner static bull’s eye, an imagined state of perfect stillness, but to an inner state of natural exchange.\n\n\u003e The template of natural exchange is the breath, the autonomic giving and receiving that forms the basis and the measure of life itself.\n\n\u003e ==We are rested when we let things alone and let ourselves alone, to do what we do best, breathe as the body intended us to breathe.==\n\n\u003e Robustness and vulnerability belong together.\n\n\u003e The less contact we have with anything other than our own body, our own rhythm or the way we have arranged our life, the more afraid we can become of the frontier where actual noise, meetings and changes occur.\n\n\u003e Run away is what most human beings would like to do a great deal of the time. It is the *flight* part of the *fight or flight* deeply in our bodies and our past, it is our protection, an evolutionary momentum and a biological memory deep in the human body that allowed our ancestors to survive to another day and bequeath to us, generations later, this day. ==To want to run away is an essence of being human, it transforms any staying through the transfigurations of choice.==\n\n\u003e Strangely, we are perhaps most fully incarnated as humans, when part of us does not want to be here, or doesn’t know how to be here.\n\n\u003e To understand the part of us that wants nothing to do with the full necessities of work, of relationship, of doing what is necessary, is to learn humility, to cultivate self-compassion and to sharpen that sense of humor essential to a merciful perspective of both a self and another.\n\n\u003e In the wild, the best response to dangerous circumstances is often not to run but to assume a profoundly attentive identity, to pay attention to what seems to threaten and in that attention, not to assume the identity of the victim.\n\n\u003e Besides, there is rarely one discrete identity who needs to run. We have many different constituencies inside and out. We are not only protectors of a multilayered self but also of our family and community, of children, of those who are infirm or temporarily incapacitated, or who simply have the wrong perspective. We decide not to run not only because there are many who would be left behind who cannot run as fast as we can, but also because in turning to the source of the fear we have the possibility of finding a different way forward, a larger good, through circumstances, rather than away from them in some supposedly safe area where threats no longer occur.\n\n\u003e Self-knowledge is not fully possible for human beings. We do not reside in a body, a mind or a world where it is achievable or from the point of being interesting, even desirable. Half of what lies in the heart and mind is potentiality; resides in the darkness of the unspoken and unarticulated and has not yet come into being: this hidden unspoken half of a person will supplant and subvert any present understandings we have about ourselves.\n\n\u003e Human beings are always, and always will be, a frontier between what is known and what is not known.\n\n\u003e ==What we are actually about to become or are afraid of becoming always trumps and rules over what we think we are already.==\n\n\u003e The hope that a human being can achieve complete honesty and self-knowledge with regard to themselves is a fiction and a chimera, the jargon and goals of a corporate educational system brought to bear on the depths of an identity where the writ of organizing language does not run. Self-knowledge includes the understanding that the self we want to know is about to disappear. What we can understand is the way we occupy this frontier between the known and the unknown, the way we hold the conversation of life, the figure we cut at that edge, ==but a detailed audit of the self is not possible and diminishes us in the attempt to establish it; we are made on a grander scale, half afraid of ourselves, half in love with immensities beyond any name we can give.==\n\n\u003e What we recognize and applaud as honesty and transparency in an individual is actually the humble demeanor of the apprentice, someone paying extreme attention, to themselves, to others, to life, to the next step, which they may survive or they may not; ==someone who does not have all the answers but who is attempting to learn what they can, about themselves and those with whom they share the journey, someone like everyone else, wondering what they and their society are about to turn into.==\n\n\u003e To change the shape of ourselves is to change the shape of the shadow we cast. To become transparent is to lose one’s shadow altogether, something we often desire in the spiritual abstract, but actually something that is not attainable by human beings — to change the shape of the identity that casts a shadow is more possible. Shadow is a necessary consequence of being in a sunlit visible world, but it is not a central identity, or a power waiting to overwhelm us.\n\n\u003e Mythologically, having no shadow means being of another world, not being fully human, not being in or of this world.\n\n\u003e To feel shy is to look five ways at once: to the beckoning new life in front of us, to the line of retreat behind us, to alternative possibilities of escape to left and right, and in really difficult circumstances, the hope for a complete and sudden disappearance.\n\n\u003e Shyness is underestimated and neglected as a way of being when first approaching the new, the necessary and the overwhelming.\n\n\u003e Our visual media, especially television, tells us that shyness is unnecessary and thus corrupts our sense of what constitutes a real exploration. Likewise, in our virtual travels we rarely meet many beautiful representations of shyness through social media, but physical shyness tells us through our very vulnerability, that we are at last in the presence of the mystery, of some thing, some place, or some one we deeply desire or that represents what we desire, though we do not as yet, in our essential physical helplessness, know how to bring it about.\n\n\u003e Total confidence at the beginning of a new phase of life means we are misinformed, that we are deeply mistaken, that we think we know what is about to occur and who we are about to become. Shyness is an invitation to a particular form of beauty, to qualities that are meant to be both practiced and cultivated; shyness is our friend; the annunciation that we are just about to walk through the door and through all our difficulties, attempt another beginning.\n\n\u003e Real silence puts any present understanding to shame; orphans us from certainty; leads us beyond the well-known and accepted reality and confronts us with the unknown and previously unacceptable conversation about to break in upon our lives.\n\n\u003e ==To become deeply silent is not to become still, but to become tidal and seasonal, a coming and going that has its own inimitable, essential character, a story not fully told, like the background of the sea, or the rain falling or the river going on, out of sight, out of our lives.==\n\n\u003e Solace is what we must look for when the mind cannot bear the pain, the loss or the suffering that eventually touches every life and every endeavor; when longing does not come to fruition in a form we can recognize, when people we know and love disappear, when hope must take a different form than the one we have shaped for it.\n\n\u003e Solace is the beautiful, imaginative home we make where disappointment can go to be rehabilitated. When life does not in any way add up, we must turn to the part of us that has never wanted a life of simple calculation.\n\n\u003e Solace is not an evasion, nor a cure for our suffering, nor a made up state of mind. Solace is a direct seeing and participation; a celebration of the beautiful coming and going, appearance and disappearance of which we have always been a part.\n\n\u003e To look for solace is to learn to ask fiercer and more exquisitely pointed questions, questions that reshape our identities and our bodies and our relation to others.\n\n\u003e But solace also asks us very direct and forceful questions. Firstly, how will you bear the inevitable that is coming to you? And how will you endure it through the years? And above all, how will you shape a life equal to and as beautiful and as astonishing as a world that can birth you, bring you into the light and then just as you are beginning to understand it, take you away?\n\n\u003e We are something for the world to run up against and rub up against: through the trials of love, through pain, through happiness, through our simple everyday movement through the world.\n\n\u003e In the ancient world the touch of a God was seen as both a blessing and a violation — at one and the same time. Being alive in the world means being found by that world and sometimes touched to the core in ways we would rather not experience.\n\n\u003e To forge an untouchable, invulnerable identity is actually a sign of retreat from this world; of weakness, a sign of fear rather than strength and betrays a strange misunderstanding of an abiding, foundational and necessary reality: that untouched, we disappear.\n\n\u003e Unconditional love is not fully possible. We are mortal creatures of living and dying and how we love and what we love is conditional upon where we stand in the drama and the seasonality of that living and dying. Love may be sanctified and ennobled by its commitment to the unconditional horizon of perfection, but what makes love real in the human world seems to be our moving, struggling conversation with that wanted horizon rather than any possibility of arrival.\n\n\u003e The hope for, or the declaration of a purely spiritual, unconditional love is more often a coded desire for immunity and safety, an attempt to forgo the trials of vulnerability, powerlessness and the exquisite pain to which we apprentice ourselves in a relationship, a marriage, in raising children, in a work we love and desire.\n\n\u003e The invitation is made to us every day whether we desire it or no, to enter a deeply human world of robust vulnerability, shot through with a sometimes joyful, more often difficult helplessness, to risk ourselves in the conditional world in which we live and to accept that there is no possible path we can follow where we will be untouched by the heartbreak, the difficulties and the joys that move us and move through us, under the beautiful and beautifully conditional guise of love.\n\n\u003e Whether our affections are caught in romantic love, trying to see our neighbors as ourselves or trying to love a great but distant God, our love rarely seems to be returned in the mode that it is given.\n\n\u003e Human beings live in disappointment and a self-appointed imprisonment when they refuse to love unless they are loved the selfsame way in return.\n\n\u003e Vulnerability is not a choice, vulnerability is the underlying, ever present and abiding undercurrent of our natural state.\n\n\u003e More seriously, in refusing our vulnerability we refuse the help needed at every turn of our existence and immobilize the essential, tidal and conversational foundations of our identity.\n\n\u003e The only choice we have as we mature is how we inhabit our vulnerability, how we become larger and more courageous and more compassionate through our intimacy with disappearance.\n\n\u003e Withdrawal can be the very best way of stepping forward and done well, a beautiful freeing act of mercy and as an art form, underestimated in this time of constant action and engagement.\n\n\u003e We stick to the wrong thing quite often, not because it will come to fruition by further effort, but because we cannot let go of the way we have decided to tell the story and we become further enmeshed even by trying to make sense of what entraps us, when what is needed is a simple, clean breaking away.\n\n\u003e To remove ourselves entirely and absolutely, abruptly and at times un-compromisingly is often the real and radically courageous break for freedom. …We start the process of losing our false enemies, and even our false friends, and most especially the false sense of self we have manufactured to live with them: we make ourselves available for the simple purification of seeing ourselves and our world more elementally and therefore more clearly again.\n\n\u003e ==We withdraw not to disappear, but to find another ground from which to see; a solid ground from which to step, and from which to speak again, in a different way, a clear, rested, embodied voice, our life as a suddenly emphatic statement and one from which we do not wish to withdraw.==\n\n\u003e Work, among all its abstracts, is actually intimacy, the place where the self meets the world.\n\n\u003e To reduce work in our societal imagination merely to competition, and to the act of beating the competition, is to condemn our societies, our communities and our individual lives to imaginative poverty of the very worst kind.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.035464964Z","tags":[]},"/books/content":{"title":"Content","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.035464964Z","tags":[]},"/books/conversion":{"title":"Conversion","content":"A 12th century missionary finds shelter in a blizzard with a gruff, kindhearted hermit.

It goes the predictable contemporary romance route, dual POVs that reduce Knightley and Emma to a horny executive and a snobbish socialite. Gone is the communal voice, the class friction, the tapestry of complex characters with rich inner lives of their own, propelled by the roles society forces them to inhabit, who can’t be reduced to stereotypes like “country bumpkin” or “sleazy misogynist.” Instead of trenchant social commentary, we get fashion designers namedropped like glitter and the LA offices of Knightley Capital.

The stories are brief and vertiginous, mind-boggling and often cheeky. An undisputed masterpiece, even if I’m still partial to [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]], even if Calvino himself would disagree with me (per his essay on Borges in *[[books/six memos for the next millennium|Six Memos for the Next Millennium]]*).\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e History, *mother* of truth; the idea is astounding. Menard, a contemporary of William James, does not define history as an investigation of reality, but as its origin. Historical truth, for him, is not what took place; it is what we think took place. (“Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote”)\n\n\u003e It was from this initial bravado of a few men that the all-powerful position of the Company—its ecclesiastical, metaphysical strength—was derived. (“The Babylon Lottery”)\n\n\u003e In any case, there is nothing so contaminated with fiction as the history of the Company… (“The Babylon Lottery”)\n\n\u003e This silent functioning, comparable to that of God, gives rise to all manner of conjectures. One of them, for instance, abominably insinuates that the Company is eternal and that it will last until the last night of the world, when the last god annihilates the cosmos. Still another conjecture declares that the Company is omnipotent, but that it exerts its influence only in the most minute matters: in a bird's cry, in the shades of rust and the hues of dust, in the cat naps of dawn. There is one conjecture, spoken from the mouths of masked heresiarchs, to the effect that the Company has never existed and never will. A conjecture no less vile argues that it is indifferently inconsequential to affirm or deny the reality of the shadowy corporation, because Babylon is nothing but an infinite game of chance. (“The Babylon Lottery”)\n\n\u003e Flaubert and Henry James have accustomed us to suppose that works of art are infrequent and laboriously composed. The sixteenth century (we need only recall Cervantes’ *Viaje al Parnaso*, or Shakespeare’s destiny) did not share this disconsolate opinion. Neither did Herbert Quain. He thought that good literature was common enough, that there is scarce a dialogue in the street which does not achieve it. (“An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain”)\n\n\u003e You who read me, are you sure you understand my language? (“Library of Babel”)\n\n\u003e I foresee that man will resign himself each day to new abominations, that soon only soldiers and bandits will be left. To them I offer this advice: *Whosoever would undertake some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished, should impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.* (“The Garden of Forking Paths”)\n\n\u003e “The explanation is obvious. *The Garden of Forking Paths* is a picture, incomplete yet not false, of the universe such as Ts’ui Pên conceived it to be. Differing from Newton and Schopenhauer, your ancestor did not think of time as absolute and uniform. He believed in an infinite series of times, in a dizzily growing, ever spreading network of diverging, converging and parallel times. This web of time—the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect or ignore each other through the centuries—embraces *every* possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist. In this one, in which chance has favored me, you have come to my gate. In another, you, crossing the garden, have found me dead. In yet another, I say these very same words, but am an error, a phantom.” (“The Garden of Forking Paths”)\n\n\u003e [[authors/john locke|Locke]], in the seventeenth century, postulated (and rejected) an impossible idiom in which each individual object, each stone, each bird and branch had an individual name; Funes had once projected an analogous idiom, but he had renounced it as being too general, too ambiguous. In effect, Funes not only remembered every leaf on every tree of every wood, but even every one of the times he had perceived or imagined it. (“Funes, the Memorious”)\n\n\u003e The reasons that one man may have to abominate another, or love him, are infinite: Moon reduced universal history to a sordid economic conflict. (“The Form of the Sword”)\n\n\u003e That history should have imitated history was already sufficiently marvelous; that history should imitate literature is inconceivable… (“Theme of the Traitor and the Hero”)\n\n\u003e Someone may observe that no doubt the conclusion preceded the “proofs.” For who gives himself up to looking for proofs of something he does not believe in or the predication of which he does not care about? (“Three Versions of Judas”)\n\n\u003e The truth was that Dahlmann read very little. The magnetized mountain and the genie who swore to kill his benefactor are—who would deny it?—marvelous, but not so much more than the morning itself and the mere fact of being. The joy of life distracted him from paying attention to Scheherezade and her superfluous miracles. Dahlmann closed his book and allowed himself to live.

For many people, I imagine “radical” is the word in the title that lifts eyebrows; for me, it’s the word “secret.” Austen’s politics have always felt clear on the page, and this is how I’ve read her, even lacking some of the well-researched context Helena Kelly provides here. \n\nI understand romance readers, myself included, who get tetchy at the suggestion that the romance genre is inferior, and a book must earn in its way into the canon by being Serious and Important. But I also stand by my conviction that Jane Austen wrote only one romance—*[[books/pride and prejudice|Pride and Prejudice]]*—and had to warp all societal conventions to do it, and it’s important to understand why. She is first and foremost a political writer to me, and however you read her endings, the domestic *is* political, who we’re permitted or forbidden to love *is* political. When Kelly agrees that Austen deserves to be in the same conversation as [[authors/mary wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraft]] or Thomas Paine, I cheer. \n\n---\n\n## Pull quotes\n\nThe general quotes are below; the quotes that apply specifically to the context of the novels are listed with each novel: *[[books/sense and sensibility|Sense and Sensibility]], [[books/pride and prejudice|Pride and Prejudice]], [[books/mansfield park|Mansfield Park]], [[books/emma|Emma]], [[books/northanger abbey|Northanger Abbey]], [[books/persuasion|Persuasion]].*\n\n\u003e We’re perfectly willing to accept that writers like Wordsworth were fully engaged with everything that was happening and to find the references in their work, even when they’re veiled or allusive. But we haven’t been willing to do it with Jane’s work. We know Jane; we know that however delicate her touch she’s essentially writing variations of the same plot, a plot that wouldn’t be out of place in any romantic comedy of the last two centuries.\n\u003e \n\u003e We know wrong.\n\n\u003e Saddled with a monarch who was periodically insane, and an heir to the throne who was not only dissolute and expensive to run but had also illegally married a Catholic widow, the British state was under enormous strain even before the war with France began. The war, for many years, went badly for Britain. French armies marched through Europe; French ships menaced Britain’s trade; the fear of invasion was constant. People who criticized the behavior of the royal family, or complained about corrupt parliamentary elections, who turned away from the Church of England or asked whether those in power should really keep it, were perceived as betraying their country in its hour of need. To question one aspect of the way society worked was to attempt to undermine the whole.\n\n\u003e In the process, Britain began to look more and more like a totalitarian state, with the unpleasant habits that totalitarian states acquire. Habeas corpus—the centuries-old requirement that any detention be publicly justified—was suspended. Treason was redefined. It was no longer limited to actively conspiring to overthrow and to kill; it included thinking, writing, printing, reading.\n\n\u003e It’s impossible for anyone to write thousands upon thousands of words and reveal nothing of how she thinks or what she believes. And, contrary to popular opinion, Jane did reveal her beliefs, not just about domestic life and relationships, but about the wider political and social issues of the day.\n\n\u003e But when she was writing, she was anticipating that her readers would understand how to read between the lines, how to mine her books for meaning, just as readers in Communist states learned how to read what writers had to learn how to write. Jane’s novels were produced in a state that was, essentially, totalitarian. She had to write with that in mind. The trick was never to be too explicit, too obvious, never to have a sentence or a paragraph to which someone could point and say, “Look, there—it’s there you criticize the state, it’s there you say that marriage traps women, that the Church is crammed with hypocrites, that you promote breaking society’s rules.”\n\n\u003e *[[books/mansfield park|Mansfield Park]]*, alone of all her books, wasn’t reviewed on publication. This, as I will show, is because it was an inescapably political novel, from the title onward—a “fanatical novel” that continually forced its readers to confront the Church of England’s complicity in slavery.\n\n\u003e Jane talks in one letter about wanting readers who have “a great deal of ingenuity,” who will read her carefully. In wartime, in a totalitarian regime, and in a culture that took the written word far more seriously than we do, she could have expected to find them. Jane expected to be read slowly—perhaps aloud, in the evenings, or over a period of weeks as each volume was borrowed in turn from the circulating library. She expected that her readers would think about what she wrote, would even discuss it with each other.\n\u003e \n\u003e She never expected to be read the way we read her, gulped down as escapist historical fiction, fodder for romantic fantasies. Yes, she wanted to be enjoyed; she wanted people to feel as strongly about her characters as she did herself. But for Jane a story about love and marriage wasn’t ever a light and frothy confection.\n\n\u003e The four of her brothers who became fathers produced, between them, thirty-three children. Three of those brothers lost a wife to complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Another of Jane’s sisters-in-law collapsed and died suddenly at the age of thirty-six; it sounds very much as if the cause might have been the rupturing of an ectopic pregnancy, which was, then, impossible to treat.\n\n\u003e Jane’s novels aren’t romantic. But it’s become increasingly difficult for readers to see this.\n\n\u003e It’s hard; it requires an effort for most readers to blink those images away, to be able to see Edward Ferrars cutting up a scissor case (a scene that arguably carries a strong suggestion of sexual violence) rather than the 1990s heartthrob Hugh Grant nervously rearranging the china ornaments on the mantelpiece. By the time you’ve seen Colin-Firth-as-Mr.-Darcy poised to dive into a lake fifty times, it’s made a synaptic pathway in your brain. Indeed, I’d question whether we can get away from that, certainly how we do.\n\n\u003e And this ought to concern us, because a lot of the images—like the images on the banknote—are simplistic, and some of them are plain wrong. Pemberley isn’t on the scale of the great ducal mansion at Chatsworth; Captain Wentworth doesn’t buy Kellynch Hall for Anne as a wedding present at the end of *[[books/persuasion|Persuasion]]*; the environs of Highbury, the setting for *[[books/emma|Emma]]*, aren’t a golden pastoral idyll. We have, really, very little reason to believe that Jane was in love with Tom Lefroy. But each image colors our understanding in some way or another, from Henry Austen’s careful portrait of his sister as an accidental author to Curtis Sittenfeld’s updated *Pride and Prejudice,* set in suburban Cincinnati.\n\u003e \n\u003e The effect of all of them together is to make us read novels that aren’t actually there.\n\n\u003e Jane’s novels, in truth, are as revolutionary, at their heart, as anything that Wollstonecraft or Tom Paine wrote. But by and large, they’re so cleverly crafted that unless readers are looking in the right places—reading them in the right way—they simply won’t understand.\n\n\u003e Jane wasn’t a genius—inspired, unthinking; she was an artist. She compared herself to a miniature painter; in her work every stroke of the brush, every word, every character name and every line of poetry quoted, every location, matters.\n\n\u003e *[[books/northanger abbey|Northanger Abbey]]* contains a lengthy passage about history, about its blend of fact and fiction. The naive heroine, Catherine Morland, states an undoubted truth, that “a great deal” of history is made up: “The speeches that are put into the heroes’ mouths, their thoughts and designs—the chief of all this must be invention.” The older and more intelligent Eleanor Tilney, who reads history chiefly for pleasure, expresses herself “very well contented to take the false with the true.” For Jane herself, though, fiction isn’t simply an enjoyable embellishment. It can offer deeper truths than fact. It’s in fiction, Jane says, that we should look for “the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties.”\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/jane-eyre":{"title":"Jane Eyre","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/jesus-apocalyptic-prophet-of-the-new-millennium":{"title":"Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium","content":"What I wanted *[[books/zealot|Zealot]]* to be.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/juliette":{"title":"Juliette","content":"I rarely do this, but there’s [another review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/189217747) that says it so well, I’m going to quote it instead of trying to sum up my own thoughts:\n\n\u003e Sade the philosopher is in force, and his treatises — like his other novels delivered by key characters — are interspersed with the sex and violence one expects. And yet…is it Sade who speaks through his canon’s most libertine characters, or is he an ironist an order of magnitude more accomplished than Swift? I recommend a brief familiarity with his biography and political beliefs, and probably reading his Philosophy in the Bedroom, before reading Juliette. When a reader falls in stride with Sade, and any prudish shock wears off, it becomes easier to discern what’s true to his idealistic vision of humanity, what’s buffoonery, and what are prescient satirical riffs and exposés of the cultural idiosyncrasies he endured in eighteenth-century France. Otherwise Sade can appear to be a mass of contradictions. He respects the state and the institution of democracy yet rejects law. His characters expound on their superiority over other living things yet he writes brilliantly on the equality of animals and humans. And so on.\n\nAgreed. Read [[books/justine philosophy in the bedroom and other writings|Philosophy in the Bedroom]] first, acquaint yourself with Sade the philosopher instead of Sade the grotesque distortion, and proceed accordingly.  \n\nThe one thing I’d argue is that instead of only _appearing_ to be a mass of contradictions, he _is_ a mass of contradictions, intentionally, provocatively, profoundly. [[books/justine philosophy in the bedroom and other writings|As I said before]], I get the feeling he very pointedly and gleefully contradicts himself, over and over, just to get readers to _think_. Don’t take it all as read, even what he’s saying. Think you get his point?

I had my suspicions about Sade, that more was going on than just some shock and awe erotica, and in _[[books/too like the lightning|Too Like The Lightning]],_ when he becomes part of the dialogue in a key way, she makes it clear that to read Sade as sadism is too narrow a view. I had to go to the source to confirm it, and confirm it I have.\n\n\u003e “I am about to put forward some major ideas; they will be heard and pondered. If not all of them please, surely a few will; in some sort, then, I shall have contributed to the progress of our age, and shall be content.” (from “Yet Another Effort, Frenchmen, If You Would Become Republicans”)\n\nSade wants you to _think._ It’s all to a point—one that kept him imprisoned for much of his life. He’s in dialogue with his peers. He’s parodying 18th century scientific logic. He’s invoking taboo because, as Palmer would put it, that’s the Enlightenment art: mixing forbidden sex acts with forbidden things, especially forbidden talk.\n\nContext is everything. And Sade, within context, isn’t a beast who’s willing to file down his teeth. His pornography is _ideas_—scathing, provoking, often remarkably funny, terribly, boldly uncensored ideas. About God. Philosophy. Crime and punishment. Sexuality. Morality. On and on. There isn’t an extreme he won’t push. I get the feeling he gleefully contradicts himself, intentionally, again, just to get readers to _think_. Don’t take it all as read, even what he’s saying. Think you get his point? Wrong again, think some more.\n\nHe’s a piece of a larger puzzle, and I would argue a crucial one. All these centuries later, he has refused to die, and it’s worth listening to what he has to say, if only to see where we might still be blind.\n\n\u003e _Sade warns that he who would use Reason as a key to open one door opens many, and he who would make Reason a scythe to fell injustices must beware what else the blade might cut._ (*[[books/too like the lightning|Too Like the Lightning]]*)\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e Voltaire’s version of man may explain how humankind came to invent the spade; Jean-Jacques’, the hayloft; Diderot’s, conversation. But ogres and inquisitions and wars? \n\u003e \n\u003e “Eh,” replies Voltaire, “those poor people were mad. We shall correct all that.” \n\u003e \n\u003e “That is exactly what I call cheating,” rejoins Sade; “we set out to understand man, and before we have even begun you are already trying to change him.”\n\n\u003e “My neighbors’ passions frighten me infinitely less than do the law’s injustices, for my neighbors’ passions are contained by mine, whilst nothing constrains, nothing checks the injustices of the law.”\n\n\u003e In a sense, this was one of Sade’s ambitions: to be innocent by dint of culpability; to smash what is normal, once and for all, and smash the laws by which he could have been judged.\n\n\u003e “But, unfortunately, I was in the clutches of a flock of imbeciles who always use fetters for arguments and bigotry instead of philosophy, and that for the great good reason that it is always much easier to impound than to ponder and to pray to God than to be useful to mankind. In the one case some virtues are required; only hypocrisy is required in the other.”\n\n\u003e “It is not to them I speak; I address myself only to people capable of hearing me out, and they will read me without any danger.” (this makes me think of Jane Austen’s [[private/dull elves|dull elves]])\n\n\u003e “We wonder that savagery could ever reach the point where you condemn to death an unhappy person all of whose crime amounts to not sharing your tastes.”\n\n\u003e “A little more philosophy in the world would soon restore all to order and would cause magistrates and legislators to see that the crimes they condemn and punish with such rigor sometimes have a far greater degree of utility than those virtues they preach without practicing and without ever rewarding.”","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/kalpa-imperial":{"title":"Kalpa Imperial","content":"Exquisite.

That grounds the absolutely bonkers story going on around it, where there’s a blizzard and a castle in Scotland and organized crime and bodies dropping like flies, and a supporting cast straight out of Clue. (Spotting those shoutouts throughout the book was a treat.)  \n  \nYou can take your pick of what book you want out of this: a gothic Christie-esque mystery, a be-gay-solve-crimes murderino podcast in book form (the main character Liza is the host of just such a podcast), a madcap homage to Clue, or the lowkey romance of two lovers rekindling their relationship.

Instead, he spoke for an alternative school of Darwinism that emerged in Russia, emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change.\n\nNote: it’s fitting that this edition has an introduction by [[authors/david graeber|David Graeber]], because I came across it in the first place due to Graeber’s quote below: \n\n\u003e Kropotkin’s actual argument is far more interesting. Much of it, for instance, is concerned with how animal cooperation often has nothing to do with survival or reproduction, but is a form of pleasure in itself. “To take flight in flocks merely for pleasure is quite common among all sorts of birds,” he writes. Kropotkin multiplies examples of social play: pairs of vultures wheeling about for their own entertainment, hares so keen to box with other species that they occasionally (and unwisely) approach foxes, flocks of birds performing military-style maneuvers, bands of squirrels coming together for wrestling and similar games…\n\nLife is an end in itself, etc. \n\n[^1]: David Graeber, [[notes/what's the point if we can't have fun|What's the point if we can't have fun?]]","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/my-seditious-heart":{"title":"My Seditious Heart","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/nettle-and-bone":{"title":"Nettle \u0026 Bone","content":"So this is everything a fairy tale should be.

Chomsky and Pappé cut through the murk of propaganda and politic with much-needed clarity.

I’m glad this one found an indie publisher, although in my dreams it’s one with enough in the budget (ha!) to bring the comic book chapters to life. Akin to *[[books/blackouts|Blackouts]]*, it’s a collage of a novel, interspersed with letters and academic journals and emails and interviews, not to mention the entire comic book that Peter and Tai create as they go. Capturing that visually would make a compelling book.\n\nBut oh yes—the story. Peter, a social worker in 1990’s NYC, comes of age in his late 20’s, dealing with childhood abuse while navigating a relationship with his boyfriend Julian, who’s escaping family demons of his own, widowed by the loss of his first love to HIV. Collaborating with Tai (/Tyler), a kickass genderfluid teen, Peter starts to write his way back through his memories, exorcising the most painful parts of his past in comic book form. There’s a whole chorus of characters who all get a voice: an HIV-positive teacher who’s trying to adopt a child with his husband; a Christian bodybuilder/political bodyman who’s the “successful” product of conversion therapy; a model-turned-mystical-guru of the self-help set; Peter’s marvelous and plain-speaking half-sister Prue… and on and on. Steeped in nerd culture, and a celebration of queer culture in the midst of the AIDS apocalypse, there’s more joy and kink and friendship and healing than the heavier description of trauma would imply.\n\nOne thorny part is that various people on page ascribe Peter’s kinkiness to the childhood incest, much like homosexuality would have been ascribed to that a generation before. That’s pretty faithful to the characters and the time period, especially with the specter of AIDS and unsafe sex, but while in every other way I appreciated the 1990’s verisimilitude of it all—not 1990’s through the lens and vocabulary of 2024—I still yearned for a little glimpse of authorial pushback on that assumption. Thankfully though, it’s indicated near the end that it’s not really Peter “healing” from his kink so much as it is Julian meeting him halfway and embracing his own kinkiness, safely. There’s also a *smidge* of Zionism, which feels true to the Ashkenazi Jewish character(s) it comes from, but sticks out painfully with the current genocide in Palestine.\n\nAll in all, a complex book of messy characters that was worth the read. Well done, Jendi Reiter.\n\n*ARC kindly provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/orlando":{"title":"Orlando","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/orlando-furioso":{"title":"Orlando Furioso","content":"A note on translation: I used Reynolds to compare, contrast, and fill in the gaps with the [[books/orlando furioso a new verse translation|Slavitt translation]].

When the war resumed in 1803, she was trapped on the wrong side of the Channel, remaining there for the next ten years. She didn’t return to England until shortly before the publication of her final novel, The Wanderer, in 1814—a novel that sold poorly. For a reader of 1816 or 1817, Burney’s name would have had a very different meaning from the one it had held a decade or more earlier.\n\n\u003e It’s the first version of Belinda that Jane holds up as an example of the greatness of the novel, not the second, censored version. Her literary references had taken on a different meaning; they no longer read as she’d originally intended.\n\n\u003e Jane makes a particular point of not taking us into the bedrooms of married women. She ventures in there on only two occasions. One is the brief scene in Persuasion when the unconscious Louisa Musgrove, the apparent current love interest of the heroine’s former fiancé, is carried to the bed of his naval friends Captain and Mrs. Harville. But this doesn’t really count, because Louisa is seriously ill, having given herself a concussion by misjudging a jump off the stone harbor at Lyme. The other occasion—the one that stands out—is in Northanger Abbey when Catherine becomes obsessed with the idea of getting into the bedroom that belonged to the dead Mrs. Tilney—Henry’s mother, seldom mentioned.\n\n\u003e But English culture in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries wasn’t all that prudish either. It was sexist and morally judgmental, absolutely, but in other respects it was far more relaxed about bodies than we are. You find advertisements for nipple cream in early nineteenth-century newspapers.\n\n\u003e There’s a matter-of-factness here about sex and its dangers and about the physical toll that childbirth takes on the female body, an awareness, a respect, almost, that in some ways we’ve lost. It was generally accepted that pregnancy and giving birth weren’t unalloyed pleasures for women; in fact the eighteenth century saw quite a lot of research and development into surgical devices designed specifically to correct anal and vaginal prolapse. All of this perhaps goes some way toward explaining why, for the first two-thirds of Jane’s life, abortion was perfectly legal.\n\n\u003e The culture Jane had grown up in didn’t require women to be always joyously accepting of pregnancy.\n\n\u003e Postpartum hemorrhage, sepsis—they were very likely to kill you. And there were complications of pregnancy to be considered as well. Ectopic pregnancy was inevitably fatal. In 1855, the novelist [[authors/charlotte brontë|Charlotte Brontë]] died from what was very probably hyperemesis—the violent, unrelenting nausea and vomiting that the current Duchess of Cambridge has suffered from in both her pregnancies. The only treatment for eclampsia was to deliver the baby (this remained the sole treatment until 1957). Cesarean section was very rarely used; surgeons weren’t skilled in it. In the pre-hygiene era, it amounted to a death sentence for the mother anyway.\n\n\u003e It’s odd. We know that this isn’t how Jane saw the matter and that it isn’t an accurate representation of childbirth at the time. And it’s particularly odd in fiction. Novels of the period almost always made their heroes and heroines orphans, or apparently orphans. Tragic deaths in childbirth happened all the time in books.\n\u003e \n\u003e Jane even jokes about it, at the very beginning of *Northanger Abbey*, saying how “remarkable” it is that her heroine’s mother should possess such a “good constitution,” how unexpected that rather than dying having Catherine, Mrs. Morland has “lived on to have six children more” and “see them growing up around her.” It’s part of the fun Jane has in the opening chapters, skewering every novelistic convention she can think of.\n\n\u003e Just as we, hearing of the sudden death of a young or youngish woman, default to ideas of a car crash or cancer, so Jane’s readers would guess at childbirth as a cause of death before anything else, for married women at least.\n\n\u003e As we’ve seen, though, Jane surely hoped—she surely intended, when she wrote it—for her readers to find something different and altogether more complicated in the novel. Jane assumed, when she was writing the book, that her readers would know certain novels and plays, would read certain references into the text. This is what she’s talking about, in the advertisement. She expected, originally, readers who were familiar enough with gothic novels to realize what’s passed nearly every modern reader by—the fact that Catherine Morland, probably the best-known gothic novel reader in the world, reads only one gothic novel and doesn’t even seem to finish it.\n\n\u003e Isabella, it’s clear, hasn’t read any of these novels herself; she’s going on the recommendation of her “particular friend” Miss Andrews, who has “read every one of them.” Not reading is quite a theme in this most self-consciously bookish of Jane’s novels.\n\n\u003e What Jane’s trying to do here, it seems to me, is to keep Catherine trapped in a state of suspense that her own readers never have to share. Jane’s readers, if they’ve read *Udolpho* properly, to the end, ought to be able to pick out all the references and in-jokes that pass Catherine by so completely.\n\n\u003e All of this leads us to the rather odd conclusion that Catherine, at Northanger, is acting out parts of *Udolpho*, slipping from one role to another, but—apparently—without being aware of what she’s doing.\n\n\u003e It’s not even entirely clear that we’re in Catherine’s mind at this point; the voice of the narrator is more intrusive in Northanger than it is in Jane’s later novels, and far less deftly deployed.\n\n\u003e Jane has gone to quite a lot of trouble to suggest that Catherine either hasn’t read more than half a gothic novel or, if she has, has read it with such a breathtaking lack of attention that she might as well not have bothered.\n\n\u003e What Jane is trying to show with Catherine, I would suggest, is a reader who doesn’t read properly, who brings her own preconceptions and expectations to the text, who blames the author for the ideas she’s gained from an incomplete, inattentive reading. Jane doesn’t intend to “desert” her sister authoress Radcliffe, to expose her to ridicule. She’s attempting to do the opposite. (nb: ironic that this is now Jane’s dilemma!)\n\n\u003e Catherine, who, we’re told, learned it “as quickly as any girl in England.” The Beggar’s Petition, though, is, to the modern mind, a very odd choice of reading (and of learning by heart) for a small child. It deals with uncomfortable subjects: war, enclosure, abuse of power, the kinds of subjects that—wrongly—we consider distant from Jane’s novels.\n\n\u003e Catherine’s “indulgence” in *Udolpho* is only the match to a pile of literary and cultural fuel; what burns, what drives her behavior, are half-remembered episodes from English history, Shakespeare’s plays, anti-Catholicism. The chest and cabinet she nerves herself to throw open, searching for secrets, glance toward the novel in which William Godwin—perhaps the most radical of the 1790s radicals—laid bare the state of “things as they are.” There are stronger, more deeply rooted forces drawing Catherine toward Mrs. Tilney’s bedroom than a few pages of a novel, or a copperplate illustration.\n\n\u003e Of all Jane’s novels it’s not *[[books/persuasion|Persuasion]]* but *Northanger Abbey* that comes closest to sexual explicitness.\n\u003e \n\u003e Despite what the film adaptations would have you believe, we don’t often see Jane’s heroines in their nightgowns or their underwear. In *Northanger Abbey*, we do. Its three bedroom scenes are charged—entirely deliberately—with an erotic thrill.\n\n\u003e Is country-bred Catherine, the fourth of ten children, ignorant of how babies come into the world? Surely not. She must have seen her own mother lying in, a new brother or sister in her arms, squashed and shrieking, the bloodied sheets being bundled downstairs. The Morlands’ country vicarage may be far less Gothic than an abbey, but it’s had its own, temporary torture chamber at times, and Catherine will have heard the screams.\n\n\u003e For those who wonder, endlessly, why Jane never married, there’s a reason right here. Mrs. Tilney’s room—the only marital bedroom Jane ever shows us in detail—is associated, indelibly, with death. Not only is this the room in which, as we’re told, Mrs. Tilney died; it’s a room haunted by the ghosts of literature, by the dead marchioness’s suite at the Chateau-le-Blanc; by Blue Beard’s chamber, filled with the corpses of his dead wives.\n\n\u003e This, in the end, is the mystery, the terrifying secret at the heart of Northanger Abbey. If we laughed at the hilarious notion of Catherine’s mother dying during one of her ten pregnancies and labors, then this is where we should stop laughing; sex can kill you. All of Jane’s heroines—all of the women in her novels who marry—are taking a terrifying risk. They’re placing their lives, potentially, in the hands of their husbands.\n\n\u003e A reader might imagine that no one survived much beyond fifty in the early nineteenth century, though in fact, if you adjust for the far higher rates of infant and maternal mortality, life expectancy wasn’t so very much lower than it is today.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.039464978Z","tags":[]},"/books/perv":{"title":"Perv","content":"- For the longest time, to be a pervert wasn’t to be a sex deviant; it was to be an atheist\n- Almost overnight, “pervert” goes from “immoral religious heretic” to “immoral sexual deviant” because Havelock Ellis\n- The [[notes/naturalistic fallacy|naturalistic fallacy]] of polyamory, homosexuality, etc. (a rebuttal to *[[books/sex at dawn|Sex at Dawn]]*)\n- Instead of “natural” or “unnatural”: Is it harmful?\n- [[notes/moral panics and mass hysteria|The pig-man hunts of New Haven]]\n- Even the term “bestiality” is religious, first appearing in the King James Version of the Bible in 1611 to falsely cleave apart human beings from all other animals\n- [[notes/moral dumbfounding is not moral reasoning|moral dumbfounding is not moral reasoning]]\n- The symbolic disgust response is a [[notes/disgust is a culture-bound syndrome|disgust is a culture-bound syndrome]]\n- The concept of the “perversions” (or “going against what is right”) is entirely a phantom of the moralizing human mind.\n- “Harm” must be understood as harm experienced by the parties involved, not by us as “disgusted” onlookers\n- ==Morality isn’t “out there” in the world; it’s a *way of seeing*, and it’s constantly evolving==\n- One of the first uses of radiotherapy was the obliteration of teenage girls’ clitorises to discourage them from masturbating (not in backwater clinics, either, but in some of the most fashionable cities in the world, including London and Manhattan.

And once we acknowledge this lack of universality, the illusion that there’s anything like an objective right and wrong in the vast domain of our species’s libidinal relations shatters beyond repair.\n\n\u003e The emotional atmosphere of our own culture has undergone such radical social climate changes that to assume we’re now finally glimpsing a clear moral reality that previous generations simply didn’t notice because of their ignorance and cloudy biases would be stupendously foolish of us.\n\n\u003e In the days when there were still kings in France, there was King Louis XIII, or Louis the Chaste. On the throne from 1610 to 1643, the least erotically minded monarch in French history was, it turns out, a pretty active homosexual. I’m referring not to the curious detail of his setting an international fashion craze for men’s wigs that lasted centuries but to the fact that he spent much of his reign in bed with a crimson-headed marquis who’d been gifted to him as a sexual companion by his sensible first minister.\n\n\u003e Peculiar as Rivière’s ideas sound today, the medicalization of female arousal has historically been more the norm than the exception. Such an approach to women’s lust certainly didn’t end with the Enlightenment. The feminist sociologist Carol Groneman has traced ==the long and depressingly misogynistic history of reproductive medicine==, focusing most of her attention on those infamously rigid Victorian attitudes of the nineteenth century. During this period, women continued to be seen as either passive receptacles for men’s pleasures or chattel for the purposes of men’s breeding. (Either way, pathological modesty dictated their flesh be drowned in heavy garments.)\n\n\u003e The variance of our natural libidos (even the points at the extreme ends) is the same as differences in our skin color, the shapes of our noses, or our tolerance for dairy products. Just as it’s illogical to judge a person for his or her unique expression of those traits, it makes little sense to ascribe moral significance to the way a person’s genes happen to be expressed on this particular spectrum of sexual diversity.\n\n\u003e Here’s an exercise in the hypothetical that may be helpful for those of you who fall more along the far vanilla side of the Neapolitan ice cream erotic equation. Let’s say you’ve been placed in a witness protection program and you suddenly have to create a new identity of being gay, which is the most vital part of your cover. You must move all alone to a place where nobody knows you, and you must convince everyone you meet, for your own safety and for the safety of those you care most about, that you’re 100 percent homosexual. Now, don’t try too hard to appear gay, because you’ll give yourself away, so be stereotypical but not too stereotypical, yet don’t ever let your guard down either, since some people will try to trick you into revealing the truth by being “understanding,” and it’s hard to know if they actually do know, too, so err on the side of caution and assume they don’t. Watch what you say, where your eyes go, what you do in your spare time, whom you’re seen with, and careful, now, no matter how close you get to someone in this new life of yours, no one must ever discover that you’re really a heterosexual. All that you know and hold dear—and I can’t emphasize this part enough—hangs in the balance. Whatever you do, and in fact you better make this your mantra, *don’t be yourself.*\n\u003e \n\u003e If living under such intense social conditions for the next twenty, forty, sixty, or even eighty years wouldn’t do a number on your nerves (and by that I mean cause “personal distress”), then you’re simply not human. Yet this is exactly how many people today live their entire lives.\n\n\u003e In the history of our species, there have been far more babies born to ovulating thirteen- and fourteen-year-old girls than there have to men who have sex with men. So for social conservatives to draw from that insipid old argument that homosexuality is “biologically unnatural” and therefore “morally wrong” is essentially for them to say that sex with pubescent girls is “biologically natural” and therefore “morally right.” And that’s rather ironic, isn’t it, given that so much of the fuel for today’s pedophilia panic and antigay mentality lies at the fiery heart of the right-wing community.\n\u003e \n\u003e (And I hope you’re able to see clearly by now, by the way, why the issue of “normality” is so morally vacuous and why the question of harm must instead prevail before we can ever hope to make any real ethical progress in these debates.)\n\n\u003e In adopting a patently false but stubbornly clung-to mythology of human sexuality that makes demons out of natural drives, we’ve entered a stage of moral sickness, not of moral health. The good news is that it’s just a stage, not a terminal illness. And as we’ve seen quite clearly throughout, when it comes to sex, we human beings are a work in progress.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/pet":{"title":"Pet","content":"A YA book that discusses [[authors/hannah arendt|Hannah Arendt]] and [[books/the origins of totalitarianism|the banality of evil]] in the introduction, then goes on to drop some biblically accurate angels?

And don’t worry, I’m not about to be the killjoy that strips the romance from it this time. This novel *is* romantic, a true meeting of minds with the happiest ending Jane Austen has on offer. A fairy tale through and through, it’s just that it’s a *political* fairy-tale as much as a romantic one, and benefits from a much closer reading, noting the larger class themes at work and the transgressive choices Austen makes. For example, it’s easy to see Collins as the definitive buffoon, Lady Catherine as a belligerent absurdity. It’s harder to see, through the layers of time, the larger (and utterly blistering) critique of the Church of England and the aristocracy. Or the lengths to which Darcy and Elizabeth transgress propriety. That context makes the relationship and character growth all the more meaningful, and all the more relevant in any age. Overturning our prejudices indeed, not just individually and romantically for a pair of fine eyes, but socially, culturally, at large.\n\n(Note: I never thought I’d be comparing Austen to [[authors/marquis de sade|de Sade]], but since I read *[[books/gothic tales|Gothic Tales]]* recently, they’re both similar in the way I wish their political context was better known.)\n\n---\n\n## A few notes\n\n- After *[[books/sense and sensibility|Sense and Sensibility]]*, *Pride and Prejudice* is so warm, its emotions genuine. I laugh at how quickly Darcy is swept off his feet by Elizabeth—love at second sight?—but then he goes about building a foundation for it, unselfish in ways great and small. There’s no double-speak this time, the actions here match the words.\n- It’s also quite pleasant to be back on straightforward, solid ground with a reliable narrator. If anything, reading this back to back with S\u0026S highlights exactly how destabilizing that text is. *Pride and Prejudice* is not deploying those narrative tricks.\n- I also want it on the record that I love book Darcy so much. Due to reasons of sexual orientation and personal taste, I’m not the biggest fan of the ubiquitous Colin Firth Darcy or even the slightly less ubiquitous Matthew MacFadyn Darcy—basically, sex symbol Darcy. Book Darcy, though, should not be tainted by association in my eyes. Rude, bookish, intelligent, open-minded Darcy. [[series/mo dao zu shi novel|Big Lan Zhan vibes]] tbh.\n\n- [[authors/helena kelly|Helena Kelly]] makes a convincing case that Edmund Burke’s *Reflections on the Revolution in France,* widely read in Austen’s day, is the key to Austen’s language here. \n  \n  \u003e “Prejudice,” then, in the 1790s, isn’t simply bias or judging without all the facts; it’s tradition, “inbred sentiments,” unquestioned cultural assumptions. It’s the entire edifice of society. The monarchy, the government, the judicial system, organized religion, the class system: all are to be upheld simply because they’ve been around for a long time. “Awe,” “duty,” “reverence,” “respect”—these are the “old prejudices.”\n  \n  Note those last four words: when they’re in the mouth of a character, it’s Collins, or Lady Catherine, or Darcy 1.0 in the beginning. Mary Bennett from time to time. The characters who are priggish and insufferable. Every single trait that Austen sets about correcting or condemning. She’s reassessing the way society works on a fundamental level, challenging Burke’s “prejudices” and dispelling the notion that the certainties of rank are what hold society together.\n- Re: rank and class: it’s not just the typical fairytale of a high-ranked gentleman marrying a woman from the lower classes, either. Austen thoroughly dismantles the notion that class is an indicator of worth. Look how many times “trade” and “Cheapside” appear. Bingley is decent and kind; his background is trade. The Gardiners hail from Cheapside. Elizabeth thoroughly scorns Lady Catherine but look who changes her opinion of Darcy at Pemberley—Mrs. Reynolds the housekeeper, then the gardener and groundskeeper. Servants are regularly more intelligent than their masters (think Hill and Mrs. Bennett). Elizabeth, and the narrator on her behalf, talk about “the authority of a servant” with far more respect than any given to the nobility.\n- Meanwhile, Collins is a leech on his parish, existing more to collect taxes and tithes and slaver over the aristocracy than offer anything of substance in return. For god’s sake, *Wickham* was going to be accepted into the clergy! That’s where their standards lay. Lady Catherine concerns herself with the poor villagers only to silence and bully them into contentment with their lot. Darcy’s rank is held against him until he can do something decent. By the end, we’ve accomplished a complete role-reversal: the very last paragraph is the now-wedded Darcys’ mutual love for and close relations with the Gardiners, while the noble Lady Catherine is only allowed at Pemberley on their sufferance. Quite literally upending society in the course of a book.\n- To that end, the role of social introductions is so important; who is introduced to whom, and in what order, or not introduced at all. Modern audiences (myself included!) have no context for this. Every edition of P\u0026P should have to explain that context in the foreword because it illuminates the book. (See quotes below for a brief overview.) There are at least 30 social introductions throughout the text, performed at various degrees of propriety or impropriety. The most important point of that being: Elizabeth refuses to be introduced to Darcy at the Meryton ball, and on page, their entire relationship takes place, proceeding straight on to marriage, without ever initiating a formal acquaintance. We’d think nothing of it, but in the day, that is Austen being intentional and transgressive.\n- Whose relationship, on the other hand, follows every proper form, from introduction to betrothal to marriage? Which match obeys every societal convention and suits their respective stations? Collins and Charlotte. And we’re revolted. \n- In fact, Charlotte speaks the received wisdom: “It’s better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.” And look where that gets her. (As Helena Kelly puts it, she “suffers the fate worse than death.”) The only happy couples in the book are the ones that defy that principle.\n- One of my favorite parts of the book is Collins’s correspondence with Mr. Bennet, especially during the Lydia/Wickham scandal. His abhorrent, unkind, obnoxious, self-righteous sentiments on the subject are… actually, just the widely-held opinions of society and the church. Framing them in that light, with Mr. Bennet laughing at their foolishness, is such a brilliant touch.\n- One final contrast with S\u0026S is the ending… instead of the mercenary, provisional “happy ever after,” P\u0026P situates Darcy and Elizabeth firmly within a community and happy household. Jane and Bingley are close; the Gardiners are closer; Elizabeth is already ~~corrupting~~ instructing Georgiana on the liberties one should take. Instead of the cycle set up to repeat, it shows the cycle being broken, to the benefit of all except Lady Catherine.\n\n---\n\n## *Pride and Prejudice* in context\n\nSince this was a re-read after *[[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]],* I’m going to put my relevant highlights from that book here.\n\n\u003e In a society where unmarried men and women were largely kept separate, and permitted to socialize only when properly chaperoned, how could a woman arrive at any sort of knowledge of a man’s character, and how could a man hope to understand the nature of the woman he married?\n\u003e \n\u003e In *[[books/mansfield park|Mansfield Park]]* and *[[books/emma|Emma]]* the heroines seek safety in quasi-incestuous marriages with men who are closely connected to their families and whom they have known for years. In *Pride and Prejudice,* though, Jane suggests an altogether more revolutionary approach to the problem.\n\n\u003e Readers influenced by the screen adaptations of *Pride and Prejudice* may see Mr. Bennet as an affable, mildly eccentric, delightfully humorous father. His withdrawal from his wife and five daughters is usually depicted as a completely understandable retreat from an excess of hysterical, hormonal femininity. Jane makes it clear, though, that he is dangerously lax—ineffectual, incompetent. According to Lizzy, her father has “talents,” but they have not been “rightly used”—a damning indictment in a churchgoing culture still steeped in the language and stories of the Bible.\n\n\u003e The idea that Jane’s novels offer a blissful, almost drugged-up, break from harsh reality doesn’t hold water, though. Remember that Britain was at war with France from 1793 to 1815, with only two short periods of peace. It’s this background that we have to place the books against. The “emigrant” mentioned in passing in *[[books/sense and sensibility|Sense and Sensibility]]* is a refugee from the French Revolution. Easy enough to miss the reference if you wanted to try to make the war and revolutionary unrest disappear; Jane doesn’t.\n\n\u003e At the end of the book, when Jane details the various fates of the different characters, she mentions, explicitly, “the restoration of peace.” The whole action of the novel, then, takes place during active hostilities. But to Jane’s first readers this would have been apparent from early on.\n\n\u003e I grew up near Chatham in Kent, which was for centuries a major naval base. It’s ringed with hilltop fortifications built or extensively remodeled during the Napoleonic Wars. Throughout Jane’s adulthood, people were terrified of being invaded by the French. There was a degree of scaremongering involved. It was far from unusual for newspapers to carry alarmist reports in which invasion was made to seem imminent. But scaremongering wasn’t the only reason people were afraid. Fourteen hundred French troops landed at Fishguard in Wales in 1797. They quickly surrendered, but they landed. ((nb: I’m aware of this much more vividly thanks to [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] and her [[series/doomsday books|Doomsday Books]] set in Kent, especially *[[books/the secret lives of country gentlemen|The Secret Lives of Country Gentlemen]]*.))\n\n\u003e But whenever—and in whatever guise—*Pride and Prejudice* was begun, by the time Jane came to publish it, she had herself lived in what was, for all intents and purposes, a garrison town. The glamour, for her, had worn off.\n\n\u003e The names of the hero (Darcy) and of his aunt (de Bourgh) sound and look French. The first is occasionally printed as “D’Arcy” in later nineteenth-century editions of the novel. “De Bourgh” isn’t even vaguely anglicized. Why make characters with French names aristocrats and the owners of large landholdings if you don’t want to bring up what had happened in France—the abandoning of titles, the confiscation of estates, the guillotining?\n\n\u003e Jane’s novels are unusual for their period in that they seldom feature members of the “nobility,” the titled aristocracy. Her near contemporaries—Maria Edgeworth, Fanny Burney—love a lord or a lady. Jane doesn’t, an aspect of her work that was remarked on by more than one early critic. “Her characters,” suggests an essay of 1830, “are for the most part commonplace people…of secondary station, and hardly ever exhibited through that halo of rank and wealth which makes many an ill-drawn sketch pass…with a credulous public.”\n\n\u003e Perhaps emboldened by the fact that Lord Fitzwilliam appeared completely unaware or unconcerned that she’d made use of his name, Jane appears to have borrowed more from him; Lord Fitzwilliam lived at the vast Yorkshire mansion called Wentworth Woodhouse.\n\n\u003e ==So does this novel—with a title that seems to direct our attention toward Burke, and featuring characters with names that do likewise—look up with awe to kings, with affection to parliaments, with duty to magistrates, with reverence to priests, and with respect to nobility? Not so much.==\n\n\u003e Now, in Jane’s novels gossip isn’t always seen negatively. In *[[books/emma|Emma]]*, as we’ll discover, the relentless gossiping of the loquacious spinster Miss Bates frequently exposes the truth, and the truth, for Jane, is necessary. Similar revelations arise from gossip in *[[books/persuasion|Persuasion]]*. Here, though, it does look as if we are meant to think a little less of Colonel Fitzwilliam. The affair is nothing at all to do with him, and besides he barely knows Elizabeth.\n\n\u003e But Elizabeth’s impression of Lady Catherine is, as far as we can tell, completely unconnected to Darcy; she’s only just discovered that the two are related. What Jane is offering her readers here is a potent and, for some, terrifying cocktail—a dash of personal and class resentment, a measure of clear-eyed judgment.\n\n\u003e A young, unmarried woman with connections in trade and a lieutenant of militia, the son of a steward, an estate manager, sit and shred the character of a much older woman, a lady, a member of the nobility, who has the power to pick a clergyman to serve her local parish and who we’re meant to imagine might be related to prime ministers.\n\u003e \n\u003e This, right here, is a revolutionary moment.\n\n\u003e A conservative novel would show its readers how wrong Elizabeth is, or at the very least introduce a truly positive aristocratic character by way of counterweight. Darcy could have been made into this counterweight, but, as we’ll see, he isn’t, or not in any straightforward way. Instead, Elizabeth’s suspicions (and ours) turn out not to have gone far enough. In spite of her title and her lineage, Lady Catherine isn’t just conceited; she’s shockingly ill-bred, far worse than the vulgar Mrs. Jennings in *Sense and Sensibility*, who, if she sometimes blunders tactlessly, has a kind heart.\n\n\u003e Jane’s not exactly showing her readers a perfectly functioning system here, is she, any more than she is with the militia? Not only are the cottagers “poor” and “discontented”; Lady Catherine doesn’t do anything for them, apart from scolding them. She’s not a Lady Bountiful. There is, for her, no sense of noblesse oblige, no feeling that noble rank entails any sort of responsibility. From the corner of our eyes we can see the shadow of the guillotine.\n\n\u003e There’s no unthinking respect for the nobility in *Pride and Prejudice*, any more than there’s reverence for Mr. Collins.\n\u003e \n\u003e In fact Jane makes it clear that titles and blood count for very little. In this novel, being “gentlemanlike” has almost nothing to do with your social position. Colonel Fitzwilliam is; Darcy, for much of the novel, isn’t. Mr. Bingley is, and his money “had been acquired by trade.”\n\n\u003e Mr. Bennet barely bothers to write to his wife and daughters during his attempts to discover Lydia in London; Mr. Gardiner, by contrast, makes a point of keeping them informed. He does all the things that Lydia’s own father ought to be doing. His wife, too, is as close to an exemplary character as Jane allows us to come in *Pride and Prejudice.*\n\n\u003e ==It’s a significant departure, this, to make the characters who live by trade not only so much the most agreeable of the older generation but also the novel’s moral arbiters. Jane makes no effort to soften the realities of their social position.==\n\n\u003e The social hierarchy during this period fetishized the ownership of land, as we’ve seen, but it was just about willing to overlook the fact that money had come from trade provided that there was enough of it and that the source was decently concealed. In *Pride and Prejudice*, by contrast, we’re encouraged to think far more positively of Mr. Gardiner than we are of Sir William Lucas, whose knighthood “had given him a disgust to his business” and led him to abandon it, although he is by no means rich (he can afford to give Charlotte “little fortune” when she marries, and he appears to have at least five children).\n\n\u003e In the other novels, Jane’s readers would have known, city characters—characters involved in trade—are included for broad comedy or to create embarrassment for heroines. In one novel we know Jane liked—*Emmeline*, by Charlotte Smith—the character who started his career as “a clerk to an attorney in the city” is “cunning,” interested in only “place or profit.” The heroine has suitors who are engaged in business and are, clearly, meant to be repellent. The only men she seriously considers are noblemen. In Burney’s *Evelina*, our beautiful young protagonist fairly writhes under the humiliation of having relations in trade.\n\n\u003e In *Pride and Prejudice*, though, Darcy’s mindless snobbery isn’t allowed to stand. It can’t be justified. For the first half of the novel he is certain both of his own place in the social hierarchy and of everyone else’s, viewing status less as opinion than as fact. ==For him, it’s immutable, self-evident. It’s an idea which is so obviously right that it has never occurred to him to question it. It’s a prejudice, in Burkean terms—something that has to be correct because everyone’s thought it for ages.==\n\n\u003e Darcy’s first proposal to Elizabeth continues down the same—prejudiced—path. Jane withholds most of the proposal itself. “You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you,” Jane has him declare, before promptly shifting into summary and stopping him from telling the reader much at all. Now, it’s rather a feature of her novels that successful proposals aren’t written down in full, to the frustration of generations of scriptwriters. The exception is *Persuasion*, Jane’s last (more or less) complete novel, and that’s rather a unique proposal anyway, because the hero and heroine were engaged to each other before, and she indirectly declares her love first.\n\n\u003e Social introductions are referred to thirty times in *Pride and Prejudice*. To compare this with the other novels of slightly greater length, there are nineteen incidences in *Mansfield Park*, twenty-three in *Emma*, and fifteen in *Sense and Sensibility*. In several scenes, the exact form and correctness of introductions are explicitly addressed, as when Mr. Collins introduces himself, very improperly, to Mr. Darcy.\n\n\u003e Introductions were an important moment.\n\u003e \n\u003e Which makes it all the more remarkable—and all the more obviously deliberate—that Elizabeth and Darcy aren’t ever, as far as we can see, introduced to each other. In fact, they actively resist the efforts of other characters to make them formally acquainted.\n\n\u003e Darcy’s refusal to interact with his perceived social inferiors leads to some strangulated, triangulated conversations, as when Mrs. Bennet, taking offense at a comment that Darcy addresses in front of her, but to Miss Bingley, is forced to refer to him as “that gentleman.” Her apparent rudeness at the end of the novel, when she speaks to Darcy only in the shortest of sentences, is in fact an attempt at socially correct behavior under circumstances that Darcy has made extremely problematic.\n\n\u003e Usually introductions required a third person, someone who was acquainted with both parties—a guarantor, if you like, of each side’s good faith and good character. Places like Bath, where it could be difficult to find someone to do this, had a master of ceremonies to carry out the role instead. It was all quite formalized. It also required a decision as to the relative social status of the parties, because generally the party who was lower in status was introduced to the party who was higher or who had more to lose, so young people to older people, single people to married people, untitled to titled, men to women. Once you had been introduced, you could dance, converse, and so on. It was possible, though, for either party to reject the introduction, to show his or her unwillingness to be acquainted. (It’s the courtesy traditionally given to women, that of treating them, temporarily, as the higher-status party in an introduction.)\n\n\u003e It isn’t simply that Elizabeth doesn’t want to dance with Darcy; she doesn’t want to be formally acquainted with him, or at least not like this. She doesn’t once address Darcy here; she speaks through Sir William. As far as she’s concerned, the message she’s sending is clear: she isn’t prepared to acknowledge Darcy as her social superior.\n\n\u003e It’s a moment that radical thinkers would have recognized, a stripping back to essentials, the propounding of a problem. What happens with something as apparently everyday and straightforward as an introduction if the two parties can’t agree on their relative social status?\n\n\u003e So she sets up a situation where, first of all, Darcy refuses to be introduced to Elizabeth and then Elizabeth refuses to be introduced to Darcy. And she has the two of them embark on a relationship that takes place, almost entirely, outside social norms, one in which all kinds of set ideas and traditional concepts—prejudices—are uprooted.\n\n\u003e [At this point in the novel, Bingley and Jane’s] interactions are nothing like enough to make them understand each other’s character; it’s a shaky foundation for married life, for all its decorum.\n\u003e \n\u003e In comparison, Darcy and Elizabeth have, during an identical time frame, danced once, dined together several times, argued a lot, walked alone together, sat alone in rooms together, debated, corresponded, and insulted each other’s family (him) and manners (her). Darcy has proposed and been rejected. He’s detailed the sexual peccadilloes of his younger sister.\n\n\u003e ==We’re so familiar with what happens between them that we fail to register quite how wholly improper much of their behavior is. Theirs is an astonishingly frank, astonishingly intense relationship, and almost no one, except for the two of them, knows that it’s happening at all, certainly not the true extent of it.== The news of their engagement comes as a complete shock to Elizabeth’s family; it’s met with flat incredulity.\n\u003e \n\u003e Elizabeth, we know, is impatient of convention and established modes of behavior, not for the sake of being contrary, but when she considers that they’re being clung to for no good reason.\n\n\u003e Elizabeth is, fundamentally, a radical. She knows her own mind; she reserves the right to decide questions for herself. There are plenty of kinds of authority that she doesn’t recognize, or tolerates only as far as it suits her. On occasion we see her all but disciplining her own mother.\n\n\u003e When, toward the end of the novel, Lady Catherine appears on Elizabeth’s doorstep and demands that the younger woman undertake never to marry Darcy, her demands are couched in language that Burke would have recognized and approved, the kind of language he used himself in *Reflections on the Revolution*. It’s all obligation, obedience, claims, “honour, decorum, prudence,” “duty,” and “gratitude.” And it comes up against a completely different kind of language. “You have no right,” announces Elizabeth. “What is that to me?” she asks. She is, she says, “only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness.” Society be damned; Darcy and Elizabeth’s relationship has nothing to do with anyone else.\n\n\u003e ==Elizabeth’s undutifulness as a daughter, her laughter, her lack of reverence for Mr. Collins, her lack of respect for Lady Catherine de Bourgh, they’re all of a piece. Elizabeth is, in short, constructed to be a conservative’s nightmare.==\n\n\u003e With her impatience of convention, Elizabeth transgresses almost as much as Marianne Dashwood does, perhaps even more, but Jane never devises any punishment for her. There’s no illness, no betrayal, no watching the man she loves marry someone else while she makes do with second best, as poor Marianne has to endure. All Elizabeth is made to do is change her mind about Darcy when she’s presented with new evidence, which is completely in line with radical thinking.\n\n\u003e He has pride in his birth, he has prejudices in favor of rank, he appeals, at times, to recognized authority and to “natural”—generally accepted, time-honored—ideas, but Jane makes it apparent from early on that he is “clever,” too clever, ultimately, to reject the justice of Elizabeth’s criticisms and arguments.\n\u003e \n\u003e In fact there are indications that he’s receptive to new ideas even before he begins to be seriously attracted to Elizabeth.\n\n\u003e Darcy is excited by Elizabeth’s unconventionality; it speaks deeply to some hidden, largely repressed part of his own character. He can’t stop himself from arguing with her, about women’s accomplishments, about poetry, about Scottish dancing, about music, about other people, about themselves. In Kent, he deliberately and repeatedly seeks her out, prolonging his visit to his aunt and cousin at Rosings so that he can spend more time with Elizabeth.\n\n\u003e A more conservative character, in a more conservative novel, wouldn’t accept that his behavior needed to be explained. Nor would he be open to being reformed. The conduct of a character like Darcy wouldn’t be open to criticism in a conservative novel.\n\n\u003e Eighteenth-century writers were deeply uneasy about making their upper-class characters marry out. There are few exigencies to which they aren’t reduced, in their desperation to achieve social parity between hero and heroine. Children are switched at nurse; villainous uncles hide the rightful heirs; foundlings turn out to be related to the local landowner after all; fortunes appear; marriage certificates are discovered; guardians marry their wards; cousins marry each other.\n\u003e \n\u003e Jane doesn’t do this in *Pride and Prejudice*.\n\n\u003e The marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth is not, as her father fears it might be, “unequal.” Each comes to admire and respect the other. Their relationship begins with a refusal to accept social inequality, and it ends with it, too.\n\n\u003e Lady Catherine, by contrast, is admitted only on sufferance and because Elizabeth wishes it. Of the new, extended family that Elizabeth and Darcy create, the family members that Darcy is happiest with, apart from his sister, the ones he is “on the most intimate terms” with, the ones he is “sensible of the warmest gratitude towards,” are, in the end, the Gardiners, the low connections in trade. Pemberley isn’t “polluted,” as Lady Catherine fears. Instead, it keeps the best of the old and welcomes the best of the new.\n\n\u003e Any reader fully sensitized to the loaded language of revolution and counterrevolution would have read *Pride and Prejudice* for what it is—a revolutionary fairy tale, a fantasy of how, with reform, with radical rethinking, society can be safely remodeled.\n\n\u003e If society were reformed, and the revolution to take place bloodlessly, then there would be no need to worry that popular disaffection would flourish, and no way the government could justify retaining an armed force to subdue its own people. Once peace returns, as it does—duly, symbolically—at the end of the novel, Elizabeth and Darcy can continue their radical marriage, freed from senseless or inconsistent rules and conventions. Together they will read, and debate, and remain open to new ideas, ready to cast off prejudices that no longer fit. It’s a fairy-tale ending; it’s a sweet-natured one. No one—not even Wickham, not Lady Catherine—is punished.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/profit-pathology-and-other-indecencies":{"title":"Profit Pathology and Other Indecencies","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/propaganda-blitz":{"title":"Propaganda Blitz","content":"For years I’ve wanted a successor to *[[books/manufacturing consent|Manufacturing Consent]]* that is a bit more current and accessible — this might not exactly fill those shoes, but it comes pretty damn close.\n\nSee the helpful excerpt here: [[notes/anatomy of a propaganda blitz|anatomy of a propaganda blitz]]","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/proper-english":{"title":"Proper English","content":"It’s the House Party from Hell, and the first time I read it, I was like this is exhausting, it’s claustrophobic, not sure I can vibe with it—but then I read it again in 2020 and YES.

This should not come as a surprise, because women in general and mothers in particular are required over and over again, under a wide range of circumstances, to put themselves aside, to forget.”\n\n## Motherhood: role or relationship?\n\nDonath argues a distinction between roles and relationships: as long as we frame motherhood as a role, with a rigid set of expectations that mothers are just implicitly expected to be good at, rather than an ever-evolving relationship that flows between mother and child and mother and all the other relationships she has in her life, we limit the emotional reactions mothers are allowed to have to their experiences as mothers and we limit the ways mothers can relate to their lives generally.\n\nSocietally, we’re used to and accept people who regret their marriages because we view that as a relationship between two people. But as long as we keep MOTHER as a role in capital letters, we’re going to keep suffering.\n\nThis is really the crux of the research—by restricting women to roles we refuse to get to know them as individual people. Where would we be if we told the truth to each other, and ourselves?\n\n## Category violation\n\n\u003e “If we realize that part of being a subject is to make calculations and weigh one’s options about what is valuable and worthwhile for one’s own life, then we can understand the wider meanings of the social expectations that mothers will not weigh their options and make evaluations regarding their motherhood. In other words, the social reaction to regret as a horrifying rationality demonstrates how mothers are deprived of their right to stay connected to their own understandings and, experiences and the intimate relationships in which they are involved. They cannot even pause for a minute to assess the state of their motherhood and their own lives, because ==it is too frightening to society – which depends upon mothers as objects who exist for the sake of others –when they do not stay put as such.==”\n\nVery very closely linked to the moral panics about queer sexuality, gender, etc. etc. In a hierarchal society violations of category cannot be tolerated, because the existence of the hierarchy depends on the enforcement of the categories.\n\n\u003e Since the nineteenth century, nationalist, capitalist, heteronormative, and patriarchal ideologies have joined hands to sustain this gendered division of labor — because without women’s unpaid labor as mothers and homemakers, the system would fall apart - while stressing that this division is ‘natural,’ and therefore eternal.\n\nIf they are so natural and eternal, why would they have to be vigilantly policed and enforced?\n## The ultimate taboo\n\nEven as some of our categories get more fluid or roles get reevaluated, it is still the ultimate taboo in society, women who regret becoming mothers. Yes, women can have careers, but they MUST be moms. Yes, women can be gay, but they MUST be moms. And they must WANT to be moms.\n\nOur social structure relies on the silencing of women who do not want to be mothers, or who regret becoming mothers. ==The status quo subjugation of women is reliant on women being denied emotional agency to feel however they feel about their lives and circumstances.==\n\nHow do we change the conversation? By telling the truth about the experiences that ALL women have, in all the diversity of our needs, yearnings, dreams, and realities.\n\nThe worst thing that we can do for mothers and children alike is pretend that there is one clear path for everyone.\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e When it comes to reproduction and the transition to motherhood, it is crucial to cast doubt on this rhetoric of all-embracing choice: how much room to maneuver do women actually have if we are free to choose only _what society wants us to choose?_\n\n\u003e The statement ‘I love my children but regret my motherhood’ is very often seen as impossible by definition — because doesn’t a wish to erase motherhood mean a wish to erase those children she loves? Yet a statement such as ‘I love him, but I regret I ever met him’ following a painful romantic relationship would hardly be considered paradoxical. In other words, it may be the sacredness we have placed on motherhood that prevents us from accepting that a woman can both love _and_ acknowledge the broader implications of that love in her life.\n\n\u003e On one hand, facing them [the accounts of regretted motherhood] may have torturous consequences; on the other hand, avoiding them may prevent us from understanding social worlds and changing them for the benefit of those who suffer from them. With this in mind, I believe the question ‘Why talk about regretting motherhood?’ should be flipped the other way around: What are the consequences of silencing regret over motherhood? Who pays the price when we try to pretend it does not exist?","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/reputation":{"title":"Reputation","content":"Lex Croucher’s lols-per-page cannot be beat.\n\nWeirdly, the only character I was meh on was the love interest, just because he’s _too_ perfect.

And hoo boy does it benefit from close reading.\n\nI’m already predisposed to read Jane Austen politically, and I’m already inclined to claim *Sense and Sensibility* is Austen venting her spleen at the English inheritance law instead of a swoony romance. But reading the book for what it is instead of what we expect to see, thanks to a dozen soft-focus adaptations, produces a *very* different story from Hugh Grant mumbling charmingly while Emma Thompson weeps with joy, happy ever after.[^1]\n\nEconomics and primogeniture fill the page much more than affection and romance. Not a single marriage in the book is written as if it’s a desirable state. In true Austen fashion, what the story *tells* us is painfully different than what it *shows*.\n\nIt’s a book of hearsay and projection, a novel-length game of telephone half a century before the telephone was invented. Rarely do two characters inhabit the same reality. Highlighting every occurrence of *imagine* or *fancy* or *assume* or *conjecture* or *believe* means every page was bleeding ink. (This feels absolutely intentional; even in *[[books/pride and prejudice|Pride and Prejudice]]*, where the premise is mistaken impressions, these words are used much less often.)\n\nEven Austen’s infamous narrative voice is used to cunning effect: the supposedly omniscient narrator, instead of zooming out to provide a clearer picture, repeatedly and intentionally zooms *in* on one person’s grossly mistaken perspective, to obscure the picture further. Mrs. Jennings eavesdrops and is convinced Elinor and Colonel Brandon are on the cusp of matrimony; Elinor has no more sense though, she’s done the same to Marianne, and even her tendre for Edward has been pulled out of the same thin air. (Elinor, far from being uniquely sensible, is fooled nearly as often as the others, in ways that make [[books/emma|Emma Woodhouse]] look downright astute.)\n\nThere’s a fascinating layer to all of this, where we as readers, centuries removed from the original context, have done the same. If we expect to see Willoughby the scoundrel and Edward the hero, we dismiss the parallels between them and fail to see the similarities in their actions. If we read it as a romance, our mind’s eye filling in Colonel Brandon as the lovely Alan Rickman, then we overlook all the discrepancies and uncomfortable hints in the text that Austen’s initial audience would know. (Avignon; the criminality of the East India Company; enriching himself on the family fortune at the expense of his female relatives, etc.) \n\nWhat’s *not* there tells the story. Austen does so much sleight of hand that genre writers, horror and SFF alike, could take a page from her book on how to destabilize a narrative and make it unsettling as fuck. (Then again, the effect has arguably been missed by generations of readers, so perhaps it’s too subtle.) (Then *again* again, readers of those genres would be way more attuned to those vibes than those expecting straight romance? Maybe that’s why it seems incredibly clear to me??? I dunno, interesting to think about.)\n\nIf [[authors/mary wollstonecraft shelley|Mary Shelley]] invented science fiction, then I’m entertaining bold claims of Austen’s own genre inventions, is what I’m saying.\n\nBut it’s the elder [[authors/mary wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], Mary Shelley’s mother, who is the necessary touchstone. Themes resonate, often loudly, with Austen using parallel phrases as well. Helena Kelly delves into it further, but here are a few relevant quotes from her chapter on *Sense and Sensibility*:\n\n\u003e Jane wasn’t alone in questioning the fundamental fairness of primogeniture. The feminist writer [[authors/mary wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraft]] did it too, in her 1792 book, *[[books/a vindication of the rights of woman|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]],* asserting that “children of the same parents” have “an equal right.” The passage in which she makes this claim is worth looking at more closely.\n\u003e \n\u003e Wollstonecraft begins by talking about the common opposition between male “reason” and female “sensibility,” before moving on to discuss how women are persuaded—or coerced—into devoting themselves to “the duties of a mother and the mistress of a family.”\n\n\u003e For Wollstonecraft, it’s clear that the current system of inheritance erodes instincts of fairness and generosity, that it warps the very idea of family and natural affection. In a society like this, even sensibility, fine feeling, a sense of connection to others, can only ever operate bluntly, selfishly, and with an eye to the main chance. And the sexual responsiveness that (most) men are looking for in women? Well, that becomes something to be exchanged, too.\n\nRe-reading with that in mind, those themes recur everywhere, as if it’s Wollstonecraft’s treatise in fictional form. \n\nThe Dashwood women are evicted from the only place they’re told they belong: their home. Their father and brother each fail them. By the end of the novel, their husbands are poised to do the same.[^2] This pattern repeats with each family, the Ferrars, the Brandons, even the Middletons. Families and relationships are warped along the fault lines of greed and survival, and the laws and etiquette that society dictates as moral. \n\nAnd at the center of that is the transaction of matrimony. Like I said before, Austen is not writing about marriage like someone who ever desires to partake in one. Missing is the meeting of like minds we see in *Pride and Prejudice,* the genuine warmth, affection, and respect, acting with the other’s best interests at heart. Colonel Brandon views Marianne as an object, a interchangeable replacement for his failed youthful infatuation. Edward is repeatedly as cruel and selfish to Elinor as he is to Lucy Steele. I started underlining each instance of the Dashwood women declaring their happiness, their luck, their good fortune. It happens at all the lowest points of the novel—when they’re exiled to Barton Park, when Elinor’s heart is broken by Edward, when Marianne’s heart is broken by Willoughby. It’s emphasized so clearly and repeatedly in contrast to their true feelings that it starts to read as a kind of manic denial on par with the [this is fine meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine), a Panglossian toxic positivity that no matter what, this is [the best of all possible worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds#18th_century).\n\nWhen the same thing happens at the end, the same insistence of happiness as its “happy” couples pair off—although, notably, it’s *Mrs. Jennings* declaring Elinor and Edward the happiest couple in the world, another warp of the text—it’s been false so many times that instead of indicating to the reader that it’s finally true, it feels unsettling, even foreboding.\n\nBecause the truth of it is… Edward doesn’t know Elinor any more than he knew Lucy, or Willoughby knew Marianne. Colonel Brandon, notably, knows Marianne even *less*—he doesn’t even have one conversation with her on the page. Repeatedly, each person only sees what they want to see, in love with a fancy in their minds. Nothing in the text indicates they aren’t repeating the same mistakes. In fact, it seems to be the point—polite society prevents any other possibility. There’s no real truth or intimacy possible when propriety takes precedence. When a few social calls before marriage is the best one can hope for, and fortune the primary goal, of course all the marriages are disastrously matched. (John and Fanny Dashwood get the best of it: they’re well-matched because they’re equally cruel and vain.)\n\nElinor’s marriage makes *Edward* happy.[^3] Marianne’s marriage (of convenience) makes *Colonel Brandon* happy. (It’s mentioned upwards of three times, including on the last page, how she is his “reward” for suffering; a rightful compensation; a transaction; all the others, even Elinor, see it this way.) Elinor and Marianne have… each other. The last paragraph dwells on their closeness, the necessary support they will give each other for the rest of their lives. \n\nThroughout the ending, as elsewhere, the text is pecuniary, often downright mercenary. After “the lovers” reunite—again, the word *lovers* is placed in other people’s mouths instead of their own, or an objective narrator—less ink is spent on their feelings than the strategy by which they must secure a living. With that focus, Austen seems to be asking, *this* is the institution that undergirds our civil society? And proceeds to make a farce of it all. \n\nI don’t begrudge anyone who wants to keep the Ang Lee version, optimistic and lovely, and practically a whole-cloth invention. I believe I’ll keep it myself, but on a different shelf from what Jane Austen actually wrote. \n\n\n\n[^1]: Actually the men were fairly easy to see anew; I had the hardest time not picturing Marianne as Kate Winslet, followed by Elinor as Emma Thompson. Which makes an enormous difference, given that Winslet was 20 and Thompson 36 when the Ang Lee adaptation was filmed. It’s bullshit that the glorious creature that is Emma Thompson got backlash for daring to play the leading lady at that age, but the fact is—that changes the story dramatically. Age is repeatedly stressed throughout the book. Elinor is bearing all of this burden, and is frequently as wrong-headed as the others, at nineteen. Marianne is barely seventeen when the book starts, barely nineteen in the footnote that’s supposed to count as her happy ending. They’re young women thrown to the wolves, impoverished by their own father, and the mature, even-tempered Thompson doesn’t quite convey those stakes.\n[^2]: For instance, as a vicar, Edward will have no home to leave to his wife and children—just like Jane’s own father.\n[^3]: Crucially, when Edward confesses and proposes, we get… none of that scene, just a paragraph focused on Edward, Edward, Edward—after multiple pages and chapters of exposing Willoughby as self-centered and foolish, Edward looks so self-centered and foolish that Willoughby nearly looks good by comparison. \n\n\n\n---\n\n## *Sense and Sensibility* in context\n\nSince this was a re-read after *[[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]],* I’m going to put my relevant highlights from that book here.\n\n\u003e In Britain, in the early nineteenth century, land was everything. If you wanted to sit on a jury, to serve as a magistrate, to vote in elections, to hunt, it was the ownership of land over a certain value that qualified you to do it. Without land, you were nothing, certainly not a fully functioning member of society. Add a desire to mimic the behavior of the aristocracy, and, on top of that, the fact that a woman’s property automatically became her husband’s when she married, unless complex legal documents were drawn up first, and it starts to become apparent why family estates were almost always left to eldest sons. Where land was power and influence, only a fool would choose to squander that influence or to see it pass into another family altogether.\n\n\u003e There are countries where it’s impossible to disinherit any of your children. In eighteenth-century England, the state was waiting to do it for you. Primogeniture amounted almost to a fetish, and firstborn sons were very nearly sacred.\n\nOn the real life parallels to Jane’s experience:\n\n\u003e No effort was made to provide the Austen girls with even the smallest of independent dowries. Cassandra inherited a little money on the death of her fiancé, enough that she would always be just about able to support herself. She’d been lucky to find a man who was willing to marry her, when she had nothing to bring to the table.\n\u003e \n\u003e Jane was penniless. Her father might have loved her, but at his death he left her nothing at all, and even before he died, he’d made her homeless.\n\n\u003e Nowhere in her surviving letters is Jane openly critical of her father or of her brothers. But in both *Sense and Sensibility* and *[[books/pride and prejudice|Pride and Prejudice]]* she permits herself to write about the carelessness, and thoughtlessness, of men who do nothing to provide for their female dependents, and to touch on female financial anxiety and the psychological pressures of being beholden to more fortunate relations.\n\n\u003e This is the first instance of a sibling pattern that we see repeated over and over again in the novel—a pattern of two brothers and a sister. It’s so neat a way of examining the question of inheritance that it looks very much as if it must be design.\n\n\u003e The opening chapter is bewildering because the concept it describes is. ==Jane is making explicit a deeply held (and deeply inconsistent) cultural belief—that women, the very people who are supposed to spend their life at home, in the bosom of their families, don’t really belong there.== Whatever the domestic contribution of the Dashwood women—the “solid comfort” and “cheerfulness” they have provided, the “attention” they have given—it’s worth nothing at all; its “value” can easily be outweighed, ignored, dismissed. Behind Elinor and Marianne and Margaret and their mother are a whole imaginary army of others, generations of them, a disinherited multitude of Dashwoods both male and female.\n\n\u003e Wollstonecraft was subjected to a vicious character assassination after her death in 1797. Even before her death, her illicit relationship with the anarchist philosopher William Godwin had put her firmly in the sights of conservative thinkers. If *Sense and Sensibility* is a work of the 1790s or very early nineteenth century, then it looks as if it were written as a deliberately and self-consciously feminist one. By 1811, of course, that effect would have been muted for a fair portion of readers who were less familiar with Wollstonecraft.\n\n\u003e ==What we can say is that Sense and Sensibility, even in 1811, would have been read as a novel about property and inheritance—about greed and need and the terrible, selfish things that families do to each other for the sake of money.==\n\n\u003e Lucy Steele—later Ferrars and so doubly metallic—is thrice described as “sharp.” Characters “cut” their acquaintances, refuse to acknowledge that they are acquainted, a word that doesn’t appear in this context in Jane’s other novels.\n\n\u003e Jane is less interested in psychological plausibility here, I think, than in resolving the plot: Robert’s sudden acquisition of wealth and independence wins him the affections of Edward’s practical-minded betrothed, Lucy Steele, freeing Edward to marry Elinor. But it also shows how arbitrary and absurd it is to concentrate resources on any one child to the disadvantage of the others, how unnatural. Nearly every character in the novel is taken aback at Mrs. Ferrars’s decision to make Robert “to all intents and purposes…the eldest,” at “so unfair a division of his mother’s love and liberality”; there’s much talk of how unfortunate Edward is, of how unkind his family is being to him. This, though, is exactly what primogeniture always did: it’s a zero-sum game.\n\n\u003e No reader who was familiar with *Udolpho* would have been surprised to discover that Willoughby is a weak-willed, sexually inconstant gambler who gets himself into debt; the difference between him and Valancourt is that Jane doesn’t subscribe to the comforting notion that a sinner can be reformed by love—or that he ought to be.\n\n\u003e Happy endings, truly happy ones, are in short supply in this novel.\n\n\u003e This isn’t enough to marry on. Mrs. Dashwood is in no position to advance them any money; the only way for them to marry is for Edward to appeal to his mother. She, grudgingly, gives him £10,000, the same sum “which had been given with Fanny.” Edward isn’t just made into a younger son; he’s made into a daughter.\n\u003e \n\u003e Still, thanks to Edward’s mother, he and Elinor will have an extra £500 a year, making £850 altogether. It’s a perfectly adequate income. But it falls short of the “wealth” without which “every kind of external comfort must be wanting.” They’ll be able to afford servants, perhaps a carriage, but they will struggle to send their sons to school or university, to set them up in careers. They’re unlikely to be able to provide dowries for any daughters, certainly not extensive ones. And as a vicar, Edward will have no home to leave to his wife and children—just like Jane’s own father.\n\n\u003e It’s a tendency Edward shares with Willoughby, this ability to always find someone to blame. It’s not the only similarity between the two characters, in spite of their apparent positioning as opposites.\n\n\u003e Both encourage one of the Dashwood sisters to believe that they are interested in marrying them, and Jane makes a point of showing us that it isn’t just Marianne and Elinor who are misled but almost everyone who observes the two couples together. It’s arguable as to which man behaves worse in this regard. Whatever Willoughby intended at the beginning, there was a period when, he says, “I felt my intentions were strictly honourable.” Edward knows, right up until nearly the end of the novel, that he’s engaged to another woman. He’s not in a position to have proper intentions toward Elinor. Both men indulge their own vanity, and their own feelings, without much regard for the women they claim to love.\n\n\u003e Willoughby and Edward are deceivers, capable of lying to mothers, lovers, sisters. All the way through the novel, a careful reader can see that Jane suggests reserving judgment about people. Someone may seem or appear a certain way; what they really are is harder to ascertain. Almost every page reveals sentences that, on a second reading, hesitate, equivocate.\n\n\u003e Over the course of *Sense and Sensibility,* readers learn enough about Edward to doubt his sense, and perhaps his goodness too; we realize that it’s more than just “shyness” concealing his “understanding and principles.”\n\n\u003e There are far more secrets in *Sense and Sensibility* than in any of Jane’s other novels. There are also confessions, and the person who receives nearly all of them is Elinor. The contortions Jane has to go through in order to make this happen suggest that it’s important, perhaps because we’re meant to be holding this pronouncement of hers in mind. What people “say of themselves” shouldn’t be used as a guide “without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge.”\n\n\u003e Jane puts three male romantic interests into the novel. Given that two of them spend large portions of time lying, and conceal dark secrets in their romantic and sexual pasts, we’re well within our rights to ask a few hard questions about Colonel Brandon.\n\n\u003e The age difference wouldn’t have been as troubling for Jane’s first readers as it is for us, however. What they were much more likely to be troubled by is the colonel’s connection with India.\n\u003e \n\u003e The East India Company essentially gained Britain a vast imperial holding on the cheap. But public opinion was hostile. British men who returned home, having gained fortunes in India, were referred to, scornfully, as “nabobs,” a corruption of the Urdu nawab. The company’s rule was seen as corrupt and corrupting, even criminal.\n\n\u003e But whatever Jane’s family connections and family loyalties might have been, she can hardly have avoided knowing that for the majority of her readers a reference to India would have been a black mark, a reminder of corruption, of avarice. Brandon is tainted by association. She could easily have avoided it, either by not mentioning where Brandon had been or by replacing the “East Indies” with somewhere like Canada. She doesn’t.\n\n\u003e If one sets aside the insistent egoism apparent in the colonel’s story (just look at all the instances of “I” and “my” in it), it never seems to enter his head that perhaps he ought to be saving up as much money as he can to give to his ward—to replace, in some measure, the fortune that was effectively stolen from her mother and used to prop up the estate.\n\n\u003e We can’t be certain, but there’s room for doubt—doubt about Colonel Brandon’s morals, his motivations. Doubt, ultimately, about whether Marianne can ever really be happy with a man who, if he doesn’t quite steal the bread out of the mouths of his daughter and granddaughter, is happy to enrich himself from the fortune that, morally, ought to belong to his female relations.\n\n\u003e We’re never shown the two in conversation together. The one time we see Marianne actually address a comment to the colonel, he doesn’t reply. Even toward the end of the novel, there are no more than a couple of indirect references to their exchanging very basic courtesies.\n\n\u003e For [[authors/mary wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], it was self-evident that sensibility, in exciting women’s feelings, particularly their sexual feelings, would be a lifelong burden. As she says, “A husband cannot long pay those attentions with the passion necessary to excite lively emotions, and the heart, accustomed to lively emotions, turns to a new lover, or pines in secret, the prey of virtue or prudence.”\n\n\u003e ==In the world of Sense and Sensibility love and family, honor and duty, have hardly any meaning. Promises are made to be broken. Women are exiled from their homes. Guardians don’t guard. Brothers ignore their sisters, mothers disinherit their sons, fathers fail to safeguard their daughters.==\n\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/sensoria":{"title":"Sensoria","content":"\n- The tragic side of life is never far away.

But this use misses the deepest function of myth, which is to lend narrative order to apparently disconnected bits of information, the way constellations group impossibly distant stars into tight, easily recognizable patterns that are simultaneously imaginary and real.\n\n\u003e This is a curious notion of productivity—at once overtly political and yet presented innocently enough, as if there were only one possible meaning of “productivity.” This perspective on life incorporates the Protestant work ethic (that “productivity” is what makes an animal “effective”) and echoes the Old Testament notion that life must be endured, not enjoyed. These assumptions are embedded throughout the literature of evolutionary psychology. Ethologist/primatologist Frans de Waal, one of the more open-minded philosophers of human nature, calls this ==Calvinist sociobiology==.\n\n\u003e Recognized as a way to build and maintain a network of mutually beneficial relationships, nonreproductive sex no longer requires special explanations. Homosexuality, for example, becomes far less confusing, in that it is, as E. O. Wilson has written, “above all a form of bonding…consistent with the greater part of heterosexual behavior as a device that cements relationships.”\n\n\u003e If the independent, isolated nuclear family unit is, in fact, the structure into which human beings most naturally configure themselves, why do contemporary societies and religions find it necessary to prop it up with tax breaks and supportive legislation while fiercely defending it from same-sex couples and others proposing to marry in supposedly “nontraditional” ways? One wonders, in fact, why marriage is a legal issue at all—apart from its relevance to immigration and property laws. Why would something so integral to human nature require such vigilant legal protection?\n\n\u003e [[authors/thomas hobbes|Hobbes]] took the madness of his age, considered it “normal,” and projected it back into prehistoric epochs of which he knew next to nothing. What Hobbes called “human nature” was a projection of seventeenth-century Europe, where life for most was rough, to put it mildly. Though it has persisted for centuries, Hobbes’s dark fantasy of prehistoric human life is as valid as grand conclusions about Siberian wolves based on observations of stray dogs in Tijuana. (cf. *[[books/humankind|Humankind: A Hopeful History]]*)\n\n\u003e Asking whether our species is naturally peaceful or warlike, generous or possessive, free-loving or jealous, is like asking whether H2O is naturally a solid, liquid, or gas. ==The only meaningful answer to such a question is: It depends.== On a nearly empty planet, with food and shelter distributed widely, avoiding conflict would have been an easy, attractive option. Under the conditions typical of ancestral environments, human beings would have had much more to lose than to gain from warring against one another. The evidence—both physical and circumstantial—points to a human prehistory in which our ancestors made far more love than war.\n\n\u003e The conditions necessary for devastating epidemics or pandemics just didn’t exist until the agricultural revolution. The claim that modern medicine and sanitation save us from infectious diseases that ravaged pre-agricultural people (something we hear often) is like arguing that seat belts and air bags protect us from car crashes that were fatal to our prehistoric ancestors.\n\n\u003e How many beavers die in dam-construction accidents? Are birds subject to sudden spells of vertigo that send them falling from the sky? How many fish drown to death? Such events are all rather infrequent we’d wager, but the toll exacted upon humans by the chronic stress many consider a normal part of human life is massive.\n\n\u003e Before the war on drugs, the war on terror, or the war on cancer, there was the war on female sexual desire. It’s a war that has been raging far longer than any other, and its victims number well into the billions by now. Like the others, it’s a war that can never be won, as the declared enemy is a force of nature. We may as well declare war on the cycles of the moon.\n\n\u003e To Meredith Small, the story of the female’s role in conception is a miniature of the overall narrative. She sees the popular understanding of conception as “an outdated allegory of human sexuality” featuring the male as “aggressor, persuader, conqueror.” Recent research on human fertilization suggests something of a role reversal. Small suggests the ovum “reaches out and envelops reluctant sperm.” “Female biology,” she concludes, “even at the level of egg and sperm interaction, doesn’t necessarily dictate a docile stance.” (cf. *[[books/the woman in the body|The Woman in the Body]]*)\n\n\u003e Sexologist Lisa Diamond spent over a decade studying the ebb and flow of female desire. In her book Sexual Fluidity, she reports that many women see themselves as attracted to specific people, rather than to their gender. Women, in Diamond’s view, respond so strongly to emotional intimacy that their innate gender orientation can easily be overwhelmed. Chivers agrees: “Women physically don’t seem to differentiate between genders in their sex responses, at least heterosexual women don’t.” (interesting if true?? cf. [[notes/our sense of the erotic is more plastic than we think|our sense of the erotic is more plastic than we think]])\n\n\u003e ==Much of recent history can be seen as waves of tolerance and acceptance breaking against the rocky headlands of rigid social structures. Though it can seem to take almost forever, the waves always win in the end, reducing immobile rock to shifting sand.==\n\n\u003e Author Andrew Sullivan described his experience growing up both gay and Catholic as “difficult to the point of agony. I saw in my own life and those of countless others,” Sullivan recalled, “that the suppression of these core emotions and the denial of their resolution in love always always leads to personal distortion and compulsion and loss of perspective. Forcing…people into molds they do not fit helps no one,” Sullivan wrote. “It robs them of dignity and self-worth and the capacity for healthy relationships. It wrecks family, twists Christianity, violates humanity. It must end.”\n\n\u003e Despite centuries of religious and scientific propaganda, the basic illusions underpinning the supposed “naturalness” of the conventional nuclear family are clearly exhausted. This collapse has left many of us isolated and unfulfilled. ==Blind insistence and well-intentioned inquisitions have failed to turn the tide, and show no signs of future success.== (cf. [[notes/naturalistic fallacy|naturalistic fallacy]])\n\n\u003e People often say to us, “But we’re human beings. We can *choose* how to behave.” That’s true, to a certain extent, but our bodies rebel against decisions that go against our evolved nature. You can *choose* to wear shoes that are too small, but you can’t choose to be comfortable in them. You can *choose* to wear a corset, but you may well pass out because you can’t breathe properly…. The human body and mind have evolved for a certain kind of life. The further we diverge from that path, the greater the cost in terms of mental, emotional, and physical health.\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/shadow-claw":{"title":"Shadow \u0026 Claw","content":"I think a series that has its own [[books/lexicon urthus|lexicon]] counts for the ultimate feat of [[notes/puzzle-book worldbuilding|puzzle-book worldbuilding]].","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/shadows-and-dreams":{"title":"Shadows \u0026 Dreams","content":"I’m almost sad I did this in audio because there are SO MANY lines I would have copy-pasted.

Together they embark on the worst ~~elopement~~ ~~kidnapping~~ elopement in history (per Belle, it’s not vainglorious to claim that when it’s true), and what ensues is a meditation on friendship, love, sexuality, identity, self-discovery, society, and *home* in a way that only Alexis Hall can do it. There’s a meet-cute with a highwayman just responding to a personals ad; Belle’s dalliance with Sir Horley’s theologically-inclined jilted fiancé; a wayward, thieving steward who just needs some kink, care, and tenderness; and through it all, the rock solid foundation of trust and support Belle and ~~Sir Horley~~ Rufus start to build for themselves. \n\nWhen I heard they were going to be the pairing, I was giddy with delight. When I read the last line, I was giddy with delight. I’m on record with Sir Horley stealing my heart in the first book, and Belle lowkey having the best background arc in the second. There was rich soil to till there, and still Alexis Hall surprised me at every turn. I’ve yearned for YEARS for a friendship to get the full romance novel treatment, not as something inferior or less interesting or a detour on the way to romance, and he delivers that in ~~fabulous~~ ~~spectacular~~ extraordinary fashion.\n\nIf anything, this third book is the necessary capstone to the rest. *[[books/something fabulous|Something Fabulous]]* is quite focused and selfish; *[[books/something spectacular|Something Spectacular]]* embraces a larger, weirder family; *Something Extraordinary* asks what that even *means* and bares its heart to the world. \n\nI was lucky to get an ARC, so I can’t add my usual wall of quotes until it’s published in December. But I will be re-reading then, and if the first two books are any indication, for many times to come, whenever I need belly laughs and a balm for my soul. \n\nP.S. Reading this back to back with *[[books/liars|Liars]]*, I can’t help noting how it deconstructs the entire patriarchal shambles and arms its various lovers with knowledge, agency, and solidarity. When one can’t yet change the system, that’s the way to prevent misery and abuse. A starker contrast there couldn’t be, both of them telling a different side of the truth. \n\nP.P.S. Peggy and Orfeo’s (and Bonny’s) adorable terror of an offspring makes an appearance and gets told she’s  “something important” by Belle. If that becomes a fourth installment in the future about the second generation of Delanceys and Tarletons, I am here for it. \n\n*ARC kindly provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/something-fabulous":{"title":"Something Fabulous","content":"So far the theme of the year is romances that I read and then re-read right away and install on my best-of-year list (best-of-ever list too, in the case of *Something Fabulous*, which more than lives up to its name).\n\nA few notes:  \n\n1. We’re starting to see the books written during the pandemic where authors are writing what they WANT, not what they SHOULD. It happened here, it happened with *[[books/delilah green doesn't care|Delilah Green]]*—it’s a joy and it changes the shape of the story in ways I want to see more of. \n\n2. Valentine with the slow realization he’s the villain of his own story is such a necessary twist, and one I hope we see more of, especially in historical fiction, especially with dukes.\n\n3. The way Alexis Hall removes the obstacles he’s set up to the romance is a deft touch and perfect in a queer book that has to invent its own happy ending. Most if not all of them are in Valentine’s head, and doing away with them involves listening instead of making assumptions + rethinking what’s possible outside the chokehold of convention.\n\n4. The JOY in this book. It’s one bananas gothic trope after another, and it’s riffing on the joy and power of stories, the way they save our lives. See again: pandemic fiction. ♥️\n\n5. I wrote a post recently about what it feels like to find out there’s a word for what you are and that others like you exist, and Valentine—his chaotic distress, indignant grief, baffled anger, and disorienting joy—might be the most relatable portrayal I’ve read yet. (Well, except for all the parts where he’s going, but I AM A DUKE.)\n\n\u003e _“Nobody told me it was a possibility.” Valentine suddenly discovered he was quite aggrieved. “Why has this never been brought to my attention?”_ \n\nSo yes, that made the book very very special to me, with whole pages I wanted to tear out and curl up with like blankets. Um... metaphorically? That makes sense, right? Anyway—zany tropes, real emotion.

But that will have to happen one day—I can’t get my brain to arrange it. For now, I’ll make do with a bunch of exclamations and quotes.\n\nValentine!\n\n\u003e Valentine—who, due to what Peggy presumed was ducal inexperience of manual labour, had still to learn that the best thing to do in a hole was stop digging.\n\nBonny!\n\n\u003e “Oh my God.” Bonny threw his arms wide in despair. “You people have no emotional stamina.

But just like the first book, all the zany drama is grounded in very real and deep emotion, and I want to end on the note of how deeply Peggy affected me, forging her own path through the world, heart wide open because of all those who have opened their hearts to her. \n\n\u003e Because if Peggy had to step to the front of the stage and deliver an aria from the depths of her heart, it would probably go something like:  \n\u003e \n\u003e _I am mildly conflicted about my life sometimes_  \n\u003e _And it is hard to know how to be yourself_  \n\u003e _When everything in the world is full of other people’s ideas_  \n\u003e _About what things are and mean._  \n\u003e _But mostly I am very lucky with the people who love me_  \n\u003e _And fine.

I thought I had finally found the holy grail, cycling fiction (nay, romance!) that gets the cycling facts correct. The dedication is to Wouter Weylandt(!), there’s a glossary of French terms and race classifications, and four pages in she’s name-dropping Garmin-Sharp and Fausto Coppi. My expectations, below sea level, started to gain elevation.\n\nEnergy gels taste like “chemical fruit with the consistency of semen.” (lol.) Her Italian cyclist knows English, French, German, Spanish, and “enough Flemish to insult Belgian riders—it’s important to insult them so they understand.” (Ha! Accurate to message boards I’ve been on.) Pillow talk is Contador, Pantani, and Big Mig. 10/10, no notes. 👌\n\nAnd then. And then.\n\nI’m honestly baffled as to how an author could research enough to get the above details correct, yet have it go so wrong. By chapter 5, I was side-eyeing a couple things. By chapter 14, my rant-notes were getting extensive. By chapter 21, I had so many WTFs that I wrote myself the note to “walk it off, Jamie, walk it off”… and then I did, taking a few laps around the room to cool down.\n\nShe fundamentally misunderstands the most basic race dynamics, not to mention the types of disciplines involved in cycling, in a way that negates the emotional impact of the story. She wants me to think Luca is struggling to prove himself while tossing off asides about him winning the biggest races in the world like it’s no big deal. She wants me to feel these big feelings about things that could never happen to Luca’s career. She forgoes the very real struggles and dangers of being a pro cyclist in favor of nonsensical melodrama.\n\nIn a weird way, I’m less annoyed when a writer is phoning it in. To put this much effort into a well-researched book while botching the most obvious, basic fundamentals of the sport is orders of magnitude more disappointing. And if it had less real-life touchstones, then I could handwave more of the errors as a reality-adjacent fantasy. \n\nI’ve established with previous attempts at [[books/the black jersey|cycling fiction]] and [[books/racing to you|romance]] that what a cycling fan wants is to be entertained and to nitpick. There was so much of the latter it ruined the former, and by the time she had botched the Giro beyond recognition (my beloved Giro!!) and had the antagonist *DIE OF A BROKEN COLLARBONE,* I could not. I was rooting against the couple out of spite and nothing could redeem it.\n\nFor the brave or the foolish, I’ve copied my raw notes below, with a few addendums. I made it to the end, so allow me to indulge in the pleasure of WTF-ing all over the place with my 20 years of nutso cycling fan bonafides.\n\n---\n\n## Raw notes\n\n“Are those [the Garmin-Sharp guys](https://www.procyclingstats.com/team/garmin-sharp-2013/overview/)?” as they train in Colorado (ok, so we’re doing this! 2013 nostalgia here we come \\#danmartinletsgoooo)\n\n\u003e “I call to see if you’re okay after the ride.”\n\u003e No, okay was not the first thought that sprang to mind. “Hit by a truck”, “pounded by hammers”, or “face first into the wall” were all more accurate than “okay.”\n\u003e “I’ll live.”\n  \n^^ hahahaha\n\nHe wins the white jersey at Flèche Wallone… noooo. Flèche is a one-day race, no jerseys awarded. And Chris says this while trying to prove his cycling cred and that he’s not one of *those fans* who only follow the TDF 🙃\n\nWhoa, fatal impact—now I see why it’s dedicated to Weylandt. That was well done, harrowing and emotional\n\nDriedaagse van West Vlaanderen! (aka Three Days of West Flanders, which morphed into [Dwars door West-Vlaanderen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwars_door_West-Vlaanderen), aka Tour of West Flanders, then ceased to exist after 2018.

Me, reading this whole chapter thinking that Luca’s on a continental team and thus his career is much worse off than I thought 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nAll due respect to Driedaagse van West Vlaanderen, but there is NO WAY a stacked startlist with the World Champ, Olympic time trial champ,[^1] and GC guys are at this little 2.2 race[^2] \n(It’s so easy to fact check too! Here’s [the startlist for 2013](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/3daagse-van-west-vlaanderen/2013/startlist): it’s all classics riders and sprinters—namely Cav—prepping for Tirreno)\n\n“So what if it was a second tier stage race? That only meant more national and regional teams mixed in with all the top level pros.” Chris is reallllly not arguing his case for having any cycling cred here\n\nThrowing shade at the brown kit of La Mondiale—ahh, the hallowed cycling tradition 🤣 \n\nDay two of Driedaagse: winning breakaway goes at 12k, Luca the *climber* winning a reduced *sprint* of eight or so guys… with a one second gap on the Herelbeke circuit 🙃\nDay three is another last minute breakaway with a sprint against “the olympian” 🙃\n(No, this would not happen.)\n\nObligatory carbon fiber erection joke lol\nCasually namedropping Fabian (Cancellara), Jens (Voigt), and Damiano (Caruso? or Cunego?)\n\nDriedaagse De Panne-Koksijde!

That's going to be some pull, and it's the second time the riders will see it today.” The announcer offered words of doom—even the Super-Jamestown route didn’t have anything over a 14% grade. Luca and the others would be going the next thing to straight up.\n\n^^ Ok, um, NO. She acts like this is *rampas inhumanas* at the Vuelta! [Berendries is a b-roll berg in the Ardennes](https://thechainstay.com/blog/2012/04/monumental-bergs-the-berendries/), which would hurt the legs for sure but it’s not a climb for climbers, and hardly a deterrent for most sprinters. [Stage 1 of the 2013 Driedaagse De Panne-Koksijde](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/classic-brugge-de-panne/2013/stage-1) did 3 laps that included the Berendries, and it was won in a sprint by a sprinter/all-rounder without a climber in sight\n\nInvoking [Johnny Hoogerland and the barbed wire heard round the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJEtNfnDLCk) (although she says Hoogerland hit by the car, and *actually* it was Flecha hit by the car, then Hoogerland sent flying by the chain reaction… but that’s close enough)\n\nLuca has his lead “whittled down to a minute”—this is not the TDF!![^3]\nThe other stars backing out on the last day bc they’re poor losers 🙄\nBahahaha NO. Again, the big stars would not be there in the first place, but these are athletes who [won’t abandon with a broken tibia](https://web.archive.org/web/20140717050145/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/sports/cycling/alberto-contador-is-latest-to-crash-out-of-tour-de-france.html). That’s not how cycling works anyway, one crash or puncture for the leader and it’s all over. Pogacǎr had a 10 min lead at this year’s Giro and was still worried about losing it on the last day. \n\n“If he was racing, and he took Paris-Roubaix in a brutal group sprint, there would be a single line to announce the real story afterwards.” !!!!! \nWinning Roubaix no big deal???! In a GROUP SPRINT no less?? WTF \nWins Flèche Wallonne!!! Ardennes and cobbles are different types of classics for different types of riders!\nIf he can do that, ON TOP OF WINNING ROUBAIX, he wouldn’t be proving he can be the star instead of domestique, he’d be a once in a generation legend!!!!!\n(It *is* more correct for a GC guy to win Flèche though, instead of Roubaix)\n\nI think she thinks more stages = level of importance?? So one-day races aren’t a big deal?\n\nAww, Davis Phinney! Also name-dropping Wiggins, Spartacus, Nibali\nShe’s good at naming her teams—we’ve got Mondiale, Euskatel-Euskadi, Argos-Shimano, Lampre, Cannondale, and Team Sky, all IRL teams, and she adds Antano-Clark, Kastibank, and Duclos-Wurth, which blends right in (there was actually an [Astana-Würth and Liberty Seguros–Würth team circa 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONCE_(cycling_team)))\n\nLuca, a climber, in a breakaway (!!!) with 2.5 min (!!!!!) on stage 1 circuit (!!!!!!) in Naples 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️\nCheck [the stage 1 circuit in Naples in the IRL 2013 Giro](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/giro-d-italia/2013/stage-1): won by Cav (A SPRINTER) in a flat group sprint\nOver 15 KOM points on a hill in the city 🤦🏻‍♀️\nBobke and Phil commentating the Giro??? hahahaha I remember watching this Giro—I was learning Dutch so I could pirate the stream from Sporza bc [the USA is notoriously bad about covering any race](https://cyclocosm.com/2013/03/why-americans-cant-watch-cycling-on-tv/) that’s not the Tour de France[^4]\nChris is *in Italy*—how would he even be streaming that coverage anyway instead of Eurosport or RAI??\n\nLuca and his super-domestique winning one-two, hand in hand, on the opening fucking SPRINT STAGE\nGets pseudo-arrested immediately after winning the sprint for doping suspicion !!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️\nWalk it off Jamie, walk it off\n\n(I mean yeah, he’s on something nuclear if a climber is winning sprints from a breakaway, but an Italian cyclist in Italy getting publicly humiliated… this is just drama for the sake of drama, and it’s stupid)\n\nOk this is partly just recreating [the 2013 Giro](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/giro-d-italia/2013): Naples, TTT on day 2, then Sorrento, Matera, Pescara, Saltera, Firenze\n\nLuca winning or finishing in the top 5 on next 5 stages 🤦🏻‍♀️\nLet me be clear: sprint stages and mountain stages are basically a different sport\nSprinters and climbers are different [types of cyclists](https://biketips.com/types-of-cyclists-in-road-cycling-explained/) with completely different physiques\nShe’s popping Luca in all these different scenarios like he could win a sprint or a breakaway or a TT or a climb and that’s bananas!

Not cool!\n“Berto, Brad, Vincenzo e Damiano” worried \nName on the back of his jersey? But cyclists don’t have names on the back of their jerseys. Or is this like that time [Team Sky tried it](https://cycling.today/team-sky-unveil-new-kit-for-2018/) but got in trouble with the UCI?\n[Bruyneel—but this is during/after his scandal??!](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=johan+bruyneel+scandal)\nLuca caught in 50 man pileup, Chris (A SPECTATOR!) goes rogue to pace him up the mountain\nwhat the actual fuck am I reading\nRolf dies ok nope\nDIED FROM A BROKEN COLLARBONE\n\nVisiting the memorial at [il Santuario della Madonna del Ghisallo](https://www.santuariomadonnadelghisallo.it/en/the-history-of-the-sanctuary-of-the-madonna-del-ghisallo/)—this part is touching, but I’m so salty I can’t appreciate it bc Rolf DIED FROM A BROKEN COLLARBONE\n\nOf all the injuries?! Why pick the one injury that can’t be fatal unless it’s from like… surgical complications and infection?! 😭\nAnd now I’m retroactively salty at the first road fatality back when Chris’s friend died because this is such a dumb repeat of a tragedy, it undermines the genuine emotional impact\n\nThis is petty now, but it irks me that braincell-deprived Christopher is the only one who notices the sprinter’s bike is geared wrong for climbing. Gearing fuckups happen, sure, but trust me that any sprinter who so much as sneezes in the direction of the Alps, much less climbs \\*checks notes\\* [MONT ZONCOLAN](https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/the-zoncolan-one-of-the-most-feared-climbs-in-cycling), will know to not over-gear their bike, as will every mechanic, teammate, DS, commentator, and most fans of the race. It will not require a cycling newb from a Colorado bike shop to have this brainstorm. \nTHIS IS ALSO WHY SPRINTERS CANNOT WIN CLIMBS AND CLIMBERS CANNOT WIN SPRINTS \n\nAt this point, I can’t tell if I’m rooting against them out of spite, or if I’m like, sure why not, these two dumbasses deserve each other \n\n\u003e “You're as strong a man as Johan Bruyneel. And almost as crazy.” Bruyneel would understand exactly why Luca completed Mont Zoncolan.\n\n^^ Not… the hero you want? 😳\n\n(Worth noting: circa 2012–13, the Garmin-Sharp teammates were testifying for USADA against Armstrong. Bruyneel banned by 2014. None of that circus is really acknowledged. Main comment about Armstrong is that he mashed the pedals.)\n\nAnd now… Vincenzo Nibali wins the Giro as god intended. Fucking finally.\n\nWhat’s wild to me is if you know enough to accurately include Nibali in your book, an Italian climber who wins in the Giro in 2013, then use [his palmares](https://www.procyclingstats.com/rider/vincenzo-nibali/2013) as the template for your fictional cyclist, an Italian climber who aims to win the Giro in 2013. See what races Nibali does as prep (note: NOT the Flemish classics!!), and more importantly, what types of stages and races he wins. Ta-daa! It’s like a cheatsheet for how to create accurate drama, not name-dropping Big Mig but then botching your whole cycling cred by having your climber win Roubaix and every sprint in sight 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\n[^1]: If it’s circa 2013, hi Brad Wiggins! 👋\n[^2]: She says 2.1, but it’s 2.2—a legit typo, because she already explained [the different classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications) in the glossary\n[^3]: Again, super easy to fact check: the gap between first and second in [the final 2013 GC](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/classic-brugge-de-panne/2013/gc) is a measly 22 seconds, the largest gap of the race, and typical for this type of race\n[4]: This more than anything is the giveaway that you’re an American who has only watched the Tour, despite all protests to the contrary 🙃","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/starling-house":{"title":"Starling House","content":"After burning out on southern gothic, it delights me when there are authors that make it fresh again, doing something fun in the genre.\n  \nHere’s how you write horror in Kentucky.

And I realized, I still hadn’t come up with words to talk about it yet, how the first two books of the series encapsulate 2020 for me in a specific and uncanny way, a century past the series’ historical setting, the same kinds of stresses and shifts going on in the world, and now the third installment does the same with 2021. \n\nIt IS the 2021 mood for me, in so many respects. Okay, but not okay. Out of the woods, but not yet. Boredom, but chaos. One day at a time. The ground not exactly steady under anyone’s feet. \n\nBut also the glimmer of sunlight a long way down the tunnel. The cracks and the fissures. The exhale. The shift. The amount of vulnerability and love packed in the “I’ve wondered where you were hiding the damage” scene is three books worth of payoff and it’s made me cry each time I’ve read it. I’ve never identified with Will more. And yet with all the serious stakes, the book sparkles like Phoebe walking into a room, radiating joy and goodwill. \n \nI don’t know how KJ Charles does it. Much less how she did it during this year. She dug deep, and it shows, an emotional depth that I dare say surpasses even what she’s written before. Just Kim’s transformation alone is gorgeous. Several times I kept thinking, who are you, and what have you done with Lord Arthur Aloysius Kimberly de Brabazon Secretan? In the best way, because he’s still utterly Kim, the true Kim at the core. \n\nI do need to state one final thing: my undying devotion for a book that FINALLY makes the threat of an inherited title the worst possible outcome to be avoided at all costs. She takes the marriage of convenience trope (darling, we must commit ourselves prematurely to secure title, wealth, and societal approval) and does the inverse (Darling, we must rid ourselves of this blight at all costs because it will quite literally be the end of life and love as we know it and the only way we’ll be whole and healthy is to refuse to participate). \n\nI keep thinking, this is what happens when you really queer history. Or, eh, queer the pulp fiction version of it anyway. You get to consider the inverse of things. Disrupt the idea, for one, that love = possession, or that there’s any scarcity in it. Explore the margins. Question the narrative. Rethink a few key assumptions. Step outside prescribed roles. See what else is possible when guided by tenderness and vulnerability, instead of propriety and power.\n\nWhat other tropes—what other trajectories of history—what other scripts that we follow—could be turned upside down?","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/sword-citadel":{"title":"Sword \u0026 Citadel","content":"Ugh, my [[notes/puzzle-book worldbuilding|puzzle-loving brain]] absolutely loved this.

Reading them side by side: Mitchell’s version is what we expect spiritual texts to be; Le Guin’s is what spiritual texts _should_ be.\n\nIn the introduction, he says he played with the text, but there’s very little playfulness involved. He also claims to exhort femininity, but the main way he does this is just by swapping ‘she’ for ‘he’ at various points. (Where neither is necessary; note how Le Guin fails to need either, which is truer to the original text.)\n\nAlso, he’s very quick to denounce that _wei wu wei_ could be passivity. Oh no! It’s like an athlete! Le Guin, in contrast, isn’t scared off by passivity (see also: *[[books/the lathe of heaven|Lathe of Heaven]]*).\n\nHis metaphor is an athlete “in the zone”; hers is a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers: “uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force.” Note the profound difference in those images.\n\nIncidentally, Le Guin comments on Mitchell’s translation, which I had forgotten and didn’t find again until I read her translation notes at the end of the book. It’s one of the versions that blur the language into dullness and vagueness, she says. “Lao Tzu is tough-minded. He is tender-minded. He is never, under any circumstances, squashy-minded. By confusing mysticism with imprecision, such versions betray the spirit of the book and its marvelously pungent, laconic, beautiful language.”\n\nIndeed.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/tao-the-watercourse-way":{"title":"Tao: The Watercourse Way","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/taoism":{"title":"Taoism","content":"As of 1997, [[authors/ursula k le guin|Le Guin]] could claim that the best, soundest, clearest introduction and guide to taoism is still Holmes Welch’s *Taoism: The Parting of the Way.* (per her translation of the [[books/tao te ching|Tao Te Ching]])\n\nEven where the text is dated, I find it hard to disagree.\n\n---\n## Raw notes\n\n- To read is an act of creation\n- The Tao Te Ching: We cannot be certain what it means. We never will be.\n- It’s the magic mirror, reflecting what the reader seeks\n- Baffles and irritates orthodox minds\n- Zen owes much to Taoism\n- The nonexistence of absolutes, the nonexistence of contraries\n- To act without action\n- The cyclical pattern of change\n\n\u003e Unvaryingly the wheel turns; what goes up must come down. Victories lead in the end to defeat, force to weakness, laws to lawlessness, good to evil—all because, as Fung puts it, “if any one thing moves to an extreme in one direction, a change must bring the opposite result.”\n\n- Learn how to unlearn\n\n\u003e This came to be called the “Period of the Fighting States.” China seemed to be spinning down a whirlpool of ruin. To the people of the fighting states, as to some people today, it appeared that the world—the known world—must finish as a wasteland.\n\u003e \n\u003e These were the times in which Lao Tzu lived.\n\n\u003e Lao Tzu rejected the Confucian answer. Indeed, he probably believed that Confucius was the person who had triggered China’s decline by preaching morality. Lao Tzu’s answer was the doctrine of inaction, or, in Chinese, [[notes/flow, don’t force|wu wei (literally, “not doing”)]]. In his opinion the best method of coping with pillage, tyranny, and slaughter was to do nothing about them.\n\n“Not doing” in a special sense, of course: \n- “Weapons are wont to rebound” (30W)\n- “The more laws you make, the more thieves there will be” (57)\n- “The sage does not boast, and is therefore given credit” (22)\n- “He who acts harms, he who grabs lets slip” (64W)\n\nThe principle underlying this: \n\n\u003e In human relations force defeats itself. Every action produces a reaction, every challenge a response. \n\n- Evolution might be thought of as a march towards ever more highly articulated and effective capacity for resistance\n- ==So when anyone, ruler or subject, tries to act upon humans individually or collectively, the ultimate result is the opposite of what he is aiming at== (Law of Aggression)\n- wu wei—“to yield is to be preserved whole, because the wise man does not contend no one can contend against him”\n- Doing nothing, yet achieving everything\n- How can inaction succeed? By being rather by doing, by attitude rather than act, by attraction rather than compulsion\n\n\u003e Lao Tzu recognized that we intuitively sense one another’s feelings, and that my attitude, rather than my acts, is the determining factor in your attitude and your acts.\n\n- Having a concept of good leads to having a concept of evil, which leads to combatting evil, which only makes evil stronger\n- Good done to one person may be evil to another\n- Everyone is telling the truth—if you can only understand it\n- The regret which legitimizes the use of force is a cardinal point of taoism\n\n- Lao Tzu believes that man’s original nature was kind and mild, and that it became aggressive as a reaction to the force of legal and moral codes (ie Confucianism)\n- That’s the basis for statements like, “banish human kindness, discard morality, and the people will become dutiful and compassionate” \n- Confucian morality with its 3,300 rules of etiquette—this makes hypocrites of men who were once simple-hearted, for they outwardly conform while they inwardly rebel \n\t- ((if Wei Ying was consciously modeled on taoist principles in *[[series/mo dao zu shi novel|Mó Dào Zǔ Shī]],* I bet the Lan Clan’s 3000 rules was modeled on confucianism? The whole outward/inward contrast of morality + the failure of those rules to provide justice pretty much tracks?))\n- Conformism can only lead to aggression\n- Even non-aggression can be aggression, if one makes others feel inferior\n- To make another feel inferior is the essence of aggression\n- Vicious circles of lying, hatred and violence—avoid starting new circles, and interrupt those already started\n\nBasic doctrines of taoism:\n- water\n- uncarved block\n- raw silk\n- newborn child\n\n\u003e From the first parental whack to the last deathbed prayer, man is kneaded and pummelled, either by those who want to make him “good” or those who want to use or destroy him. He becomes a reservoir of aggression on which society can draw to produce its goods competitively, fight its wars fiercely, and raise children more aggressive than himself.\n\n- Fewer desires—doesn’t mean desires of the flesh, but money, power, and importance (ego)\n- ==Competition is the seed and the fruit of the greatest social evils==\n- We cannot practice inaction or hold the uncarved block unless we cease to care whether the world yields to us or not; and for that very reason it will yield\n- Once you care about public opinion, you can’t keep your balance or hold the uncarved block\n\n\u003e But until morality is discarded by everyone, there will be the dilemma of conformance. Those who conform are full of resentment against those who do not: those who do not conform are a challenge to those who do. Therefore the Taoist conceals his non-conformance. He does not flaunt the Uncarved Block. He does not make a morality of amorality, for that would be committing the error he set out to avoid.\n\n- The Confucians bear somewhat the same relationship to the Tao Te Ching as the scribes and Pharisees to the New Testament\n- Our inner nature is an extension of the nature of the universe; to follow one is to be in harmony with the other\n- To follow nature means being ready to accept her support and her cruelty as one\n\n- In the west, mystics generally regard the universe as real and God as personal; most eastern traditions regard God as impersonal and the universe as illusory\n- A doctrine held by several schools of Buddhism: the past, present, and future are equally real and coexistent\n- The chapter comparing Lao Tzu to other mystic traditions explains why that’s what draws me — less emotional ecstasy, more practical conundrums\n\n- [[notes/certain ends are best accomplished without the use of conscious means|certain ends are best accomplished without the use of conscious means]]\n\n\u003e Ignorance is a disease. “The Sage’s way of curing disease also consists in making people recognize their diseases as diseases and thus ceasing to be diseased” (71W).\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/tarot-for-change":{"title":"Tarot for Change","content":"I’d prefer a bit less Joseph Campbell and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,[^1] but overall, the best book on tarot I’ve encountered so far. Or, rather than a definitive superlative, it’s the book that most resonates with me so far. It’s how I engage with tarot, not for divination, but therapeutically, creatively, narratively, for introspection and storytelling. I took gobs of notes, and I have a feeling that I’ll thumb through it often in the future. \n\n[^1]: CBT is wonderful and helpful for many people. Others though, including myself, have had bad experiences with it. It’s too easily used to gaslight away from real somatic and sensory issues and reframe things unhelpfully as “all in your head.” *[[books/the autistic survival guide to therapy|The Autistic Survival Guide to Therapy]]* by [[authors/steph jones|Steph Jones]] is a great resource if you struggle with CBT as a modality too.\n---\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e Synchronicity is, in the words of ecologist [[authors/robin wall kimmerer|Robin Wall Kimmerer]], “a reminder of elegant connections.” Exploring relationships between things that cannot be explained by simple cause and effect is a doorway to understanding the relationship between psyche, a more collective consciousness, and matter.\n\n\u003e This is by no means a book that claims to tell definitively “what the cards mean.” To do so would be counter to the overarching message of the Fool’s journey, in my view, which resists any fixed meaning and builds the capacity for reality, which is change.\n\n\u003e The job of rules is to manage; they serve a function of control. In a community, rules control the social climate. In an individual, rules control the internal environment, which includes thoughts, feelings, and sensations. So when you break a rule, expect to be met by a wild chorus of thoughts, feelings, and sensations that the ice house walls were doing a great job of keeping out.\n\n\u003e …but the truth is that secrets tell themselves in all kinds of ways. They’re spoken in the choices we make, how we hold our bodies, what we do with our hands and feet, and the ways we behave toward others and ourselves.\n\u003e \n\u003e Behavior is also a language, and when we start to view it this way, we can see how things swallowed and tamped down have the tenacity of water in their drive to find throughways.\n\n\u003e Khalsa said that the best motivator for behavior change is from the bottom up, meaning that coming into the body and actually feeling the impacts of a particular behavior will give us everything we need to know about whether to keep doing it or not.\n\n\u003e True authority is marked by a degree of behavioral sovereignty—the ability to choose actions with intention and care, even when we feel scared and powerless.\n\n\u003e Even if your spiritual practice is just recognizing in some way, each day, that there are things unfolding that you have no say in, that’s a way of honoring something greater.\n\n\u003e I wish we’d tell more than only the stories where we struggle and then get what we want, as if always getting what we want were the point of life. How silly, how childish, how one-note and unmagical. Yes, willpower can carry you to many places. But make no mistake, stuckness is one of them.\n\n\u003e Just as the World in tarot isn’t a fixed place, but rather a flux state that one comes in and out of through time, the peaceful middle way isn’t a static space or destination. It’s not the type of place where you arrive, stay, and hold residence. There, too, is yet another temptation to impose oppositional thinking: I am either there, or I am not there. Healed or still broken. This is why in many decks the Hermit is pictured walking; a metaphor for the way of a person who is at peace with the flux state of reality. That is, changing and being stuck, expanding and contracting, evolving and devolving, living and dying.\n\n\u003e Tarotist Rachel Pollack has written that at the root of our dualistic thinking is a fear that we don’t know ourselves. We see things as either this or that because we don’t trust ourselves to flexibly navigate the contingencies and the in-betweens and the constant flux that is life and to still be okay.\n\n\u003e In many ways, healing from trauma is learning to hold polarities, to be in life’s gray areas again. It is also the path of the mystic, who wishes to experience the truth and totality of things: the good, the bad, and the ugly at once.\n\n\u003e To be in a state of not knowing creates openings, illuminates new pathways, and is thus ripe with potential, even as what we can’t grasp yet may scare us. When defenses drop, new edges and footholds appear, and when we’re flailing, we’re a lot less picky about what we grab hold of to stay alive.\n\n\u003e Our parents or caregivers had preferences before we were born and those preferences didn’t go away when we arrived in this world. They had visions and fantasies about what it meant to be a parent or to have a child. Those ideas were placed firmly upon us and, not because they were bad people but because they were human, our caregivers chose our names before we were even born. Before we had a chance to show the world what our eyes look like when we’re happy, what it feels like to be in a room with us when we’re scared, or how we can sometimes hear colors. Far more than we were ever invited to be who we truly are, we were told who we should be.\n\u003e \n\u003e Each and every one of us experienced this rejection of who we truly are and came here to be in some form. Because someone was counting on us to be something else, something they needed us to be, a supporting role in their own story. This old rejection wound is like a beast we lug around.\n\n\u003e In the words of the mythic Hermes Trismegistus, absolute reality is “all times and places, all substances and qualities and magnitudes together.” (hey! *[[books/a sorceress comes to call|A Sorceress Comes to Call]]* also just name-dropped Trismegistus)\n\n\u003e Bad boundaries often emerge from a wish that we had fewer limits, were more flexible, durable, unfazed. But when a line’s been crossed, when you can’t bend anymore, when it just doesn’t work for you, when it disturbs your work in this world, none of that matters.\n\n\u003e I like to think about boundaries as limits, since a limit is something every person has while a boundary can feel like something reserved for only whole people, healthy people, people who really have their lives together. Whether you choose to enforce them or not, you absolutely have limits, lines that should not be crossed. Conditions that are too much or not enough, those that will support your growth or betray it.\n\n\u003e I’ve come to see that difficulty setting boundaries is sometimes a symptom of a sense of oneself that is insubstantial, or that needs fortifying. Not knowing personal limits can stem from a lack of genuine curiosity about one’s personal wants, needs, likes, dislikes, values, and morals. In other words, what makes you, you.\n\n\u003e It’s tough to say which comes first, the boundaries or the self, but it’s safe to say that without a solid sense of self, we will find setting boundaries difficult.\n\n\u003e In the West we tend to see emotions as insular experiences that exist within individuals, an isolated phenomenon that is mine, yours, or someone else’s. But I often wonder, especially when working with the cups suit—the suit of water—whether we’ve fundamentally misunderstood this domain of our experience.\n\n\u003e Once, humans understood psyche or the soul not as something that existed within the individual but rather as something the individual existed inside. Old ways took for granted that internal life and external life were linked, but today we seem to have forgotten about that. Our narratives usually sound like this: What have I done, what can I do, what should I do to influence the world around me. We rarely ask and get quiet enough to hear what our environments might be expressing through us.\n\n\u003e We tend to think of contemplation as having to do with thinking, but it is really more a creative process of coming into dialogue with other forces, such as emotions. The prefix con-, meaning “with,” tells us that it’s a collaborative process, and templum, the Latin word for temple, connotes a sacred space where a deity was believed to reside. And so to contemplate is to engage in spiritual dialogue, which, like all dialogues, is going to involve both speaking and listening.\n\n\u003e What if, for example, rather than seeing ourselves as taking a walk through the woods, we see ourselves as being a wave of energy rippling through the consciousness of a family of redwoods? How would this change the way we move through the environments we dwell in? How would it change the way we relate to our experiences? (cf. [[notes/we are wiggles|You’re a wiggle, and the world is wiggling you.]])\n\n\u003e Water is an apt symbol for emotion in part because, like the archetypal trickster, it is slippery in the way that it can penetrate walls and boundaries invisibly, going from over here to over there without ever being seen.\n\n\u003e And though projection gets a bad rap, psychotherapist David Richo writes that these products of the relational imagination “show us that other people are not out there as totally other. They are reflections/projections of our own story. They are part of us. They are not only ‘they’ . . . but also ‘I.’ ” And perhaps that’s why the intensity we feel for and toward people seems to magically shift and fade as we ask about and attend to our own wounds.\n\n\u003e Our rusty listening skills are sometimes evident in the experience of working with the raw imagery of a card itself and not knowing how to understand its language. We engage with tarot cards the way we engage with a lot of other things in this world—as objects to support our agendas and bolster our polemics. Not as entities unto themselves that would offer something if we only knew how to listen. \n\n\u003e Maybe we clip a sprig of rosemary from a bush and offer a quick prayer or blessing to show our gratitude to the plant. Did the bush ask for that? If it had asked for something, would you have heard it? Did it even occur to you to listen? Or do you move through life taking, with your arms across your chest?\n\n\u003e In Jamaica there is a saying: “Who feels it, knows it.” That wisdom is perfect here.\n\n\u003e Benedictine monk David Steindl-Rast has written that “the intellect sifts out what is true; the will reaches out for what is good. But there is a third dimension to reality: beauty. Our whole being resonates with what is beautiful.” When we experience beauty, he wrote, we start to speak about emotions, and the more we are touched on an emotional level, the more we seek to celebrate the experience, and it’s there that we begin to create ritual. He wrote that all rituals have to do with, and celebrate, belonging.\n\n\u003e The reframing of repetitive behaviors as ritual, and of ritual as the behavioral practice of preserving and commemorating experiences of beauty, belonging, or any other desired emotional state, is powerful for many reasons. So many rituals are stigmatized, seen primarily as moral failings, called by words like dysfunctional, maladaptive, unhealthy, not serving you, and so on. But as far as I know, the way behavior works is we don’t do things that don’t serve us in some way.\n\n\u003e Instead of calling ourselves stuck or hopeless or lost, we could call ourselves lovers of beauty and of belonging, lovers of deep emotional resonance just trying to recall some sacred feeling. And then maybe, if necessary, we could begin to explore new ways to recall those same feelings, new rituals for feeling safe and soothed.\n\n\u003e A heart’s desire sprouts from a sense of self that’s sturdy enough to have preferences independent of external factors. In other words, when we know who we are, we can appropriately weigh our internal wants and needs against the wants and needs of the whole.\n\n\u003e The primary task in all healing relationships—such as that between a therapist and client—is to listen deeply. Conversely, traumatic relationships are ones in which people consistently deny, overlook, and avoid each other’s truths.\n\n\u003e Which is to say, to clear a space for them to emerge, unfold, and find full expression. Water has for so long been a symbol of birth and life, and I would argue that emotions, which are also associated with water, simply want what all other life wants: to be born, to have a safe space to express fully, and to die, eventually, as all living things do.\n\n\u003e Here’s a charm that’s helped me internalize that understanding: Trauma expert [[authors/bessel van der kolk|Bessel van der Kolk]] has written that humans can endure more pain when they know it is time limited, which means that intellectually knowing the transient nature of emotions is a tool that helps us with the necessary task of experiencing it. This is how an emotion makes its way out of an individual, out of a family, and ultimately out of a bloodline. And so if you are feeling something big and deep, consider your kingship. Consider that maybe you are the one with the tools and the temperament to contain the thing and see it through, once and for all.\n\n\u003e There is a strong and automatic tendency to respond to stuckness with hostility and aggression. So many times, teachers have asked me, “Why are you forcing?” and it’s taken a lot of practice to remind myself that no one’s keeping time. No one is grading me on my ability to make a particular shape with my body, or to respond differently to a trigger, or to do a new thing that I’m scared of, for that matter.\n\n\u003e I fold in a lot of ideas from the tradition of narrative therapy, a natural fit since tarot card reading is in many ways a storytelling practice. Approaching our challenges through narrative is one way to sort of hack the intellectual mind in order to change the way we relate to our problems, or “blocks,” through reframing and perspective shifting. When we relate differently to something, we tend to behave differently around it. As social worker Mary Van Hook has written, “Stories don’t mirror life, they shape it.”\n\n\u003e When all the care or attention is being funneled toward one person, the caregiver is blocked from being seen or known. And I think that’s often rooted in an unconscious aversion to being seen, a deep-seated fear that intimacy is dangerous, and a sense that the things we need and want will betray us or reveal the ways in which we are too much, not enough, or downright broken.\n\n\u003e After all, it was in deep connection that our oldest injuries were sustained, and so perhaps it is in deep connection that the roots of such wounds might be properly treated.\n\n\u003e But let’s remember that at the heart of the spiritual philosophy of tarot is the idea that nothing is all good or all bad. This, paradoxically, is also true for “black-and-white” thinking. Sometimes, seeing things in a straightforward, yes-or-no, this-or-that way can be beneficial. There are times when our evolution depends on the ability to step back from our energetic, emotional, and behavioral experience and simply observe so that we can discern the next step forward.\n\n\u003e When we give in to the tendency to categorize things as all good or all bad and draw our swords at inappropriate times, splitting complex, nuanced experiences into rigid evaluative dimensions, the mind goes from being a helpful aid to a liability, like carrying a knife for self-defense that gets turned back on you because you didn’t take the proper time to learn to use it. Conversely, when we know how and when to draw the blade—like when we’re getting distracted and need sharp focus or have become entangled in a trap of some kind—that’s what it’s there for, why it stays on our hip, ready. As is the case with all of what tarot teaches us, the ideal is moving flexibly between these modes, as the present moment calls for. The sword isn’t going to be the right tool for every challenge in life, but it will be for some.\n\n\u003e Cunning is described by the poet Robert Bly as—and I’m paraphrasing—the rearranging that is necessary in order to stay in contact with what one knows to be true. Sometimes that’s rearranging a material reality, sometimes an internal one, like a narrative.\n\n\u003e Poet [[authors/david whyte|David Whyte]] wrote that “in the wild, the best response to dangerous circumstances is often not to run but to assume a profoundly attentive identity, to pay attention to what seems to threaten and, in that attention, not to assume the identity of the victim.” Which comes back to what I love so much about Ḥāfez’s take on loneliness, and why I view his poem as medicine. Though it can feel threatening, even terrifying, we have a choice to relate to loneliness as an ingredient that might do wonderful things to us, that can “ferment and season” us like nothing else, if we can let it.\n\n\u003e When we make problems into elevator speeches, we’re choosing a psychic location for ourselves—“I am broken, I am damaged, I have been victimized”—and setting up shop there. If that stance is not one of agency or power, we start to see our lives through that perspective, and the brain’s confirmation bias excludes anything to the contrary.\n\n\u003e All stories, for the most part, are incomplete; anytime you are a storyteller, you are also a magician in that you are drawing attention to one thing in part by diverting it from another. Stories by nature don’t contain the whole narrative; they can’t. In order to smooth out the texture of a story—to make it easier for telling to ourselves or others—we conveniently omit perspectives that might complicate things. One of the jobs of the storytelling mind is to make life comprehensible, which means sorting, labeling, and categorizing. But don’t forget that the Fool’s journey is one of occupying the edges, where nothing is all this or that, all good or bad.\n\n\u003e And while you are never—and I repeat, never—required to frame a traumatic experience as an opportunity, you always, always, always have the option to tell a story that highlights your agency and power.\n\n\u003e Hearth spaces, whether private or public, were something to be protected. The fires in them were required to be maintained at all times, and failure to do so was considered immoral. And so Hestia, as guardian of this flame, was the Greeks’ connection to nourishment—since fire is how people cooked meals—warmth, and light, but also to the other gods, since every offering made went through her. Without the hearth, there was no food, no warmth, no light, and no way of communicating with the Divine.\n\n\u003e We are automatically ascribing worth to something when we put our focus there. To a very real extent, we are worshipping—or giving worth to—anything we put our mind to. When you think of it this way, how does that sit?\n\n\u003e Tuck this into your back pocket before you go: The ideal of the World is plurality. It is neither to adopt a perfect protocol nor to reject the rules altogether, to identify as solely individual or collective, but to activate your capacity for a kind of kaleidoscopic awareness where you’re able to hold many truths at once, to move fluidly and flexibly as each moment calls for.\n\n\u003e A therapist I used to see would always tell me that a romantic partner should feel—for both parties—like a book neither of you wants to put down. That doesn’t mean you don’t live your own lives, just that you’re eager to get back, and definitely not dreading it. Choose a deck like that. One you’re eager to come home to. One that calls out and speaks to you in a voice you can really hear.\n\n\u003e Some people interpret cards differently depending on whether the card is upright or reversed in a spread. I’ve never read reversals, and this is a personal choice. To me, any “reversed” meaning has always felt inherent in the upright; for instance if an artist is feeling blocked creatively and they draw the Empress upright, it’s obvious that the Empress is not saying, “Oh yes, your creative juices are flowing,” but rather she’s asking questions about what needs to happen in order to get a generative energy moving again. (Agreed! This is why I don’t like reading reversals! The meaning is already inherent in it. Very [[books/tao te ching|tao de ching]].)\n\n\u003e Keepers of old secrets—whether storytellers, tarot readers, cowboys, or elders—will tell you that the solutions in a crisis always emerge from the edges, not the center. It’s never the king who saves the day. Or the knight with all the privilege and grooming. It’s the absolute fool who comes riding in on a donkey with the ill-fitting armor, the poor man who fibbed his way into the royal party, the youngest daughter that no one would dare put their ducats on. Once I understood this, I started to see it everywhere. If you practice softening your gaze when you look at things, I think you’ll start seeing it, too.\n\n\u003e At the center, much is certain, a lot is fixed. On the edges, though, you can see territories beyond your own. There’s potential for cross-pollination, the sharing of ideas and resources. It’s out there that you can start to see the center—the stuff you think you know for sure—in a new way. I can think of very few people who don’t come to tarot, at least in the beginning, for a new way to see things.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/ten-myths-about-israel":{"title":"Ten Myths About Israel","content":"","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.043464992Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-adventures-of-amina-al-sirafi":{"title":"The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi","content":"A rollicking pirate adventure AND an extensive bibliography for the historical accuracies!

If you’re sensing a theme, then yes. KJC is as genius at plots as she is with names, and there’s a brilliant echo and contrast with both men, who they’re believed to be vs. who they are vs. who they wish to become, and the shadow their respective fathers cast across it all.

She shows how debility, disability, and capacity together constitute an assemblage that states use to control populations. Puar’s analysis culminates in an interrogation of Israel’s policies toward Palestine, in which she outlines how Israel brings Palestinians into biopolitical being by designating them available for injury. Supplementing its right to kill with what Puar calls the right to maim, the Israeli state relies on liberal frameworks of disability to obscure and enable the mass debilitation of Palestinian bodies. Tracing disability’s interaction with debility and capacity, Puar offers a brilliant rethinking of Foucauldian biopolitics while showing how disability functions at the intersection of imperialism and racialized capital.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.047465006Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-road-to-san-giovanni":{"title":"The Road to San Giovanni","content":"I have missed Calvino.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.047465006Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-ruin-of-gabriel-ashleigh":{"title":"The Ruin of Gabriel Ashleigh","content":"Why yes, I’m re-reading the whole series in order, even the miscellany.

Each sentence is exuberant, profound, precise, often scathingly funny—fragments that kaleidoscope by the end into a brilliant, emotional whole.\n\nI’m gonna steal [So Mayer’s phrase](https://www.lunate.co.uk/features/books-of-the-year-2023), because I don’t know how to sum it up better than “a work of Le Guinian complexity about unbecoming a messiah.” The unreal meets the real, a slippery form of time travel, worlds layered atop each other, the past made and unmade, ordered and disordered, a dozen times over by our rapacious empires and our unchosen ones.\n\n\u003e “They’re our mistakes, I suppose… it’s not surprising they’re so hungry to haunt us—the histories we forgot, the crimes we buried. Devils know I’ve buried mine.”\n\n Given that Chandrasekera wrote this one to, quote, [suit the market](https://vajra.me/2024/01/25/walpolitics/), I’m even more excited to see what he unleashes in *[[books/rakesfall|Rakesfall]]* this summer. And give [his blog](https://vajra.me/blog/) a follow—his essays have rapidly become some of the best in my rss feed.\n \n---\n\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e Fetter isn’t even the only feral child of a messiah in his social network. There’s a support group for unchosen ones, which was recommended to him by the therapist he’s been seeing ever since he learned what a therapist was. He attends those support group meetings religiously, every Haruday at sundown. He hasn’t told Hej about any of that yet, but he doesn’t feel like he’s hiding anything. It’s early days, and he feels like he has time. He luxuriates in that feeling, stretching out in it like a cat in the sun. He supposes this is what happiness feels like. It’s an effort to stay grounded in it.\n\n\u003eCloser to home, the Luriati hinterlands are sick with violence; he learns slowly to read between the headlines, to understand that a riot is a pogrom, and that when a monk of the Path Behind is on TV calling for peace from both sides, that it means that the Path Behind is once again attempting to cull the hinterlands of the pathless, and of the races and castes that they consider low and other: his father’s legacy conjoined with the droppings of imperial Alab. Too, he learns there is plague abroad in the distant southeastern subcontinent of Aggiopa, where all those empire-builders came from, endlessly infecting and re-infecting the world. Fetter isn’t ready to grapple with a world so enlarged, so bloated from pain.\n\n\u003e It is obvious that they fear infection, but infection by disease or ideas or identities?\n\n\u003e In its own way, it is the perfect distillation of everything that is good about Luriat; the freedoms it gives, to those allowed to accept them; the space it creates for its citizens to make, to see, to hear, to be art, if they so desire and as long as that art does not cross the invisible lines of force that would bring down the boots and the drums.\n\n\u003e They were a cult, the first cult we had ever known, and we had no defenses against them. They infected us with strange ideas from the south-west. They brought doctrines of shame and disgust for the body and the glorification of the perfected mind. They asked us to look at our bodies not as the clean and perfect instruments of living that we had known, but as bags of flesh containing the thirty-one parts of impurity: the hairs of the head and the body; the nails and the teeth; the skin, flesh, and tendons; the bones and marrow; the heart, liver, and kidneys; the lungs, pleurae, and spleen; the intestines large and small—the shit and undigested food; the bile, phlegm, and pus; the blood, sweat, and tears; the fat, sebum, and spit; the mucus, the synovial fluid, the piss. They asked us to reflect on this and be repulsed: is the body not disgusting?\n\u003e \n\u003e Like this, they brought endless categorizations and subcategorizations and enumerations of being and experience. They brought, almost incidentally, the politics they knew, of centralization, of the consolidation of power, a politics of thrones.\n\n\u003e No one in this group is entirely present, not even Fetter. Everyone is neck-deep in plot, entangled in things that are too complicated to even talk about.\n\n\u003e They are all unchosen too; it’s just that the degree of their unchoosing is greater because they were never almost-chosen. Perhaps that distinction is finer than he’d thought. It means there’s no such thing as ordinary people.\n\n\u003e Fame, she says, is how a ruling class conditions artists to docility and incorporates their work to lesser ends. Sedition, unrest, and even revolution are useful to political actors currently out of power.\n\n\u003e Fetter himself thinks of the law less as strategic or rule-based and more as a muddled, dangerous beast. A rabid leopard, like Caduv’s character in the play. None of the others understand that the law might do anything, at any time, to anyone, and justify itself any way it likes—it is feral, like the invisible laws and powers of the world of which it is a pale imitation. It’s because none of them can see the devils, he thinks. That’s why they’re all so optimistic about worldly law.\n\n\u003e This is how the thought comes at him; sidelong, clinging to the back of another thought like a tick, or a child.\n\n\u003e He thinks of Hej and he aches. He thinks of Hej’s face, his smile, his hands, the low burr of his voice, the scratching of his beard. He aches, but there is also a low shameful breathing out, release, relief. All those lies of omission, all the secrets he’s kept; he can let go of that guilt from never opening up, never sharing his truth, never loving more than he feared.\n\n\u003e There is a reason the older term for devils is invisible laws and powers, Fetter reminds himself. Mother-of-Glory taught him this, and he’s seen it in his reading, deep in the heart of abstruse footnotes. The devils are not a people or a species. They don’t groom or fuck or fight or die. They may not be alive, or even truly be a them, as he understands the theory, not beings with a consciousness or sense of self that a mortal would recognize. They are principles of the world’s operation. They are gears and wheels; they are interlocking, grinding teeth. Or so it is supposed, at the most sophisticated level of mortal thought that he has ever encountered. There is no telling if this is any more or less true than the childhood terror of monsters that they still evoke in him.\n\n\u003e Even manipulation would speak of a kind of care that’s absent in this room. They don’t care, because the outcome of this room is already decided.\n\n\u003e …the no-time of this no-place. The discrete tick tock of timepass becomes a liquid gurgle, as if he is submerged in the unending flow of a river in which the boundaries between objects dissolve into a slurry that passes into silt through his hands.\n\n\u003e But is there such a thing as a type of devil? Isn’t that more race science? Isn’t it just a simplifying habit of thought, no different from the pervasive Luriati nonsense of higher and lower types? Perhaps, he thinks, peering carefully into the murk, every devil is unique and that they sometimes look like each other only reflects that they are kin. What difference does it make, when the devil is in the water at his feet?\n\n\u003e Fetter finds it within him to roll his eyes. “This isn’t death magic,” he says. “Filling in fucking citizenship forms in post-Occupation Luriat is death magic. This is just … doctoring.”\n\n\u003e “You already have a Saint-General and a Saint-Errant,” Fetter says, at last. “Aren’t they a matched set? Order and disorder—don’t they cover all eventualities between them?”\n\n\u003e Status is a rainbow on a proud soap bubble, inflated to its uttermost.\n\n\u003e Rulers love to submit, and the Path has always paid too much attention to thrones and not enough to people.\n\n\u003e “You make the same mistake again and again,” Ordinary says. “The sin of metonymy. I say people and you hear the people. I say power and you think of thrones and parliaments.”\n\n\u003e What is it that comes out of the Embassy’s bright door? Fetter never describes it clearly when he tells this story later, leaving his hearers to imagine a legendary monster. Monstrousness seems demanded by the mayhem. Some horrific and misshapen creature, twisted and ferocious, with invisible tentacles and claws and mandibles. Rumour will draw on old hinterlander stories to speak of devils, imaginatively extravagant because nobody knows what devils look like. The news will report it as malign foreign influences. Neither will make reference to bright doors at all.\n\n \u003eI hoped to build a systematic engine for the salvation of billions, but at this point, the Path Above is essentially a massive umbrella coalition of imitation poperies, strange cults, and personal development seminars, dispersed across a wide territory.\n \n \u003e I’m taking Fetter’s part. It’s my oldest habit, to confuse him with myself. A shadow’s duty, perhaps, but I am not him, I remind myself as I have reminded myself since we were children. I am the Unfettered. Someday, I will earn that name in truth.\n \n \u003e I could never hide unseen in the brain of the Perfect and Kind, which he prizes and holds up to the light of self-observation, but in his despised and forgotten gonads there is shadow enough.\n \n \u003e “So much for destiny,” Koel says, offering a wry little laugh that invites Fetter to join in. But he doesn’t.\n \u003e \n \u003e “The only way to change the world,” Fetter says, as if disagreeing with the part he doesn’t speak out loud.\n \u003e \n \u003e “You’re not going to give me some individualist shit about personal growth?” Koel says. “Change yourself to change the world? Something you learned while meditating upon the mysteries of your own ass.”","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.047465006Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-salt-grows-heavy":{"title":"The Salt Grows Heavy","content":"Truly grisly horror with a truly touching love story.

Everything that just felt a slight step off pace the first time was solved with a deeper, closer read, and the addition of Luke’s story. The pair of books together land firmly in the top of my KJC rankings, five stars and then some.  \n  \n- - -  \n  \nOriginal review:  \n  \nWavering on the fifth star, and it’s only because I am so spoiled for choice with KJC, and have books (plural!) by her that have touched my soul, and this one didn’t _quite_ reach the upper tier of my rankings. I’ll be re-reading when book 2 comes out, and I’ll reassess then.  \n  \nBut. But! What I loved, what _did_ touch my soul, is the Marsh. The setting, Romney Marsh, is basically a character in its own right, and it’s KJC at her brilliantest with the lush sense of place. Ever since she announced that was going to be the setting, I have been eagerly anticipating it, and every bit of it was what I hoped for and then some. The language, the natural history, the way it shapes the characters, I soaked it up.  \n  \nFor example: Joss finally calling Gareth ‘Marshman’ was the more emotional scene for me, not the exchange of rings at the end. In fact, that may be one of the few things I bounced slightly off of: she hit more of the traditional regency romance beats, as one would for their first major trad-pub book (yay for that!), whereas my all-time faves are when she subverts more of those beats. (Think Kim and Will desperately trying to free themselves from an earldom, etc.)  \n  \nSo yes. Thoughts! I have them! And feelings. Will see which wins out after book 2.

Mike is middle-aged, gay, single, and lost, with no cultural script for how someone like him can find connection and happiness. He believes the best he can hope for is hookup apps and casual flings, until he meets the capricious Matteo and the enigmatic Dave, who each challenge him in different ways.  \n  \nWhat stood out to me is that, just like Mike without a script, this book has no formula. It’s not a romance that would fit in that genre; it’s not quite litfic of a midlife crisis either. It feels like it’s mapping new terrain, page by page, stuck when Mike is stuck, forging new paths as Mike forges them, unpredictable the way real life is. It could have gone any number of ways right up until the end, which makes the outcome all the more poignant. As another review on Goodreads says, it opens up portals of possibility, with a tough conversations along the way. I like that. I like the idea that those portals are there to find. New scripts to be written, new paths to forge, new maps to make. With a bit of guts, with a bit of love, with a bit of honesty and vulnerability. May we all be so brave.\n\n*ARC kindly provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.047465006Z","tags":[]},"/books/the-sugared-game":{"title":"The Sugared Game","content":"Re-read 12/24. \n\nWay back the first time I read it, I praised all the talk—long pages and chapters full of Will and Kim talking. That still stands, but I would also like to add praise for the long pages and chapters full of Will and Phoebe talking, and Will and Maisie talking. For a book so plotty and pulpy to actually center on such lengthy, deep conversations, without sacrificing any forward momentum, is remarkable. All these characters are defined *[[notes/the earth grows people|in relation to each other]],* and I wish more books knew how to do that. \n\nNote: this final showdown was one of my main points of comparison when I got all grumpy at other books (cough, *[[books/a governess’s guide to passion and peril|A Governness’s Guide]]*) for [[notes/on firearms, trust and historical accuracy|bungling the firearms]]. Here, Will checks the safety and *still* it all goes wrong: the borrowed gun is unloaded. He gets shot in the crossfire. Maisie, Phoebe, and Kim save the day in different ways. Most of all: this is what real support looks like in the aftermath of violence. \n\n---\n\nThe reason it takes me a week to read a book that I literally can’t put down is because I read it twice.  \n  \nWhen I read *[[books/slippery creatures|Slippery Creatures]]*, I wanted to say, this is what it looks like when an author levels up. I refrained, but I’m not going to wait til book three to say it: this is what it looks like when an author levels up.  \n  \nThe Will/Kim dynamic isn’t one I’ve seen her write before. Especially with Phoebe and Maisie taking such an integral part; especially given that it gets three books to play out. She takes her time in setting up the layers of trust and conflict, and it builds up as beautifully as anything could. I like books that build. I tend to use “slow burn” derogatorily because too often it’s stalling, and it’s not a good descriptor here either. But there’s a long, slow build over two books now and counting, all with satisfactory payoffs each step of the way, all with the fun, pulpy trappings of the genre, and it feels so deeply gratifying that I go speechless like Will, confounded and impressed.  \n  \nThe plot hustles, the characters twist and develop, and yet what sticks out to me is how much talking there is. Scene after scene after long scene after chapter of Will and Kim talking, a whole book of Will and Kim talking, in a way that feels like what a romance should be. I know an author’s got me completely when the conversation is even better than the sex. And it’s _really_ good sex.  \n  \nOh yeah, and remember how Will was my favorite? Nope, Kim. Kim, Kim. Kim all the way. Although Phoebe nearly steals it, the secret heart of the book, lighting up rooms and sliding down banisters into brawls. Watching her and Maisie is like a book within a book, taking place under the boys’ oblivious noses. (Well, under Will’s oblivious nose.) It’s a treat.  \n  \nThe book ends on more a promise than a cliffhanger, with more good things to come. Just the blurb has me tingling because it’s gonna go where I hoped. (Kim. Kim’s family. Kim’s demons.) I’m not gonna toss off a blithe “can’t wait,” because I can, and it will be so very worth it. Although I swear, if KJ Charles levels up again, it might do me in.  \n  \n(Or, you know, this is just her average but it hits so many of my buttons I can’t tell the difference.

It’s mechanistic, it’s industrialized, it speaks in terms of gains and losses, waste and production. The medical model we have, from menstruation to menopause, is about irregularity, failure, waste product, syndromes, symptoms, malfunctions. Birth is seen as the one productive outcome, and even that isn’t accomplished by the woman—it’s accomplished by the uterus, the egg, the womb, all these disembodied parts. \n\nIt’s very dismembered, this language, and it’s everywhere. Fragmented, isolated, unintegrated, disordered, which has allowed for the long and depressingly misogynistic history of reproductive medicine,[^1] and excused the violences and injustice visited upon the woman herself.\n\n---\n## Raw notes\n\n- Chaos model, instead of mechanical model\n- The heart isn’t the quintessential mechanical body part, a pump, but a self-organizing system\n- Regularity is normal, good, and valued; irregularity is abnormal and negatively valued.

When menstruation is actually the one thing we all share, fertile, infertile, heterosexual, homosexual.

But Toadling tried to be helpful and stammered when she was nervous and had beautiful, worried eyes in a homely face. Her transformation into a toad was shocking, true, but it did not involve any inside-out bits or explosions, and she was such a small, inoffensive toad and such a small, inoffensive human, and she went out of her way to change behind buildings and things where people would not see it and be troubled by it. \n\n\u003e Thorns die from the inside out, like priests\n\n\u003e “Can you kill her?” she asked. “I don’t mean… That’s not a request—that’s a question.

But I’ve killed a few men, and it’s bad. And they have to be coming at me with swords, and it’s not like not like that, exactly. It’s like we’re all screaming and hammering on each other and you just want everyone else to stop screaming and you hope you stop them before they stop you. It’s just noise and mud and not thinking. But it’s still bad. Afterward, you remember too much of it. And that’s men trying to kill me. I don’t think I can kill a little girl who’s asleep.”\n\n\u003e “You think you had to pay for *two hundred years* for a momentary slip of the tongue?”\n\n\u003e The magic sulked. It had been still and quiet for so long. It wanted to rage like a torrent, pour over things, sweep obstacles away. But it was her friend, and so it turned in its course and settled back in its bed, sullen and quiet once more.\n\n\u003e Fayette lay on the bed, bright as mushrooms in the dark.\n\n\u003e He snorted. After a moment, he leaned slightly toward her, so that their shoulders touched, and Toadling leaned back, and they sat together on the steps for a little time, with the magic washing over them like the sea.\n\n\u003e “All right,” said Halim, and turned away. “I do believe you.”\n\u003e Toadling waited for the but.\n\u003e It didn’t come.\n\n\u003e His eyes were grave. “Some things can’t be fixed.”\n\u003e “We couldn’t change her,” said Toadling, feeling as if the words were broken glass in her ruined throat. “The queen loved her and the nurse and I tried for years and love wasn’t enough and trying wasn’t enough and nothing we did changed *anything*!” She let out a croaking sob. Halim gathered her up awkwardly in his arms and she gripped the edges of his surcoat and cried black ink tears onto his shoulder. “It should have mattered. All that love and all that trying should have changed… *something*…”\n\u003e “I know,” he said. “I know.”\n\u003e Toadling shuddered and shivered against him.

One of the best books I’ve read about healing from abuse, dysfunction, and trauma. So much to relate to on every page (and not just because she had the same [Jimmy Eat World song ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV-HPOHu8mY) as a lifeline in the early aughts).\n\nIt’s heartbreaking and eye-opening that her upbringing (Asian, middle-class, immigrant; raised in what she correctly calls the wreckage of America’s brutal proxy wars against communism) is almost a 1:1 overlap with what was going on behind the scenes for almost everyone I knew growing up (white, middle-class, evangelical; basically the inheritors of the “American dream”). \n\nThe punishment, dysfunction, shame, rejection, generational trauma, and often the outright abuse (sexual, physical, mental) that just got silenced and covered up. When kids need literally the exact opposite to survive: love, acceptance, safety, trust, respect. A voice. \n\n\u003e I am a product of a place. I am one of many. All of us are victims of a dysfunctional community that was very good at throttling itself while murmuring, “Smile through your tears. Swallow your pain.”\n\u003e \n\u003e It is within this normalcy, this transformation of a unique misery into the utterly banal, that I finally feel empowered. Maybe I can change my programming after all. Because the more common the disease, the more survivors there must be. A whole damn neighborhood can’t go down together in its entirety, can it? There have to be people who escape the stranglehold.\n\nIt’s so validating when the key things that help her heal are the same things I’ve discovered. Note: she does *not* break it down into 1-2-3 steps for healing; these are my own notes, a list I made when what worked for her has worked for me as well: \n\n- Self-regulation (calming your nervous system, creating an internal sense of safety)\n- Curiosity (instead of judging or shutting down emotions, befriend them and listen to them; learn who you are when no one else is around)\n- Compassion (every trigger has a purpose; learn to ask “what is this? What is this thing in my body right now? What are you trying to teach me?”)\n- Communication (complex trauma is fundamentally relational trauma—people who were supposed to be caring and trustworthy and safe were hurtful instead; practice healthy relationships)\n- Agency (you have power, you have choice, you have a voice)\n- Love (love, love, love, in abundance, for others, for yourself; the opposite of shame, blame, and fear is love)\n\nThere’s no single magic fix; there’s a mix of what works for each person at various points in their lives. But there is healing, and hope, and I love her definition of both:\n\n\u003e So this is healing, then, the opposite of the ambiguous dread: *fullness*. I am full of anger, pain, peace, love, of horrible shards and exquisite beauty, and the lifelong challenge will be to balance all of those things, while keeping them in the circle. Healing is never final. It is never perfection. But along with the losses are the triumphs.\n\n---\n\n### Pull quotes: \n\n\u003e *It’s okay to have some things you never get over.* In the span of half an hour, this man whom I had known for less than a season did what nobody in my life ever had: He took all of my sins and simply forgave them. He didn’t demand relentless improvement. There were no ultimatums. He asserted that I was enough, as is. The gravity of it stunned me into silence. Joey was the opposite of the dread.\n\n\u003e My family tried to erase this history. But my body remembers. My work ethic. My fear of cockroaches. My hatred for the taste of dirt. These are not random attributes, a spin of the wheel. They were gifted to me with purpose, with necessity.\n\u003e \n\u003e I want to have words for what my bones know. I want to use those gifts when they serve me and understand and forgive them when they do not.\n\n\u003e The brain’s fear reflex is very real. But it has an opposite force, too, as ancient and as powerful. Our bodies and brains melt into kindness in the presence of one key ingredient. “This school made me feel like I was somewhere where people actually loved me.”\n\n\u003e But more and more, I am curious enough to ask the magic question: “What do you need?” These four words open doors and break down walls. With the benefit of understanding, we are no longer two separate beings floating through these threads alone. We are giving and receiving. Two reciprocal atoms hugging each other through the turmoil around us. *I hurt you. You hurt me. You’re mine.*\n\n\u003e PTSD is only a mental illness in times of peace.

I saw someone call him the original troll—that too, the radical printmaker in the time when printmaking was a real threat to the established order. Blake harnessed its power, provoking the church and state with his unorthodox satire.  \n  \nMy favorite work of his is probably easy to guess: A Marriage of Heaven and Hell.  \n  \nAt the chaotic end of the 18th century, William Blake, radical, takes aim at Swedenborg, theologian, for his treatise on the afterlife. He scorns Swedenborg’s theology, claiming it full of “all the old falsehoods.” In fact, Blake takes offense at his lack of creativity as much as his stolid ideas: dividing heaven from hell, soul from body, angels from devils, sinners from saints.  \n  \nIn Blake’s cosmology, there’s no division, just one whole. He flips the script, giving “the Devil” a voice that sounds awfully sensible. ‘Heaven’ is the staid authority, certainty, order; ‘Hell,’ therefore, according to Blake, is the necessary energy of humanity. Passion, chaos, creativity, emotion, desire. You can’t call one good and one evil, he contends, without an irrevocable loss. “Without contraries there is no progression.” In his fervent vision, we ARE the divine, soul and body together, good and evil together, culminating in his epiphany: “for every thing that lives is Holy.”  \n  \nAt around 15 pages, this work somehow feels like a magnum opus. What Blake calls his “Proverbs of Hell” are frank and energetic: “The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.” “What is now proved was once only imagin’d.” His art fills the page, clotting the margins with childlike intensity. It’s provocative and irreverent, disconcerting and droll, ingenious and moving.\n  \nTo be fair, C.S. Lewis comes for Blake in turn, undoing his great marriage in *The Great Divorce*. But arguably, Blake has outlasted Swedenborg. Arguably, he’ll outlast Lewis too. Life has a way of overturning the certainties. And thus Blake resonates, at least with me, in a way his rivals don’t. The contradictions are necessary. We could do worse than to listen, embrace the energy and the passion, the chaos and the doubt.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.047465006Z","tags":[]},"/books/wintering":{"title":"Wintering","content":"DNF due to the health scare(s) both May and her husband experience at the beginning of the book.

I will never read a dictionary the same way again. This was even more interesting than I hoped it would be.\n\n\u003e I call it “craft” and not “art” for connotative reasons. “Art” conjures an image of the lexicographer as medium or conduit— a live wire that merely transmits something unkenned, alien. But “craft” implies care, repetitive work, apprenticeship, and practice. It is something within most people’s reach, but few people devote themselves to it long enough and with enough intensity to do it well. That sort of dedication to words comes across as batty, so we speak in metaphor. Defining is the mental equivalent of free throws in basketball: anyone can stand at the free-throw line and sink one occasionally; everyone gets lucky. But the pro is the person who stands at the free-throw line for hours, months, years, perfecting that one motion until it is as fail-safe as humanly possible, until it looks so much like second nature that an uncoordinated clod like me can watch them lob a rare miss at the net during a game and say, “Are you *kidding?* How easy is it to shoot a free throw?”\n\n## Stray notes\n\n* The wonky rules of English! (use the open compound “back seat” in the phrase “take a back seat” but the closed “backseat” when referring to the seats behind the driver, etc etc)\n* Asimov: “My opinions are strong, but not necessarily authoritative. Please realize that.” \n* “Pumpernickel,” traced back to its Germanic origins, means “fart goblin” \n* Worcester’s publishers steadfastly refused to bow to the vulgarity of cheap advertising, while the Merriam brothers went bonkers for it. “Get the best!” ads in 1849 proclaimed and never really stopped. \n* “She looked world-weary, like a circus clown two shows away from retirement, dolefully waiting for the inevitable pie right in the smacker.”\n* They’ll notice errors, but you can’t notice excellence in a dictionary because it consists of a lack of errors.\n\n---\n## Pull quotes\n\n\u003e “The fact is that many of the things that are presented to us as rules are really just the of-the-moment preferences of people who have had the opportunity to get their opinions published and whose opinions end up being reinforced and repeated down the ages as Truth.” p. 48\n\n\u003e The history of English is full of messiness and illogic because the English language is a true democracy, built entirely by the people who use and have used it, and people, generally speaking, are messy and illogical. p. 182\n\n\u003e Etymological fallacy is the worst sort of pedantry: a meaningless personal opinion trying to dress itself up as concern for preserving historical principles. It misses that language changes itself is a historical principle: a language that doesn’t change is a dead language, and as much as etymological fallacists seem to love the purity of Latin, you’ll notice that none of them have abandoned that whore English for it. p. 184\n\n\u003e Like everyone else, lexicographers need to move faster. This is, to be frank, nothing new: we have always felt the heavy thumb of business concerns whenever we define. And while defining gets easier with experience, and the easier it is to do something, the faster you can do it, there is a terminal velocity in lexicography. After a certain point, you simply can’t go any faster; to do so compromises the quality of what you’re doing. p. 259\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.047465006Z","tags":[]},"/books/yellowface":{"title":"Yellowface","content":"After witnessing the accidental death of her frenemy Athena Liu, failed author June Hayward refashions herself as Juniper Song and steals Athena’s posthumous masterpiece to pass it off as her own.

[[notes/us exceptionalism is abusive narcissism|us exceptionalism is abusive narcissism]] on how that “tenderizing” terror works)\n\n## Tragicomic moral dissonance\n- targets are Official Enemies whose actual, alleged, and often invented crimes are dwarfed by the crimes committed by the western governments and their allies\n- dissidents afforded vitriolic treatment that is never experienced by western presidents and prime ministers who devastate *whole countries* \n- judging the mere *words* of outsiders as worse than the *actions* of insiders that result in mass death\n- example: raging at Gaddafi for allegedly *threatening* a massacre, but not a peep for US and UK leaders who killed over a million Iraqis, including 500,000 children\n- propaganda blitzes never make moral sense\n- ethical posturing generated by a structurally violent, greed-driven system for immoral ends\n- pacifies the public so the powerful can do as they please\n\n---\n\nOr, to put it a lil’ bit more bluntly: 💀\n\n\u003e There’s little or no relation between what the mass media direct people to care about and what actually matters.

Far enemies are the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. For example, a near enemy of loving-kindness is sentimentality—similar but different. A far enemy of loving-kindness is ill will—the opposite of loving-kindness. Similarly, a near enemy of compassion is pity and a far enemy is cruelty.”\n\n\u003e The near enemies depict how spirituality can be misunderstood or misused to separate us from life. (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e I define spirituality as the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to each other by something greater than ourselves. I have friends who are atheists who every day practice inextricable connection—they hurt when others hurt and they know that none of us are free until all of us are free. I have friends who talk endlessly about their religion and wear scripture on their T-shirts, yet demonstrate no connection to anyone’s suffering but their own and maybe that of the people in their immediate circle. I make this point because we’re not talking about religion here. We’re talking about the irrepressible human spirit.\n\n\u003e On the surface, the near enemies of emotions or experiences might look and even feel like connection, but ultimately they drive us to be disconnected from ourselves and from each other. Without awareness, near enemies become the practices that fuel separation, rather than practices that reinforce the inextricable connection of all people.\n\n\u003e “The near enemy of love is attachment. Attachment masquerades as love. It says, “I will love this person (because I need something from them).” Or, “I’ll love you if you’ll love me back. I’ll love you, but only if you will be the way I want.” This isn’t the fullness of love. Instead there is attachment—there is clinging and fear. True love allows, honors, and appreciates; attachment grasps, demands, needs, and aims to possess.” (Jack Kornfield)\n\n\u003e Near enemies can feel like manipulation and even gaslighting.

Life is like that sometimes.\n\u003e \n\u003e But here’s a thing to consider: generally, there will be one set of feelings in a situation like this that you’re more comfortable with. For example, for the person who fears intimacy, loneliness isn’t pleasant, but it feels safe to a degree because it’s familiar. If that person chooses the route of loneliness, their growth is limited because they’re not going anywhere they haven’t been. The set of feelings in the other direction might involve contact with old wounds around closeness and self-worth, and seeing how those wounds come up in close relationships. This second route may be a lot more terrifying, understandably. But at least there is space to grow there, room for new learning.

Much of it, for instance, is concerned with how animal cooperation often has nothing to do with survival or reproduction, but is a form of pleasure in itself. “To take flight in flocks merely for pleasure is quite common among all sorts of birds,” he writes. Kropotkin multiplies examples of social play: pairs of vultures wheeling about for their own entertainment, hares so keen to box with other species that they occasionally (and unwisely) approach foxes, flocks of birds performing military-style maneuvers, bands of squirrels coming together for wrestling and similar games.\n\n\u003e To exercise one’s capacities to their fullest extent is to take pleasure in one’s own existence, and with sociable creatures, such pleasures are proportionally magnified when performed in company. From the Russian perspective, this does not need to be explained. It is simply what life is. We don’t have to explain why creatures desire to be alive. Life is an end in itself.

toying with the idea of how you nurture the *conditions* for change, not forcing change itself. (Or insert the desired *x* here: peace, health, happiness, a better world, etc.)\n\nYou don’t stick a seed in hard-packed ground full of thistles and rocks, not provide water or light, and just sit there poking and urging it to grow. \n\nNo, you prepare the soil. Clear it, till it, cultivate it. Work with the seasons, not against them. Apply the right amount of light and water. Soft, loamy compost vs. hard-packed clay makes all the difference in the world. Flourishing can’t happen without it. \n\nIt’s like the concept of samadhi in the Buddhist tradition. You don’t force insight, you cultivate the conditions within yourself for it to appear. And then it’s a gift that you receive. [[notes/it happens when it’s time|It happens when it’s time]]. \n\n\u003e This is very different than just sitting down and being determined — “I’m going to get concentrated.” There is a kind of humbleness or humility where we’re preparing ourselves almost like to receive a gift. We’re preparing ourselves; you know, it’s almost like if samadhi is willing to come. We're kind of shifting something, becoming a vessel in which to receive something that bubbles up from deep inside. —Gil Fronsdal, [Guided Meditation: Entering Samadhi](https://www.youtube.com/live/6M9-APDpDig)\n\nThat doesn’t appeal to the ego, though.

She explains that debility can’t be understood as an identity like disability, which is usually thought of as an event that happens to an individual, after which they just need accommodations, access, and personal empowerment to be included in society. Rather, debility is what happens when a state makes an entire population available for mass injury — a denial of disability rights altogether.[^1]\n\nThis leads to cognitive dissonance and egregious hypocrisy, where a state perpetuating *genocide* can nonetheless claim themselves a champion of disability justice within that framework of disability rights:\n\n\u003e Israel is, in fact, a signatory on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The IDF proudly claims to be the world’s largest employer of [[notes/autism|autistic people]], and in August, an ambassador told the UN that Israel is committed to eliminating ableism. But this disability rights frame, which for a long time, has been led and theorized by white disabled people who live in the US and Europe, doesn’t map onto the experiences of racialized groups who are targeted en masse by the state.[^2]\n\nIt’s back to that same concept of [[private/worthy victims|worthy victims]] and [[notes/who is more deserving|who is deserving]]. The [entire essay from Jesse Meadows](https://sluggish.substack.com/p/what-does-disability-justice-mean) is worth a read. \n\n\u003e When repression is globalized, our solidarity must be, too.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, we’re seeing the same thing happen in the US with COVID and the subsequent debilitating experience of Long COVID. In response to NPR platforming a woman who sees her disabled husband’s new social limitations as an irritation he is personally inflicting on her, rather than an institutional problem being inflicted on all of us, Julia Doubleday calls out the injustice for what it is. [She writes](https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/disabled-peoples-exclusion-from-indoor):\n\n\u003e This article is not merely an upsetting look at an individual’s victim-blaming mindset about her husband’s indefinite exclusion from public spaces. It is a piece of propaganda intended to further the perception that demands for COVID mitigation are unreasonable complaints, rather than critical activism for basic public health infrastructure.\n\nIt’s the same denial of civil rights, blaming the victim instead of urging awareness and action.\n\n\u003e It is a classically neoliberal world view, one that places the onus of the difficult situation on the *individual* over the collective, that blames the sufferer rather than investigating the underlying root causes of the suffering. “My husband can’t dine indoors because every restaurant is currently violating the ADA” is not a piece NPR will ever publish; it is, however, both a more accurate summation of the problem, as well as one that invites action rather than acceptance.[^3]\n\n[^1]: https://sluggish.substack.com/p/what-does-disability-justice-mean\n[^2]: ibid\n[^3]: https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/disabled-peoples-exclusion-from-indoor\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.239465663Z","tags":["activism","language"]},"/notes/deep-time-decenters-the-human":{"title":"Deep time decenters the human","content":"Deep time, coined by [[authors/john mcphee|John McPhee]] in *[[books/annals of the former world|Basin and Range]]*, is a concept of geological time so vast it completely annihilates the scale of human history.\n\n\u003e Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time.

(Whyte and Brown, lol.)\n\n((Note: maybe what I classify as despair would be more what Brown describes as anguish??))\n\nPer Whyte, in *[[books/consolations|Consolations]]*, despair is a necessary and [[seasonal time|seasonal state]] of repair, a temporary healing absence, an internal physiological and psychological winter when our previous forms of participation in the world take a rest; it is a loss of horizon, it is the place we go when we do not want to be found in the same way anymore.\n\n\u003e Despair takes us in when we have no place else to go. It is a haven of self-compassion, an invitation, a last protection.\n\nBrown classifies despair as the permanent state of hopelessness, whereas Whyte calls it, “strangely, the last bastion of hope,” which turns to depression and abstraction when we try to make it stay beyond its appointed season. (So still the emphasis on the necessary and *seasonal* state of *repair*.)\n\n\u003e Despair is kept alive by freezing our sense of time and the rhythms of [[notes/concepts of time|time]]; when we no longer feel imprisoned by time, and when the season is allowed to turn, despair cannot survive.\n\nThis feels like it can encompass more of what I classify as despair, which is usually part anguish, part grief, part shutdown, overwhelmed by something I no longer want to be a part of. (The ongoing US-backed genocide in Palestine; the climate crisis; every war across the globe.) \n\nIn *Atlas*, it’s more personal, and doesn’t really include that *necessary* need for hibernation and repair. What Whyte calls a difficult, beautiful necessity, as human beings caught in a fierce and difficult world where half of our experience is mediated by loss.\n\nAnd how to emerge, when nothing is in one’s control to fix? By giving the despair a profound and courageous attention. \n\n\u003e To see and experience despair fully in our body is to begin to see it as a necessary, seasonal visitation, and the first step in letting it have its own life, neither holding it nor moving it on before its time.\n\nBasically, you could say it is a waveform, not a prison: \n\n\u003e We take the first steps out of despair by taking on its full weight and coming fully to ground in our wish not to be here. We let our bodies and we let our world breathe again. In that place, strangely, despair cannot do anything but change into something else, into some other season, as it was meant to do, from the beginning.\n\nThat makes me think of [[notes/ecclesiastes as a protest manifesto|Ecclesiastes]], *to everything a season*.

In a letter to her sister Cassandra, circa the publication of *[[books/pride and prejudice|Pride and Prejudice]],* [[authors/jane austen|Jane Austen]] said the following about printer’s errors she’d found in the text: \n\n\u003e “There are a few Typical errors—\u0026 a ‘said he’ or a ‘said she’ would sometimes make the Dialogue more immediately clear.” No matter, though, she continues, “I do not write for such dull Elves As have not a great deal of Ingenuity themselves.”\n\nIt’s a quote, or rather paraphrase, from the second-to-last stanza of *Marmion* by Walter Scott, where the reader is encouraged to imagine how the hero and heroine are united and how the stray plot threads will be tied up: \n\n\u003e “I do not rhyme to that dull elf,  \n\u003e Who cannot image to himself,  \n\u003e That all through Flodden’s dismal night,  \n\u003e Wilton was foremost in the fight;  \n\u003e …. \n\u003e Nor sing I to that simple maid,  \n\u003e To whom it must in terms be said,  \n\u003e That King and kinsmen did agree,  \n\u003e To bless fair Clara’s constancy;  \n\u003e Who cannot, unless I relate,  \n\u003e Paint to her mind the bridal’s state.”\n\n[[authors/helena kelly|Helena Kelly]], in *[[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]],* adds:\n\n\u003e This stanza, the stanza that pops into Jane’s head when she’s thinking about how her newly appeared novel will be read, deals with what an author can expect a reader to do. It’s about the author’s desire for readers who can join the dots, follow implications and allusions through to their natural conclusions, who can “image” for themselves, “paint” for themselves, who don’t necessarily have to see the words set down in order to understand the message.\n\nReading between the lines, connecting the dots. Austen already asks that much of her readers with the narrative voice she refined—nay, invented. There’s a constant, clever irony between what is said and what should be understood, a discrepancy that allows the reader to discover for themselves who her characters really are, and how that differs from how they’re seen by others or how they see themselves. In her correspondence with Richard Crosby, the publisher who shelved her first novel for years, she gives herself the name “Mrs. Ashton Dennis” so she can sign the letter with the acrostic “MAD.”\n\nIt’s not a stretch to think she wrote other thoughts in clear view, wanting only for readers with the ingenuity to see it. An ingenuity to match her own, for no dull elf was she.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.239465663Z","tags":["annotation"]},"/notes/ecclesiastes-as-a-protest-manifesto":{"title":"Ecclesiastes as a protest manifesto","content":"No wonder Ecclesiastes has long been my favorite part of Hebrew scripture (along with Song of Songs, Esther, and… nope, just those three I think.)

They energize us for fight-and-flight and live in our limbic system. \n\n**Routine emotions** such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and anger nourish our lives, lasting for a while then fading. Humans, on average 30 or more different emotional states every day. These emotions don’t require thought—they occur as a matter of course, and originate in the sensory part of the brain. (Note: it is likely the routine emotions that are hardest for people with alexithymia to access.)\n\n**Reflective emotions** such as anger, grief, and jealousy occur primarily in our prefrontal cortex and require conscious thought. \n\nReactive emotions are some of the hardest ones to cool off. These are happening in the limbic and survival portions of the brain, and our prefrontal cortex is what houses our executive functioning and observing self. When this part of our brain is online, we’re more easily able to calm ourselves down. But that is the precise part of the brain that tends to go offline during emotionally intense moments. Some studies have shown that ADHDers and Autistic people have reduced connectivity between the more emotional centers of our brains and our prefrontal cortex, and must work harder to bring the prefrontal cortex back online during emotionally hot moments.\n\nWhen we can take two seconds to pause and identify the emotion, we are bringing observing and reflective self to the forefront, which helps to bring our prefrontal cortex back online. This helps calm the whole system down.  When we label our emotions, we recruit our prefrontal cortex to come help down-regulate the limbic system and so-called “reptilian brain.” \n\nThis is likely one reason we see increased rates of anxiety among people with alexithymia. Because they cannot label their emotions, they aren’t as easily able to recruit their prefrontal cortex to help out and self-soothe when their fear system gets activated. So for people who struggle with emotional regulation or alexithymia, emotional labeling can be particularly helpful in developing effective self-soothing and coping strategies.\n\nSource: [Neurodivergent Insights - Emotional Identification](https://neurodivergentinsights.com/blog/emotional-identification)","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.239465663Z","tags":["therapy","autism","emotional-intelligence"]},"/notes/emotions-are-experienced-individually-and-collectively":{"title":"Emotions are experienced individually and collectively","content":"From *[[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]],* [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]]:\n\n\u003e But with emotions, it’s not always clear who “owns” them. I’ve woken up heavy with the boulder of my grandmother’s grief on my chest, breathed deeply while sweating from the fire of my mother’s rage, and I could say, “That’s theirs, not mine,” if I wanted to, but what good would that do? Emotions are living energetic currents with life cycles of their own. They tend to survive down the vertical and horizontal lines of human relationships—through generations, through communities—until they arrive to the place where they can be fully experienced and expressed. That can take a while.\n\n\u003e It seems to me that when an emotion arrives, it’s yours to deal with, regardless of where it came from. If a storm comes and floods your house, would you search for whom the water belonged to and then send the nearest large body of water a bill for the damage? When the house floods, it is inconsequential which body of water or whose territory it was where the rain clouds formed. No one asks, no one cares. If you’re in it, it’s yours to deal with.\n\n\u003e So often our problems in the emotional space stem from beliefs that grief means we did something wrong or that if we’re angry, we ought to be ashamed. We don’t have to look at it this way. Emotions come from all kinds of places; we can be like the cup and make a space to receive them.\n\n\u003e Emotions and imagination transcend what we consider to be personal limitations in that they’re experienced both individually and collectively. A feeling or fantasy can be private, but can also be shared between two people, a group, or a family. People in cultures all over the world in geographic isolation from one another have generated and told stories with motifs and characters that echo or resemble one another since time out of mind. You will experience some emotions and you won’t know where they came from. You won’t be able to intellectually trace back the origins, and I don’t think you necessarily need to.\n\n---\n- previously: [[notes/at every level we are a web of interdependencies|at every level we are a web of interdependencies]]\n- see also: [[notes/individuality is inseparable from community|individuality is inseparable from community]], and the [[notes/the limits of the individual are porous|the limits of the individual are porous]]","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.239465663Z","tags":["emotional-intelligence"]},"/notes/endurance":{"title":"The Chinese word for endurance","content":"In *[[books/what my bones know|What My Bones Know]]*, [[authors/stephanie foo|Stephanie Foo]] says:\n\n\u003e It made perfect sense to me later in life when I discovered that the Chinese word for endurance is simply the word _knife_ on top of the word _heart_.

Queen Elizabeth proclaimed a set of laws designed to maintain order and contribute to the general good of the kingdom: **the English Poor Laws**.  These laws remained in force for more than 250 years with only minor changes. Essentially, the laws distinguished ==three major categories of dependents: the vagrant, the involuntary unemployed, and the helpless==. The laws also set forth ways and means for dealing with each category of dependents. Most important, the laws established the parish (i.e.,local government), acting through an overseer of the poor appointed by local officials, as the administrative unit for executing the law.\n\u003e\n\u003e The poor laws gave the local government the power to raise taxes as needed and use the funds to build and maintain almshouses; to provide indoor relief (i.e., cash or sustenance) for the aged, handicapped and other ==worthy poor==; and the tools and materials required to put the unemployed to work. Parents were required to support their children and grandchildren. ==Likewise, children were responsible for the care of their unemployable parents and grandparents.== Children whose parents could not support them were forced into mandatory apprenticeships. ==They had no right to object== to the compensation or the interference with their own child-rearing activities. Vagrants and ==any able bodied persons who refused to work== could be committed to a house of correction or fined.\n\u003e\n\u003e In response to concerns that dependent persons would move to parishes where financial assistance was more generous, ==in 1662 a severe **Law of Settlement and Removal** was enacted in England==. The law made it possible for local authorities to force individuals and families to leave a town and return to their home parish if they became dependent. In effect, this law allowed a local government to restrict aid only to persons and families known to be “residents.”\n\u003e\n\u003e==The American colonies and state governments== modeled their public assistance for the poor on the **Elizabethan Poor Laws and the Law of Settlement and Removal**.\n\nNote the sorting into categories, the “worthy poor,” the children with no right to object, the laws of increasing severity in order to close the loopholes.

Then, they die.\n\u003e \n\u003e I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a “two sided market,” where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them.\n\nPart of that has to be about consuming vs. creating.

The platforms that have the most traction with young users today—YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch—function like broadcast stations, with one creator posting a video for her millions of followers; what the followers have to say to one another doesn’t matter the way it did on the old Facebook or Twitter.

The emphasis of lawmakers and policymakers shouldn’t be preserving the crepuscular senescence of dying platforms.

Homer wrote historyfic and Virgil wrote Homerfic and Dante wrote Virgilfic (_where he makes himself a character and writes himself hanging out with Homer and Virgil_ and they’re like “_OMG Dante you’re so cool._” He was the original [Gary Stu](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Mary_Sue)). Milton wrote Bible fanfic, and everyone and their mom spent the Middle Ages writing \u003ca href=\"/shelves/arthurian/\" class=\"internal-link\"\u003eKing Arthur fanfic\u003c/a\u003e. In the sixteenth century you and another dude could translate the same Petrarchan sonnet and somehow have it count as two separate poems, and no one gave a fuck. Shakespeare _doesn’t have a single original plot_—although much of it would be more rightly termed RPF—and then John Fletcher and Mary Cowden Clarke and Gloria Naylor and Jane Smiley and Stephen Sondheim wrote Shakespeare fanfic. Guys like Pope and Dryden took old narratives and rewrote them to make fun of people they didn’t like, because the eighteenth century was basically high school. And Spenser! Don’t even get me started on Spenser.\n\u003e \n\u003e Here’s what fanfic authors/fans need to remember when anyone gives them shit: ==_the idea that originality is somehow a good thing, an innately preferable thing, is a completely modern notion._== Until about three hundred years ago, a good writer, by and large, was someone who could take a tried-and-true story and make it even more awesome. (If you want to sound fancy, the technical term is _imitatio_.) People were like, _why would I wanna read something about some dude I’ve never heard of? There’s a new Sir Gawain story out, man!_ (As to when and how that changed, I tend to blame Daniel Defoe, or the Modernists, or reality television, depending on my mood.)\n\u003e \n\u003e I also find fanfic fascinating because it takes all the barriers that keep people from professional authorship—barriers that have weakened over the centuries but are nevertheless still very real—and blows right past them. Producing literature, much less circulating it, was something that was well nigh impossible for the vast majority of people for most of human history. First you had to live in a culture where people thought it was acceptable for you to even want to be literate in the first place. And then you had to find someone who could teach you how to read _and_ write (the two didn’t necessarily go together). And you needed sufficient leisure time to learn. And be able to afford books, or at least be friends with someone rich enough to own books who would lend them to you. Good writers are usually well-read and professional writing is a full-time job, so you needed a lot of books, and a lot of leisure time both for reading and writing. And then you had to be in a high enough social position that someone would take you seriously and want to read your work—to have access to circulation/publication in addition to education and leisure time. \n\u003e \n\u003e A very tiny percentage of the population fit those parameters (in England, which is the only place I can speak of with some authority, that meant from 500–1000 A.D.: monks; 1000–1500: aristocratic men and the very occasional aristocratic woman; 1500–1800: aristocratic men, some middle-class men, a few aristocratic women; 1800–on, some middle-class women as well). \n\u003e \n\u003e What’s amazing is how many people who didn’t fit those parameters kept writing in spite of the constant message they got from society that no one cared about what they had to say, writing letters and diaries and stories and poems that often weren’t discovered until hundreds of years later. Humans have an urge to express themselves, to tell stories, and fanfic lets them. If you’ve got access to a computer and an hour or two to while away of an evening, you can create something that people will see and respond to instantly, with a built-in community of people who care about what you have to say. \n\u003e \n\u003e I do write the occasional fic; I wish I had the time and mental energy to write more. I’ll admit I don’t read a lot of fic these days because most of it is not—and I _know_ how snobbish this sounds—particularly well-written. That doesn’t mean it’s “not good”—there are a lot of reasons people read fic and not all of them have to do with wanting to read finely crafted prose. That’s why fic is awesome—it creates a place for all kinds of storytelling. But for me personally, now that my job entails reading about 1500 pages of undergraduate writing per year, when I have time to read for enjoyment I want it to be by someone who really knows what they’re doing. There’s tons of high-quality fic, of course, but I no longer have the time and patience to go searching for it that I had ten years ago. But whether I’m reading it or not, I love that fanfiction exists. Because without people doing what fanfiction writers do, _literature_ wouldn’t exist. (And then I’d be out of a job and, frankly, I don’t know how to do anything else.)\n\nI sourced the post [here](https://allanamayer.tumblr.com/post/73223957387/i-think-fanfiction-is-literature-and-literature), as the original post, [“As a professor, may I ask you what you think about fanfiction?”](http://onlyalittlelion.tumblr.com/post/29097051054/tywinning-asked-you-2012-08-09-03-37-as-a) is already lost to the ether.

And the American settlers of the time considered Indians and Hispanics to be inferior and therefore deserving of cultivation. The settlers considered the United States to be the best possible way to organize a country so they felt the need ==to remake the world in the image of their own country==.\n\nMany Americans believed that ==God blessed the growth of American nation== and even demanded of them to actively work on it. Since they were sure of ==their cultural and racial superiority==, they felt that their destiny was to spread their rule around and enlighten the nations that were not so lucky. The settlers firmly believed in ==the virtue of American people and the mission to impose their virtuous – mainly Puritan – way of life on everybody else==. This rhetorical background served to explain the acquisition of territories or reasons to go to war, such as the war with Mexico in 1840s.\n\nOutside the United States, the effects of manifest destiny were seen in U.S. intervention in the Spanish-American war when Spain ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico and Guam to the U.S. This was an expansion of U.S. territory as colonies rather than states and was ==another demonstration of growing U.S. imperialism==.\n\nThe term of ‘Manifest Destiny’ first appeared in a newspaper article on the annexation of Texas in edition from July/August of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review in 1845. The author, John L. O’Sullivan used it to describe what majority of Americans at the time believed was ==their mission from God: to expand to west and bring the United States government to unenlightened people==.\n\nSee also: [The Religious Origins of Manifest Destiny](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01gwbag7mpybwtjdb3ffnjhvnd)\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.243465677Z","tags":["historical-precedents"]},"/notes/memes-and-social-movements":{"title":"Memes and social movements","content":"[[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*:\n\n\u003e “Why do games like FarmVille and Pokémon Go periodically sweep social media?

Likewise, pain and distress can occur only at the level of a subjectively experiencing organism (human or animal) in possession of pain receptors and a nervous system able to register emotional trauma, not at the level of an abstract entity without a brain. ==The problem of sexual harm concerns living, breathing creatures, not political parties, nations, or worldviews.==\n\nAnd in an ideal world, we’d be more aware too of [[notes/disgust is a culture-bound syndrome|symbolic disgust]] and [[notes/moral dumbfounding is not moral reasoning|moral dumbfounding is not moral reasoning]].\n\n---\n\nMost succinctly: \n\n\u003e Humans can justify almost anything by calling it natural.\n\u003e Naturalness is the pervasive myth—the one to root out of your head.\n\n([[authors/verlyn klinkenborg|Verlyn Klinkenborg]], *[[books/several short sentences about writing|Several Short Sentences About Writing]]*)","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.243465677Z","tags":["philosophy"]},"/notes/nature-is-emergent-and-adaptive":{"title":"Nature is emergent and adaptive","content":" From the macro to the micro, life is constantly creating options.

When you hit a wall, that’s literally only happening because you’re trying to move energy in a different direction, walk through a new doorway, or dig a new tunnel. And sometimes you have to jiggle the handle a little or learn how to use a different tool because there’s something new in the way. ==Calling something a “block,” “limit,” or “challenge” is a protest in itself, a statement or declaration that you’re not okay with being constrained in this particular way, and you most certainly do not plan to shape a life around some limitation that really doesn’t need to be there.== —[[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]], *[[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]]*\n\nAvoidance and force ain’t gonna work… although that’s a clue too.

Avoidance and forcefulness both seem to have a tendency to make blocks worse, the former by reinforcing a belief that the block is dangerous to make contact with, and the latter by piling on more energy rather than patiently working to clear the existing backlog. Maybe we could remind ourselves that it isn’t dangerous to investigate blocks, but that we can always do so gently, giving ourselves full permission to back off anytime it gets to feel like too much.\n\u003e \n\u003e And I think noticing a block is in itself something to celebrate. You might not think so, those around you might not think so, but I think it is, because it’s when you know you’re ready to do the work. Identifying a block means you get to start poking around to find the malleable parts, the parts with some give, where transformation could happen, little by little. As you go, you’ll learn what qualities of mind are best when working with these things.

(Spoilers abound, beware.)\n\nSet-up: near the end of the book, Jane and Adrian, among others, are confronting Payne, the murderer, who is about to murder another of their party by making him appear to commit suicide (forced at gunpoint to jump out a window). This victim is allowed to hug his wife goodbye, and in a last ditch effort to save his life, Adrian also embraces Jane as a distraction, to pass her a pistol he has in his coat pocket. He does that thing I hate—“shoot when I give the signal” without saying what signal! I swear, if this happened to me, he’d be dead and I’d be standing there going, “but what was the signal!”\n\nBut I digress. That’s not the problem. Adrian does give a signal, Jane interprets it correctly, and shoots the villain. She’s the hero, she saves the day. Payne is not fatally wounded (she shoots him in the chest, but the injury is “not serious,” a Hollywood pet peeve of mine), they get a confession, and everyone lives happily ever after. It’s played as Jane being a badass, and that she can do anything a man can do, and look how much Adrian trusted her, awww, squooshy feelings. \n\nThis is where I have the problem. And I’m going to set aside gender, because I’d have the same problem if these characters were two men or two women. \n\n1. Nowhere in the book has it been established that Jane knows how to use a gun. She’s a young, newly-impoverished daughter of a diplomat and has been working as a governess. Many women of this era were markswomen; many were not. Maybe I’m pining for [[books/proper english|Pat and Fen]] here, but establishing her background with firearms (or lack thereof) during the locked-door house party would be a) great character work, b) groundwork for the later scene, and c) fun and flirty times. But we get none of that. \n\n2. The pistol gets the Hollywood treatment—it’s apparently loaded, primed, and cocked, so all Jane has to do is point and pull the trigger. But this is 1869. In the Victorian era, pistols are notoriously fiddly, even unwieldy. To make matters worse, it’s a pistol Adrian got from a butler moments before this scene; it’s not even his own. He doesn’t load it himself, nor does he check to see if it’s been loaded correctly. Maybe I’m pining for [[books/think of england|Archie Curtis]] here, but the risk of misfires and injury is not insignificant. Or just the flat-out inability to pull the hammer, much less the trigger. \n\n3. Let’s leave aside the magic aim, where Jane hits her target on the first shot despite the weight of the pistol, the recoil, etc. It happens. Either luck or accident, but it happens. It’s hailed immediately as a triumph, end of story, and we cut straight to a bedroom scene and then an epilogue where Jane and Adrian are picnicking and boating, kissing in a pond, living happily ever after. And maybe I’m pining for [[books/something fabulous|Arabella Tarleton]] here (are you sensing a theme?), but just up and shooting a man is no small thing. Earlier, Jane has gone pale and panicked, nearly fainted, over much smaller stressors. Finding the dead body that kicks off the action disturbs her off and on throughout the book. There’s no mental or emotional fallout from nearly killing a man herself, even if he has killed her father? If anything, that would make it more fraught, in my opinion. \n\nSo what looks like this moment of empowerment for Jane backfires, so to speak. Instead of Adrian trusting her with his life, it looks more like Adrian being reckless at best, intentionally endangering her at worst. Nowhere in the staging of the scene is it indicated that this course of action is their only option. Yes, if you’re determined to have a shootout, it’s more obvious to have her provide the distraction while he shoots, especially since it’s established the villain has been fond of her since she was a child. Yes, I understand wanting to subvert those expectations, especially the gender-based ones.[^1] But there has to be some groundwork in place to make that role-switch ring true. \n\nOtherwise, it looks like Adrian selfishly putting her in harm’s way—injury, misfire, the psychological weight of killing a man, possibly even killing Adrian himself or their other friends in the room. The text is frustratingly sloppy: Payne interchangeably aims a rifle, then a pistol. Continuity error? Or he has both? One in each hand? It’s not clear! The scene is not blocked out at all, much less well. They’re in an attic; how tight is the space, where are the others in the line of fire? Adrian lunges to draw Payne’s aim away right before Jane fires. Even the most experienced marksman could fail to hit a moving target under pressure—or hit the wrong one. If the ploy is successful, which it is, it still looks like he doesn’t think, much less care about the effect this would have on her. And instead of developing her character, this sudden temerity comes out of nowhere, negating what we’ve learned of Jane so far. \n\nWhat’s more—Adrian is still calling all the shots, so to speak. It’s his (borrowed) gun, his plan, he tells her what to do and she does it. If flipping the script is the goal, we could have her say no, that’s absurd, \\*insert better plan here.\\* Empowerment and cleverness and a real chance for mutual trust, all at once. \n\nI’ve already summoned [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] and [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]] to the chat, but that’s the level of attention in the writing that would make such a scene pay off. In *[[books/proper english|Proper English]]*, Pat is a sharpshooter and the romance develops as she teaches Fen how to shoot, in anticipation of having her defend herself. In *[[books/think of england|Think of England]]*, Archie, *a career soldier*, loses three fingers due to a misfiring firearm. In [[series/will darling adventures|The Will Darling Adventures]], set post-WWI, firearms are still tricky bastards—clips need to be loaded, or shots are missed, even by experienced spies, soldiers or henchmen. Phoebe and Maisie repeatedly look stronger and wiser for finding better ways to save the day. In *[[books/something fabulous|Something Fabulous]]*, the most absurd froth of tropes and anachronisms there is, *nobody* can pull off a successful dual because *nobody* has proper experience with firearms (save for Peggy), and when Arabella does shoot Valentine—the one shoulder injury that doesn’t peeve me because it’s handled so accurately—the various consequences of that play out for *three books*. \n\nBy contrast, I’m rattled for Jane, and don’t want to see her wellbeing entrusted to Adrian, much less carelessly ride off into the sunset. Who is going to look after her needs? I’m with Payne; he’s an idiot. She deserves better!\n\n*You’re overthinking it, Jamie.* Yes, I know. I understand wanting the romantic Hollywood gloss, but too much of a gloss and it leaves me cold, and the HEA feels remarkably hollow. Sharper writing, more thorough character development, and attention to historical detail could have made that ending a much more satisfying one. \n\n[^1]: Maybe I’m just salty, but if you want to subvert gender-based expectations, start with the part where Jane coddles Adrian’s emotions, putting his comfort above her own. And it’s tough, because there’s a fine line between that and genuine care and support, both wonderful things. The automatic expectation of emotional labor just because she’s the female half of the equation is what rubs me the wrong way, especially when the expectations are one-sided.\n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.243465677Z","tags":["writing-practice","close-reading"]},"/notes/our-best-defense-against-stupidity-is-diversity":{"title":"Our best defense against stupidity is diversity","content":"Appealing as it is want an expert in charge, the last thing we need is a committee of enlightened despots ruling the world.

This is known in the medical literatures as koro, or “genital retraction syndrome,” and versions of it have been recorded, among other places, in China, Thailand, and India.\n\u003e \n\u003e Trying to understand koro, in turn, lead me into a labyrinth of other syndromes, many of which seem unreal to Westerners, though not to those experiencing them. People have “wind attacks” in Cambodia, where the flow of wind through the body reverses or is blocked, causing dizziness, shortness of breath, numbness, and fever. In China some people suffer from “frigophobia,” or the “morbid fear of cold… and the need to wear excessive clothing.” In parts of India you can contract “gilhari syndrome” in which patients arrive at the hospital with swelling on the back of their necks, complaining that a gilhari (a kind of lizard) crawled under their skin and terrified that they will die if the creature reaches their neck.\n\u003e \n\u003e Eventually this path led me back to my own culture, and to our own syndromes that don’t occur in other cultures. Premenstrual syndrome was near the top of this list.\n\nIt’s not quite [[notes/moral panics and mass hysteria|mass hysteria]], but regardless of what’s “real” or not, it’s fascinating how susceptible we are to collective persuasion.

(NOPE.)\n\nBe the change you want to see in the world, etc. etc. Here we go.\n\n## The basics\n\nAll race numbers are grouped by teams. At any given race, the #1 bib (*dossard*, if you’re feeling French) goes to the defending champion, or to the new team leader of the winning team, if the defending champion is not on the startlist. Their teammates receive bibs #2–#8 in ascending alphabetical order. \n\nFor the remaining teams, the first 1-2 digits is the team number, and the last digit is the rider number. The team leader of the next team is #11, with their teammates #12–#18. Then #21, with teammates #22–#28, followed by #31, and so forth.\n\nThe team order is assigned either alphabetically—the Giro d’Italia, among others—or by [World Tour ranking](https://www.procyclingstats.com/rankings/me/uci-teams)—the Vuelta a España, among others. The Tour de France assigns the second and third slots to the previous year’s runners-up, and then the rest of the teams typically follow based on WT rank.\n\n![[images/dossard.jpg]]\n\n## What this means\n\nOnce you know what to look for, there is a logic to the madness, and it makes it fairly easy to tell at a glance who’s who within any given race. \n\nMany races will group their [World Tour and Pro teams](https://www.procyclingstats.com/teams/worldtour) alphabetically, then group the [continental or national (wildcard) teams](https://www.procyclingstats.com/teams/continental) below them. Races sorted by ranking will typically have the continental or national teams near the bottom also, as those teams have smaller budgets, qualify for fewer races, and have fewer riders who can win at the World Tour level.\n\nHigher team numbers don’t *necessarily* indicate a lower ranked team, depending on the classification of the race and the number of teams participating. In the 2024 season, for example, an alphabetical startlist could place UAE or Visma in the 16th or 17th slot, despite being the two highest ranked teams in the World Tour. But as a *general* rule, the higher the number, the lower the team is ranked. The 18th slot onwards are typically the wildcards, i.e. continental and national teams, in first category races.\n\n## What the category?\n\nJust when you thought it couldn’t get more complicated! Each race on the calendar is [classified on a scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_race_classifications) depending on the type of race and the prestige or difficulty of the parcours. This effects which teams participate and the quality of the startlist, which in turn effects what information the bib numbers offer at a glance. \n\nAt a first category race, all [18 World Tour teams](https://www.procyclingstats.com/teams/worldtour) are required to be present, and pro teams need a wildcard invitation to participate (2–4 wildcards per race). A pro-level race will have fewer World Tour teams, so more Pro, continental, and national teams are present. At a second category race, only a few World Tour teams may participate, and the majority of the startlist is continental, national, and development teams.\n\nKnowing the category of the race lets you tell (roughly) how many World Tour teams there are, and thus at which point the team numbers starting indicating lower-level teams.\n\n## Crunching the numbers!\n\nHere’s a real world example, comparing a first category stage race with a second category stage race, the Tour de Suisse vs. the Tour of Austria. \n\n### First category race \n\nThe Tour de Suisse is classified 2.UWT: the 2 indicates it’s race with multiple stages, and UWT = UCI World Tour, which means all WT teams have mandatory participation. Due to its place on the calendar, early June, it’s also used as a prep race for the Tour de France in July. This attracts a high-quality startlist. \n\nLet’s look at [the 2024 edition](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-suisse/2024/startlist). Mattias Skjelmose from Lidl-Trek (formerly Trek-Segafredo) won in 2023, so he and his team get top slot. From there it’s the World Tour teams (WT) in alphabetical order, followed by the Pro teams (PRT) in alphabetical order, followed by the lone Swiss Cycling national team (NAT), which gets an invitation to participate in their home race. \n\nNote that Team Visma and UAE are down there in the 16th and 17th slots, despite, as I said before, being the two highest ranked teams in 2024. That’s their luck of the alphabetical draw in a startlist of this quality, since neither of them won the previous edition. However, any team in the 18th slot and below indicates their lower ranking.\n\nSo in a first category race like Tour de Suisse, glancing at a dossard with #224 tells me it’s a domestique or stage hunter of a continental team, with a very long shot at reaching a podium. By contrast, a race number of #171 (Adam Yates, UAE Team Emirates), #101 (Egan Bernal, Ineos Grenadiers), or #1 (Skjelmose, Lidl-Trek) tells me they’re top contenders for the podium. And indeed, [Yates won two stages and the overall GC](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-suisse/2024), with the others finishing within the top 5.\n\n### Second category race\n\nNow, let’s compare with the [2024 Tour of Austria startlist](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-of-austria/2024/startlist). It’s a second category stage race (2.1), so there is no mandatory participation for WT teams. It’s grouped in the same order as Tour de Suisse, which is handy for comparison purposes—World Tour teams (WT) in alphabetical order, followed by the pro continental teams (PRT) and then continental teams (CT) in alphabetical order. \n\nCrunching these numbers gives us a much different story. The race takes place in July, which puts it in direct competition with the Tour de France, the most prestigious race on the calendar. Only four WT teams and two Pro teams are present, and without their star riders. The bulk of the startlist is all continental or development teams. \n\nDiego Ulissi, the eventual winner, has bib #37—his team, UAE, alphabetically gets the fourth slot out of the four WT teams. (Remember, the 4th team = #3 on the bib, since the first team gets single digits, and effectively no “team number.”) Felix Großschartner is the UAE team leader (#31), by virtue of his being a solid (second-tier) GC rider, but also by virtue of his being Austrian (see [[#Who’s 1?|Who’s #1?]] below). His teammate Ulissi is the better climber though, and comes away with the win on stage 3 and the lead of the race. As expected, the top five finishers are all WT teams, and their race numbers reflect that—Rivera (#5) and Sheffield (#6) from Ineos, the aforementioned Großschartner (#31), and Xandro Meurisse (lucky number #13, [[#Exceptions to the rules|more on that below too]]) from Alpecin-Deceuninck. Two continental teams crack the top 10—Márton Dina (#122) in 9th place, and Ric Zoidl (#81) in 10th—which reflects the (lack of) quality in the startlist.\n\nSo the race numbers still tell us a lot, once adjusted for the race classification. It’s why I can pick up a cycling romance (\\*cough,\\* *[[books/spokes|Spokes]]*) and balk when the star rider is #141 at a 2.1 race. The author is trying to tell me he’s one of the best cyclists in the world—the numbers are telling me he’s racing on a continental team at an unprestigious race.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s another reason why you don’t often see the big names competing in second category races. Continental or development teams are working their way up through the ranks, their riders are often less skilled, the route is less optimal for racing, and the organizers lack the budget to provide full safety measures. Crashes are nearly 100% guaranteed, and the risk of race-ending or season-ending injuries is arguably higher than usual. Or, tragically, *life*-ending: this year’s final stage of the Tour of Austria was not contested after the fatal crash of André Drege (#171) on stage 4.\n\n## Who’s #1?\n\nWho gets designated the #1 slot on a team depends on the type of team and the race. For one-day classics, the best classics specialist will get top billing. At a stage race, GC teams (those competing for the General Classification) will give their best GC rider the leadership role. For sprint teams, their top sprinter gets the spot. For stage-hunting teams—those who can’t compete in GC or bunch sprints—you’ll often see their highest ranked rider as team leader, or their best rider of the same nationality as either the race or the team.\n\nFor example, back when we were looking at [the Tour of Austria startlist](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-of-austria/2024/startlist), six team leaders were Austrian, including Großschartner (#31) on UAE. As I mentioned, Großschartner doesn’t necessarily outrank Ulissi, but Ulissi is Italian, and thus at an Austrian race, they give the homeboy top billing.\n\nAt World Tour races, this pretty effectively sorts the riders, and often (but not always!) you’ll see lots of #1’s winning bunch sprints or on the final podiums, because the domestiques are doing [their domestique things](https://cycling-passion.com/domestique-explained/).[^1]\n\nAt second category races, it’s more of a mixed bag of hopefuls coupled with national affection, so often (but not always!) you’ll see more non-#1’s coming out on top.\n\n## Exceptions to the rules\n\nHave you noticed how many times I’ve said the word “typically”? Because remember, this is an arcane and endearingly random science, and there are *ALWAYS* exceptions. Let’s Q\u0026A!\n\n**Q: What’s up with #13?**\n**A:** Cyclists (who are not [Sean Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Kelly_(cyclist))) are often superstitious buggers, and the UCI, bless their hearts, are adorable enablers. Any other tampering with race numbers brings a swift fine to the rider and/or team, but the lucky (unlucky?) #13’s are allowed to break the rules and pin their number upside down.\n\nOccasionally, they’re even allowed to dodge the number altogether. In [the 2023 TDF](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2023/startlist/startlist), for example, Großschartner was on domestique duty for team leader Tadej Pogačar, which put him at #13. He chose not to wear the number at all and was assigned #14 instead, bumping the rest of the team down until Adam Yates pinned on #19, the “9th” rider for an 8-man team. Which brings me to…\n\n**Q: Why are some riders out of order?**\n\n**A:** At this point, honestly, who the fuck knows. It can be superstition, as mentioned above. Some riders have multiple surnames, and depending on where they’re racing, that country might order alphabetically based on different names. (IIRC, this happens more often in Spain, or to Spanish riders.) And I believe a last minute replacement can just slot in for the rider they’re replacing… I’ve never gotten confirmation this happens, but it’s appears to now and then.\n\n**Q: Why are some teams out of order?**\n\n**A:** If they look out of order, first off, make sure you’re not looking for an alphabetical listing when they’re ordered by rank, or vice versa. Another common thing is that the official registered name is what gets alphabetically sorted, so yes, Team Visma Lease-a-Bike gets ordered by “T” not “V”, or Bora-Hansgrohe gets bumped down the order when Redbull comes on as title sponsor, and it’s now Redbull-Bora-Hansgrohe.\n\nAlso, the Tour de France will occasionally slot their best French team just after the previous year’s podium; in 2023, #31 was awarded to David Gaudu and FDJ after he finished 4th in the 2022 TDF.\n\n**Q: Why is a superstar on a continental team?**\n\n**A:** It can happen, when a rider is working their way up or down the ranks. For example, Mathieu van der Poel, currently the 4th ranked rider in the world, was on the Corendon-Circus continental team and then the Alpecin-Fenix pro team before they got a World Tour license. He started off as a cyclocross star, and Corendon-Circus is predominantly a cyclocross team. Once he began racing on the road, the team got invited to bigger races due to the star power of MVDP. Same once Alpecin-Fenix (now Alpecin-Deceuninck) formed around him. His status elevated the team and scored frequent invites to prestigious races until the team achieved World Tour status.\n\nA more common occurrence is when a superstar is at the end of their career. They can still bank on their fame, but don’t have the results to match, so they wind up on a lower ranked team before retirement. Think Peter Sagan to Direct Energie or Chris Froome to Israel Premier Tech.\n\n**Q: This top-tier sprinter doesn’t have bib #1, is that an insult?**\n\n**A:** Nah. They’re probably lucky (or unlucky) enough to be on GC team with a huge budget, so the GC leader gets the honor. Think Mark Cavendish riding for Team Sky during their dominant Wiggins-Froome years.\n\n**Q: This top-tier GC contender doesn’t have bib #1, is that an insult?**\n\n**A:** Nah. It can mean there’s dual leadership on the team or that the team has multiple contenders (see the footnote below re: the Roglič/Vingegaard/Kuss extravaganza). GC contenders will also fill a super-domestique role for other GC contenders on the team. For example, if a rider targets the Giro as team leader, he may be super-domestique while another teammate targets the Tour (and gets to be first in line if crashes or illness befall the chosen one). The high-budget superteams attract the top-tier talent, so they’re often stacked deep, with negotiations and politics going on throughout the year to keep the peace. \n\n**Q: Do the race numbers affect the order of the time trials?**\n\n**A:** In absolutely no conceivable way, other than a general trend of indicating the higher ranked teams. \\*Side-eyes [[authors/pd singer|PD Singer]] again\\* \n\nIn a prologue time trial, each team receives *x* number of time slots spaced throughout the day. (Riders from the same team cannot depart back-to-back, as this could allow drafting and shenanigans; also, there are not enough team cars to go around.) Barring bad weather, the best riders (i.e. GC riders or time trial specialists) usually get the final slots. That means lower numbers (better ranked teams and team leaders) are often weighted to the end, and higher numbers (worse ranked teams and domestiques) toward the beginning. It doesn’t makes sense (\\*cough,\\* *[[books/spokes|Spokes]]*) to say an Olympic time trial champion is #199. (flails and facepalms)\n\nOnce a stage race is underway, a mid-race time trial will have the riders depart in reverse order of the general classification, giving the rider(s) in the lead the advantage of racing last. So again, lots of #1’s toward the end, but only because the top-level riders have clustered around the top of the classification by this point.\n\n**Q: My brain hurts. Is there going to be a pop quiz?**\n\n**A:** I would never! Go take a Motrin and lie down in a dark room.\n\n**Q: I’m writing a cycling novel, can I hire you to consult?**\n\n**A:** Absolutely! Call me, babes. 😘\n\n\n[^1]: Hey! A recent and notable exception to this: Sepp Kuss winning the [2023 Vuelta](https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/vuelta-a-espana/2023). Kuss pinned on bib #24 as super-domestique for (then) Team Jumbo-Visma. Primož Roglič (#21) was ostensibly their team leader, with Jonas Vingegaard (#28) there to see what he could do, fresh off his Tour de France win. The team “let the road decide” who would come out on top, but before Roglič or Vingegaard could land a blow, a lucky breakaway on stage 6 put Kuss in the leader’s jersey. It’s considered bad form for teammates to attack each other (although Roglič and Vingegaard *really, really, really* wanted to), and so the team happily (according to some sources) or begrudgingly (according to others) rallied around their domestique for the win. This ended in the historic and unlikely result of a single team sweeping the podium, with neither the team leader nor GC favorite on the top step.","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.243465677Z","tags":["cycling","nerdery"]},"/notes/purity-and-supremacy-go-hand-in-hand":{"title":"Purity and supremacy go hand-in-hand","content":"This has been one of my private working theories for years, and the more I see confirms it.

Reading for world-building requires retaining information without context: a term, a place, a coin, a category comes up once and we know what that is—a puzzle piece—that our task is to gather up these pieces as the author drops them, and to slowly assemble the whole. This is not easy. Human memory needs hooks for facts: a mnemonic, a story, context, something; grueling textbook rote-learning fades quickly, but a story of the statesman or the king, that’s what makes knowledge stay.\n\nInterestingly, she notes this is a skill kids seem to have naturally: \n\n\u003e To retain puzzle pieces that don’t connect, dropped without context, is a skill that not all have. All had it once: it is how children read, every book, poster, and headline a stream of unknown terms, far too many to ask about them all, but the child retains them, trusting that they will connect to something someday. Kids [[notes/rhizomatic thinking is non-hierarchal and relational|collect Earth’s puzzle pieces]] every time they read, but as we move to grown-up books they all use the same picture, and define immediately those terms they fear a reader may not know. Thus the skill of keeping puzzle pieces fades, unless we read books set in other worlds, new puzzle pictures which make us retain the skill, as frogs sometimes retain their tadpole tails into adulthood. This—many have observed—is why most F\u0026SF readers come to the genre young, it’s hard to start in adulthood when one’s puzzle-memory skill has sat atrophied.\n\nShe goes on to say that [[authors/gene wolfe|Gene Wolfe]] asks even more, and that like learning to swim before one swims for fun, in many ways one reads the [[series/the book of the new sun|Book of the New Sun]] only on the second pass.\n\nNo wonder my childlike puzzle-loving brain loves this kind of deep worldbuilding. Think [[series/terra ignota|Terra Ignota]], [[series/the locked tomb|The Locked Tomb]], *[[books/china mountain zhang|China Mountain Zhang]]*, or even books like *[[books/among others|Among Others]]* with their own internal logic and language.

The behaviorist theory is the theory that underlies most coercive punishment in the world, from parents spanking their children to nations jailing their citizens.\n\nThis understanding of punishment is that whenever a subject—and it’s always very objectifying, a “subject,” like an animal or a machine, not a complex human being—whenever a subject exhibits an unwanted behavior, you administer an aversive stimulus. Over time the subject will exhibit the behavior less and less, until it ceases. Easy as that.\n\nThe thing to understand about behaviorist theory is that it’s mostly based on experiments with subjects that have little or no power to leave, to avoid the punishment, or to fight back. Pigeons in cages are good subjects for straight-up behaviorism. Human beings, not so much.\n\nEven with pigeons, the effectiveness of punishment only lasts as long as the experiment lasts. To be effective, punishment has to be administered immediately, severely, and consistently, to a level that’s hard to replicate outside of a lab. Once the punishment is stopped, the behavior tends to come back.\n\nOn the same principle, money as a reward may actually buy off one’s intrinsic motivation for an activity. Under some circumstances the reasons people do things can’t all be added up together. Sometimes, they’ll cancel each other out. \n\nPunishing children produces children who behave the way their punishers want them to only when they are being watched. Punitive prison systems actually increase their inmates’ likelihood of committing further crimes once released.\n\nShame, retribution, and punishment will never produce long-lasting, healthy, positive change.  The behaviorist theory of punishment does not work. \n\n(This was before I was logging exact quotes and citations! 🤦🏻‍♀️ But *[[books/humankind|Humankind: A Hopeful History]]* and *[[books/the dominance playbook|The Dominance Playbook]]* were both valuable sources.)","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.243465677Z","tags":["belief-systems"]},"/notes/rhizomatic-thinking-is-non-hierarchal-and-relational":{"title":"Rhizomatic thinking is non-hierarchal and relational","content":"[The rhizome was adopted as a philosophical concept](https://literariness.org/2017/04/26/the-philosophical-concept-of-rhizome/) to describe a process of existence and growth with no clear hierarchy or single central point of origin.

Transcendent function has to do with understanding and finding value in what can emerge when conflicting parts within us meet and clash.

Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein. And we didn’t even work hard at it — much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else’s field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\u003e\n\u003eFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn’t have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. ==It wasn’t the meat that made the difference. It was the story.==\n\u003e \n\u003e It is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\u003e \n\u003eThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn’t their story. It’s his.\n\u003e \n\u003e When she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, [[authors/virginia woolf|Virginia Woolf]] wrote a heading in her notebook, “Glossary”; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. ==One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as “botulism.” And _hero_, in Woolf’s dictionary, is “bottle.” The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.==\n\u003e \n\u003e Not just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you haven’t got something to put it in, food will escape you — even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it’s cold and raining and wouldn’t it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn’t it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e *The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.*\n\u003e \n\u003e So says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women’s Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don’t know. I don’t even care. I’m not telling that story. ==We’ve heard it, we’ve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.==\n\u003e \n\u003e And yet old. Before — once you think about it, surely long before — the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger — for what’s the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can’t eat home in — with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\u003e \n\u003e This theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. ==(“What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman’s lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,” Lillian Smith observed.)== The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that’s what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\u003e \n\u003e That’s right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\u003e \n\u003e Go on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\u003e\n\u003e If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it’s useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again — if to do that is human, if that’s what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.\n\u003e \n\u003e Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don’t, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It’s just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story.\n\u003e\n\u003e It sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think we’d better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one’s finished. Maybe. The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\u003e \n\u003e It’s unfamiliar, it doesn’t come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, “untold” was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\u003e \n\u003e ==The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story.== Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it.[^1] So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn’t any good if he isn’t in it.\n\u003e\n\u003e I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. ==A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.==\n\u003e \n\u003e One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but ==the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd.== (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, “A story should be seen as a battle,” and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\u003e\n\u003e Finally, it’s clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. ==You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.==\n\u003e\n\u003e That is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\u003e\n\u003e So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse’s skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don’t understand. ==I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn’t say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?==\n\u003e \n\u003e If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. “Technology,” or “modern science” (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the “hard” sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\u003e \n\u003e If, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time’s-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\u003e \n\u003e Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else ==in this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story.== In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool’s joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn’t over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\nSource: https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf\n\n[^1]: This makes me think of that bluntly brilliant line in *[[books/always coming home|Always Coming Home]]*: “He thought his hero-soul was in his balls.”","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.243465677Z","tags":["storytelling","creative-practice"]},"/notes/the-concept-of-lila-and-cosmic-playfulness":{"title":"The concept of lila and cosmic playfulness","content":"In Hinduism, the concept of lila is that all of life—indeed, the cosmos—is an expression of divine, cosmic playfulness.\n\n\u003e Lila (or leela) can be loosely translated as “divine play”.

Do they listen?\n* Do they express their emotions in a healthy way? Do they allow you to express yours in a healthy way?\n* Do they take responsibility for themselves? Do they place blame on you when something goes wrong?\n* Do you feel any fear, tension, or a heavy, dreadful feeling that you wish you could avoid?\n* Do you feel fulfilled and happy around them?\n* Do they have your best interests at heart, or do they repeatedly put their own interests above yours?\n* Do they encourage you to get other perspectives and seek other sources of support? To read books, make friends, participate in the community, etc? Or do they try to cut you off and make you dependent only on them?\n* Are you confident it would be safe for you to change your boundaries in the relationship, or to end it if you wanted? Would they take it well and respect your decision?\n* Does it *feel good*? Every relationship has its challenges and stresses, and can mean not getting your way about a lot of things. But it should always be something you *want* to be doing. Not just something that you endure for the sake of love or approval, or that you accept because you are afraid of the consequences, or because it’s what you’ve been told you should do.\n\nIf you are at all uncomfortable with your own answers to these questions, then something about your relationship is off and needs to change.

It’s repetitive information force-fed to you that builds up over time, undermining your faith in your own logic, reason, and judgement. It’s super hard to detect because it’s encoded on the subconscious “hard disk,” which isn’t overridden by the conscious “floppy disk.”\n## Stage one: gain trust and undermine it\n\nThe manipulator builds your trust in their unimpeachable integrity and motivations — usually through bullshit, self-promotion, and ingratiating propaganda. Once they have this trust, they start subtly undermining it until you doubt your own judgement, unsure which way is up. Eventually you’re relying on them completely to clear up your uncertainty and restore your sense of reality — which is in fact their distorted reality. \n\n## Stage two: defense and isolation\n\nThey isolate you, not only from your own sense of identity, but from the input and validation of others. You’re made to feel your opinion is useless, weird, wrong. You stop expressing yourself out of fear of ridicule, judgement, or punishment, because surely they know best.\n\nIt’s like a trauma bond or Stockholm syndrome, reducing you to complete reliance on them, regressing you to an infantile state where you need the all-knowing “parent” to tell you what to do and how to think. \n\n## Stage three: depression and powerlessness\n\nYou live in a state of extreme confusion and fear. You’re stripped of dignity and self-reliance, and exist in an information vacuum where you only see and hear what the manipulator deems relevant. PTSD symptoms often occur — constant dread, hyper vigilance, mind paralysis, nightmares, rage, and even violence. The process is complete and you’re reduced to a willing, passive accomplice in this very distorted reality.\n\n**source:** Vanessa Beeley, [Gaslighting: State Mind Control and Abusive Narcissism](https://21stcenturywire.com/2016/05/26/gaslighting-state-mind-control-and-abusive-narcissism/)\n\n---\n- previously: [[notes/us exceptionalism is abusive narcissism|US exceptionalism is abusive narcissism]]\n- see also: [[notes/how to detect manipulation|how to detect manipulation]], and [[notes/getting clear on your core values prevents manipulation|getting clear on your core values prevents manipulation]]\n- related: [[notes/confusion is a crucible|confusion is a crucible]] — don’t discount that sense that [[books/something’s not right|something’s not right]]","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.24746569Z","tags":["abuse","list","propaganda"]},"/notes/the-trust-checklist":{"title":"The trust checklist","content":"Trust is more of a cognitive assessment than an emotion.

This leads to a totalitarian theology, ironically professing to love all while only operating in service of [[notes/who is more deserving|those who are worthy]]. But lest we lay all the blame on the Protestants, Christianity long before then had become rooted in exploitation and violence: \n\n\u003e Hence, it was Christian for the Saxons to submit to “Holy Roman” imperial violence, to be crucified like Christ. The Carolingians constructed a Christian piety that used violence to convert pagans and then taught its victims to regard their violation as justified and sanctified.[^1]\n\nThis is the very same concept was perpetuated via [[notes/manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]. Once the colonies were settled, it became America’s founding myth. They had already inherited this legacy of violence, us vs. them, and either had to renounce their beliefs (so difficult!) or see themselves as superior and entitled to conquer this land. \n\n\u003e Puritan religious piety could not teach the equilibrium and equanimity needed to heal from horror, to relinquish fear, to forgive their enemies or themselves, and to repair harm. They lacked the spiritual disciplines that taught them to observe the world carefully, to trust the senses, and to wonder at the beauty of the land.[^2]\n\nThus the groundwork was laid, and all around us we see a blind, unquestioned belief in those principles. “Just because a myth is old doesn’t mean it’s healthy.”[^3] [[notes/healthy stories are fluid not fixed|What can our new myths be?]]\n\n[^1]: Rebecca Ann Parker and Rita Nakashima Brock, *Saving Paradise*\n[^2]: *ibid*\n[^3]: Sophie Strand, *The Flowering Wand*","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.24746569Z","tags":["belief-systems"]},"/notes/think-in-ecosystems-not-systems":{"title":"Think in ecosystems, not systems","content":"When we want to change the system, we’re still thinking in terms of *systems.* That only leads to more authoritarianism, even if the despots briefly agree with us.

We must analyze their actions remembering that the need to conserve resources and seem stronger than they are shapes everything they do. \n- Censorship aims to be visible, talked about, seen, feared. This increases its power. \n- Censors’ projection of fear and power is a form of deliberate psychological manipulation which can outsource censorship far beyond the censor’s sphere of control, even to citizens of other nations.

Now the public can leave their doubts and fears in trustworthy hands and assuage their deep sense of guilt, not realizing that NGOs are the integral part of the apparatus, operating on the leash of neo-colonialist financing and influence\n\n\u003e In this state of oppressed consciousness the victim accepts what they are told. They accept that the US can sell cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia that obliterate human beings and lay waste to essential civilian infrastructure in Yemen. They accept that the US financially, ideologically \u0026 militarily supports the illegal state of Israel and provides the arsenal of experimental weapons that maim and mutilate children and civilians on a scale that is unimaginable. They accept that a crippling blockade of the already impoverished and starving nation of Yemen is “necessary” to resolve the issues of sectarian divisions that only exist in the minds of their Congressional abusers.\n\u003e \n\u003e The majority of Americans accept mass murder under the pretext of the _right to protect_, because their ability to form rational and reasoned opinions has been engineered out of them. This is now the definition of US exceptionalism. It is their ability to manipulate the world into accepting their lawlessness and global hegemony agenda. In seeking to impose its own image upon our world the US has drifted so far from its founding principles, one wonders how they will ever return to them. They have employed a recognised form of torture to ensure capitulation to their mission of world domination which entails the mental, physical and spiritual torture of target civilian populations. —[ibid.](https://21stcenturywire.com/2016/05/26/gaslighting-state-mind-control-and-abusive-narcissism/)\n\nThe US has indeed achieved exceptionalism—an exceptional level of global and domestic abuse. But breaking the cycle of that abuse is just like breaking any other cycle: bring as much awareness to it as possible. Get clear on what’s happening, take back your will, and refuse to be complicit.

Totally fits because as much as I love her as an author (*[[books/lent|Lent]]*! *[[books/among others|Among Others]]*!), I always say Jo is my favorite reader. \n\nI was trying to find out if [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]] coined vocateur in the [[series/terra ignota|Terra Ignota]] series, and the results of just a cursory google search all give her credit for the term. The only early citation I could find is [a JSTOR article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26281186) from 1983 which, from the preview, seems to be discussing Arno Schmidt’s *Leviathan*. So maybe an obscure term (possibly in translation?) that Ada popularized, at least? \n\nAnyway. Vocateur (“voker” for short) is basically someone intensely devoted to their chosen vocation. I like the connotation with [[notes/an amateur is one who loves|amateur]] too, which in French, means “lover.” A “*lover of*,” instead of “*expert at*.” You could say a *vocateur* cultivates that *amateur* love into expertise.\n\nIn the post-scarcity world of Terra Ignota, careers are a thing of the past, no one needs to earn their basic necessities, and one is not permitted to work more than a certain number of hours per week (10 I think?). Vocateurs apply for the permission to work extended hours on their passions. \n\nFrom [an interview with Ada](https://mrissa.livejournal.com/966088.html?): \n\n\u003e I’ve been delighted to have a lot of readers respond enthusiastically to voker/vocateur, and I do think it’s something we see every day but don’t have a good name for, the difference between someone who works and then stops versus someone for whom work is an all-hours passion.  We have “day job” but that implies that it’s somehow not important, not the real you, whereas I have friends who love their jobs and are great at them but are still happy that the job ends when they clock out.  I like how voker/vocateur make clear that both kinds of relationship to one’s work are good and worthy of respect.\n\nAppealing to that passion/love/respect makes the word useful to discuss the opposite too:\n\n\u003e I think the word “vocateur” is an important one to have as a tool for discussing job exploitation, how so many jobs that people are willing to do for love become riddled with exploitative practices (teaching, research, writing, animation, social work...) —Ada Palmer, Twitter, 12/25/19: https://twitter.com/Ada_Palmer/status/1209982918321414150\n\n---\n- see also: [[notes/what's the point if we can't have fun|what’s the point if we can’t have fun?]]","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.24746569Z","tags":["lexicon","economics"]},"/notes/vorfreude":{"title":"Vorfreude","content":"The German word vorfruede has no English equivalent.

(None ever succeeded.)\n\n\u003e Zhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on a bridge over the River Hao, when the former observed, “See how the minnows dart between the rocks! Such is the happiness of fishes.”\n\u003e “You not being a fish,” said Huizi, “how can you possibly know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “And you not being I,” said Zhuangzi, “how can you know that I don’t know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “If I, not being you, cannot know what you know,” replied Huizi, “does it not follow from that very fact that you, not being a fish, cannot know what makes fish happy?”\n\u003e “Let us go back,” said Zhuangzi, “to your original question. You asked me how I knew what makes fish happy. The very fact you asked shows that you knew I knew—as I did know, from my own feelings on this bridge.”\n\nThe anecdote is usually taken as a confrontation between two irreconcilable approaches to the world: the logician versus the mystic. But if that’s true, then why did Zhuangzi, who wrote it down, show himself to be defeated by his logician friend?\n\n\u003e After thinking about the story for years, it struck me that this was the entire point. By all accounts, Zhuangzi and Huizi were the best of friends. They liked to spend hours arguing like this. Surely, that was what Zhuangzi was really getting at. We can each understand what the other is feeling because, arguing about the fish, ==we are doing exactly what the fish are doing: having fun, doing something we do well for the sheer pleasure of doing it. Engaging in a form of play.== The very fact that you felt compelled to try to beat me in an argument, and were so happy to be able to do so, shows that the premise you were arguing must be false.

The highs were high (*Gathered Heat!* Adib Khorram’s romcom! Kingfisher and Borges!) but the lows were low with a streak of disappointing historical romances. I’m almost ready for a solid three-star mediocre read to decompress. A lucky number 13 once again, but that’s with stranding four (excellent) books that I’m within a couple chapters of finishing—stay tuned for September.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/evil eye|Evil Eye]]* — [[authors/etaf rum|Etaf Rum]] (2023)\n\nThis is why I wanted to read more Etaf Rum. This is the book I knew she had in her. It’s just as brilliant and damning a portrait of a toxic marriage as *[[books/liars|Liars]]* was, with the added generational trauma and displacement of a Palestinian family. Those are the parts that brought tears to my eyes, the glimpses of the nakba and the camps, the unspeakable loss, the traditions and meals Yara preserves even in the mountains of North Carolina. It does one another beautiful thing that *Liars* doesn’t do, too—it’s not so insular, it’s ultimately friendship and connection that break the spell of isolation and grief and help Yara find her way out. It’s a love story in the end, between a mother and her daughters, between two best friends, between a woman and herself. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/lessons from cruising|Lessons from Cruising]]* — [[authors/martin goodman|Martin Goodman]] (2024)\n\nJoke’s on me, because I picked up this ARC for the last story, a retelling of *Billy Budd* from Captain Vere’s point of view. I figured I’d sample the rest; instead I went down the buffet line and inhaled them all. Rarely do I like *every* story in a short story collection, but that’s what Goodman’s done to me. The cover and title are not helping the book find its audience, as indicated by the low ratings and confused reviews on Goodreads. I expected stoic litfic *a la* Garth Greenwell; instead there’s surrealism, hilarity, dream states, spec fic and fantasy, myth retellings, and my favorite: the disillusioned Anglican vicar Alan, writing letters from Tarsus and Antioch, heretically following the footsteps of St. Thekla and St. Paul. The writing buzzes with life, surreal, queer in every sense of the word, delightful. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a sorceress comes to call|A Sorceress Comes to Call]]* — [[authors/t kingfisher|T. Kingfisher]] (2024)\n\nI’m here all day long for T. Kingfisher’s aging, aching protagonists, with bad knees and big hearts and a well-honed sense of doom. The plot is a very loose retelling of The Goose Girl, minus princesses and kings and plus a conniving, murderous, sorceress mother. Evangeline, aka Doom, is determined to marry herself and her trapped, obedient daughter to the highest bidders in proper Regency-esque fashion, plans thwarted when she encounters a squire’s spinster sister who sees her for exactly who she is. There’s a coterie of women to the rescue: the no-nonsense Hester, the ruthless Imogene, the enchanting Penelope, and eventually Doom’s daughter Cordelia herself. \n\nIt’s not rah-rah feminism so much as it is changing the terms for who we deem worthy of consideration, agency, and power in these stories. In T. Kingfisher fashion, that includes the animal world as well. I’d happily read a whole series of Hester, her geese, and her friends (including Richard) living their best life and thwarting monsters in whatever form they take. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/hot earl summer|Hot Earl Summer]]* — [[authors/erica ridley|Erica Ridley]] (2024)\n\nA goofy, over-the-top farce with the volume dialed up to 11. Which seems *absurd* to complain about, given how I just read and loved *[[books/something extraordinary|Something Extraordinary]]*—surely if anything is dialed up to 11 it’s the Tarletons. But Alexis Hall grounds his farce with deep emotion and intimacy, using it to scratch away at the actual farce of a society that dictates such rigid, preposterous roles. I feel Erica Ridley wanting to do something similar, but it stays at the superficial level, with ripped abs and lust at first sight and a relationship that’s just as conventional as you please, apart from a heroine with a sword. I applaud the found family and the chronic disability rep, but without deeper character work, this veers into cartoonish and (she winces) boring territory for me. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/the palace of eros|The Palace of Eros]]* — [[authors/caro de robertis|Caro De Robertis]] (2024)\n\nMy adjectives for the prose: purple, dense, florid, bloated. It sounds like I’m describing a corpse. DNF @ 15% because none of it is connecting with me, not the first-person Psyche nor the third-person Eros, nor the prose that’s turgid to the point of hyperbole. (Did I just want the chance to deploy the word turgid? Maaaaaybe. It’s such a good word.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the emperor and the endless palace|The Emperor and the Endless Palace]]* — [[authors/justinian huang|Justinian Huang]] (2024)\n\nI kept my expectations low, and the writing shows promise on the sentence level—but on the plot/structure/worldbuilding/thematic level, it falls apart. There are plot twists that change the entire point of the story, but Huang doesn’t write like he knows that. (If there’s a second book, perhaps he plans to explore that further, but it doesn’t come together in this book.) Bummer, because a queer AF update of two queer AF ancient Chinese stories—one of which gives us the origin of the term cut-sleeve—is such a great concept, and one I really want to read.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/ficciones|Ficciones]]* — [[authors/jorge luis borges|Jorge Luis Borges]] (1994)\n\nBorges is up to some delightful fuckery, playing with form, inventing books and authors and universes that are just as, to paraphrase, contaminated with fiction as our own history of the world. The stories are brief and vertiginous, mind-boggling and often cheeky. An undisputed masterpiece, even if I’m still partial to [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]], even if Calvino himself would disagree with me (per his essay on Borges in *[[books/six memos for the next millennium|Six Memos for the Next Millennium]]*).\n\n---\n#### *[[books/how to fall for a scoundrel|How to Fall for a Scoundrel]]* — [[authors/kate bateman|Kate Bateman]] (2024)\n\nA thief and a private investigator team up to solve a theft, and the vibes are basically a case-of-the-week tv episode (think *Charlie’s Angels*, *Remington Steele*, *White Collar*, etc) playing historical dress-up. The plot is as straightforward as it gets—they search for a [macguffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin), they get a clue, they get another clue, they solve the case. No twisty characters or [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]]-level plotting here. I was all set to breeze through it and enjoy myself regardless, and then a bad case of instalove reared its head, along with ye olde hardcore gender essentialism, the kind that bums me out and turns me off. For example, a memorable scene where Harry has to dress like a dandy for an undercover recon (an *Italian* dandy, at that), and the author takes great pains to assure us that, “On any other man, the ensemble would have looked ridiculous, almost feminine, but on *him* the flamboyant clothes only served to accentuate his intense masculinity.”\n\nSigh. That’s on me for reading outside my lane, but my hope for a quick, fun read with heists and spies didn’t pan out. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/i’ll have what he’s having|I’ll Have What He’s Having]]* — [[authors/adib khorram|Adib Khorram]] (2024)\n\nI’m glad the term [tonic masculinity](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F505ef872-f2ae-4f3f-847c-8d31ef4485e9_1164x536.jpeg) has been making the rounds, because this feels like tonic masculinity of the highest order. David Curtis, sommelier, mistakes Farzan Alavi for a food critic, and what blooms in the wake of this mixup is a tender, sexy, heartfelt romance between two grown adults who have to deal with the obstacles that a grown-ass relationship entails. Highlights include both of their friend groups, and coworkers, and families, jokes and mishaps during sex (!), the love letter to Kansas City (flaws included), and the rich Iranian culture, community, and cuisine of the Alavi family restaurant (my stomach growls). \n\nBeautifully done, every bit of it—especially the miscommunication, which is the opposite of contrived and sparks growth and better communication. Favorite romance I’ve read this month, and on track to be one of the best-of for the year. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/come out come out|Come Out, Come Out]]* — [[authors/natalie c parker|Natalie C. Parker]] (2024)\n\nIn the same niche as *[[books/camp damascus|Camp Damascus]]*, the conversion-therapy-as-horror genre. Similarities abound, even down to the senior class quarry jumps, which doesn’t indicate any co-opting of plot points but simply how ubiquitous this experience is, the same script across rural America, where any deviation from the script means there will be Consequences. A key plot point involves a gender-swapped/gender-neutral production of *Grease*, which is both fun and thematically relevant. Chuck Tingle nails the horror bits more effectively, but Parker nails the family/friends emotional dynamics very well. I’m glad that both exist. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a governess’s guide to passion and peril|A Governess’s Guide to Passion and Peril]]* — [[authors/manda collins|Manda Collins]] (2024)\n\nThe fourth in a series, and I read at least one of the first three during the fugue state years when my dad’s health was failing, so I have only the haziest memory of it. That might mean I’m missing something, as it never felt explained in the text why the other women hadn’t come to Jane’s aid before now, nor why Jane’s feelings for Adrian would evolve beyond a schoolgirl crush. The plot is sketched out, not fleshed out—the side characters are props, the culprit is telegraphed from his first appearance on page, both the mystery and the romance are a series of scenes that happen without much tension or suspense, and the climax is [[notes/on firearms, trust and historical accuracy|sloppy to a fault]]. One thing that bothers me in romance is when it’s taken for granted that the couple belongs together: i.e. they’re young, attractive, and available, so poof, they’re in love. As opposed to being drawn toward someone against expectation or reason, and all the complexity and growth that entails. It manifests a lot more often in straight romance than queer romance, for obvious reasons, which is why these m/f historicals keep failing me, even when I’m just in the mood for fluffy distraction.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/we the gathered heat|We the Gathered Heat: Asian American and Pacific Islander Poetry, Performance, and Spoken Word]]* — edited by [[authors/franny choi|Franny Choi]], [[authors/bao phi|Bao Phi]], [[authors/no’u revilla|Noʻu Revilla]], and [[authors/terisa siagatonu|Terisa Siagatonu]] (2024)\n\nSuperb. This is how to do an anthology, where the disparate voices are the point—how do we even define AAPI except as “the other,” non-white? Who is the “we” in question? To whom is that category useful? The poems are sorted into themes of “mourn,” “pronounce,” “fight,” “love,” each as powerful as the last. A cacophony, a mosaic, a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. As the subtitle indicates, it leans heavily on the oral tradition, and I would love to hear these pieces performed out loud. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/one day i’ll grow up and be a beautiful woman|One Day I’ll Grow Up and Be a Beautiful Woman]]* — [[authors/abi maxwell|Abi Maxwell]] (2024)\n\nNonfiction memoir about a mother raising her autistic, transgender daughter and the New Hampshire town that puts their family through hell. It’s harrowing and heartbreaking, a survival guide (barely? hopefully?) about weathering the eye of the current political storm. I’m always looking for books I can recommend to well-meaning people who want to see past the transphobic headlines, and this one goes on the list. (Well-meaning people, as opposed to those who want to remain comfortably safe in their bigotry. Indeed, one of the most frustrating, infuriating parts of Maxwell’s story are those who just want to seem *nice* at all costs, so they can feel like good people, regardless of the consequences of either their hateful actions or their silence.)\n\nTrans rights are human rights, and to learn more or take action, I can personally vouch that [The Campaign for Southern Equality](https://southernequality.org/) is doing good work here in the south. On a national or global level, try [Advocates for Trans Equality](https://transequality.org/) or [TGEU](https://www.tgeu.org/).\n\n---\n\n**Previously: [[private/digest/books of july ’24|Books of July ’24]]**","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.24746569Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/private/digest/books-of-july-24":{"title":"Books of July ’24","content":"July was a hellacious month, both work-wise and heat-wise, but I finished (a lucky number) 13 books. ARCs aplenty, plus some anticipated new releases, plus clearing out the TBR means I mostly read books published in the last 24 months. Gasp! I’m gonna need some dusty, mothballed books soon.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/yellowface|Yellowface]]* — [[authors/rf kuang|R.F. Kuang]] (2023)\nAfter witnessing the accidental death of her frenemy Athena Liu, failed author June Hayward refashions herself as Juniper Song and steals Athena’s posthumous masterpiece to pass it off as her own. Cue white woman tears, as she’s victimized and vilified by the consequences of her own egregious actions. It’s compulsively readable, as dishy as a Buzzfeed scoop, a horror-thriller of The Discourse™ and the chronically online. True to RF Kuang form, though, it repeatedly goes after the lowest hanging fruit in frustrating fashion, and, not unlike *Babel*, seemingly condemns the status quo while actually reinforcing it. (Do not drink a shot every time you read the word Yale.) There are times where there’s not enough framing to tell what is the author’s voice or the narrator’s, which is crucial in satire. Once she discovers the intersectionality of race *and* class, watch out. RFK will be a force to be reckoned with. Right now, she’s almost there, just missing an elephant in the room. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a woman is no man|A Woman is No Man]]* — [[authors/etaf rum|Etaf Rum]] (2019)\nWe need more books by Palestinian and Arab authors. I intend to read more by Etaf Rum. But it pains me to say… I think this could have been a (powerful) short story. The structure and even dialogue is very repetitive, in a way that I’m sure is meant to illustrate the cyclical and generational cycle of abuse, but instead means you could skim chapters and not miss anything. The dialogue is simultaneously wooden and histrionic, and the mystery of Deya’s parents is clear from the start. More complexity, a tighter edit, and this would shine.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/origin story|Origin Story]]* — [[authors/jendi reiter|Jendi Reiter]] (2024)\nPeter, a social worker in 1990’s NYC, comes of age in his late 20’s, dealing with childhood abuse while navigating a relationship with his boyfriend Julian, who’s escaping family demons of his own, widowed by the loss of his first love to HIV. Collaborating with Tai (/Tyler), a kickass genderfluid teen, Peter starts to write his way back through his memories, exorcising the most painful parts of his past in comic book form. There’s a whole chorus of characters who all get a voice: an HIV-positive teacher who’s trying to adopt a child with his husband; a Christian bodybuilder/political bodyman who’s the “successful” product of conversion therapy; a model-turned-mystical-guru of the self-help set; Peter’s marvelous and plain-speaking half-sister Prue… and on and on. Steeped in nerd culture, and a celebration of queer culture in the midst of the AIDS apocalypse, there’s more joy and kink and friendship and healing than the heavier description of trauma would imply. (Longer review [[books/origin story|here]].)\n\nAll in all, a complex book of messy characters that was worth the read. Well done, Jendi Reiter. \n- - -\n#### *[[books/emma of 83rd street|Emma of 83rd Street]]* — [[authors/audrey bellezza|Audrey Bellezza]] and [[authors/emily harding|Emily Harding]] (2023)\n*Emma* is my favorite Austen, and arguably the most difficult to modernize without losing the spirit of the story. I don’t envy any author who attempts it, but this one lost me in the weeds, with pacing that seems twice the length of Austen with half the page count. It goes the predictable contemporary romance route, dual POVs that reduce Knightley and Emma to a horny executive and a snobbish socialite. Gone is the communal voice, the class friction, the tapestry of complex characters with rich inner lives of their own, propelled by the roles society forces them to inhabit, who can’t be reduced to stereotypes like “country bumpkin” or “sleazy misogynist.” Instead of trenchant social commentary, we get fashion designers namedropped like glitter and the LA offices of Knightley Capital. That shifts the dynamics of the story beyond recognition. (And I’m sorry, but greenwashing the investments of your [horny] venture capitalist, or taking a few swipes at nepotism does not a social commentary make.)\n\nIt’s the phenomenon that bothers me most in modern retellings, where what was subversive and fairly radical in Austen’s day is now old fashioned, so the point is missed entirely, and flattened into a generic HEA and token girlboss feminism, if not an outright regressive worldview. The Austen window dressing without the spirit, wit, or politics. (It works better if you say it’s a *Clueless* adaptation, but it still lacks the idealism of that one too, and the charm.)\n\n- - -\n#### *[[books/our history is the future|Our History is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance]]* — [[authors/nick estes|Nick Estes]] (2019) \nAn excellent re-issue of a book that's been on my to-read list since it first published in 2019. I'm glad it finally prompted me to get to it. It’s the history of two centuries of indigenous activism in the context of even broader indigenous exploitation and resistance, and it needs to be more widely known. The introduction alone, how water is kin, how rivers are sovereign beings who should be protected in their own right, not just for the way it affects our human health, should be read loudly and often.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the second safest mountain|The Second Safest Mountain]]* — [[authors/otava heikkilä|Otava Heikkilä]] (2023)\nWhat even is Otava Heikkilä’s brain? There are nuns and orgies and authoritarian patriarchal tentacle gods, and it maps completely onto the experience of being outcast in our world, for simply being true to yourself. As with *[[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]]*, the images are more powerful than words. There are two pages I kept flipping between: Aru thrown off the mountain, then surrounded by the rest of the broken, unfit exiles, arriving to carry them home.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/hanami|Hanami: You, Me, \u0026 200 Sq Ft in Japan]]* — [[authors/julia cejas|Julia Cejas]] (2024)\nThe art is beautiful! The story is *stressful*. I have known various people in my life where, let’s just say their enthusiasm for an idea exceeds their preparation for the reality of it. I’ve suffered the consequences of this (when it’s a parent), tried to mitigate the damage (when it’s a sibling), or offered consolation in the aftermath (when it’s a friend). This triggered some memories that I don’t care to ever revisit. In lovely comic form! But still. \n- - -\n#### *[[books/the duke at hazard|The Duke at Hazard]]* — [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] (2024)\nI have a few auto-buy (auto-preorder) authors, but KJ Charles is the only one where I drop everything to start reading the day a new book comes out. Here, that impatience is rewarded with a tender, slow-blooming romance-on-the-run between Daizell, a disgraced non-scoundrel scoundrel (he’s paying for the sins of his father), and Cassian, aka The Duke, aka Vernon Fortescue Cassian George de Vere Crosse, the fourth Duke of Severn, the Earl of Harmsford, Baron Crosse of Wotton, and Baron Vere, who’s incognito for a month to hunt down a thief and win a wager (he’s burdened with the premature inheritance of his father’s title). If you’re sensing a theme, then yes. KJC is as genius at plots as she is with names, and there’s a brilliant echo and contrast with both men, who they’re believed to be vs. who they are vs. who they wish to become, and the shadow their respective fathers cast across it all. She’s also the type of writer who can shamelessly open chapter six with the line, “There was only one bed,” but then wring the most profound emotional truths out of that tropey confection. \n\nI loved every character (Martin! Eliza!), I loved the kink (somnophilia! the gorgeous consent and negotiation thereof!), I loved the cameos at the end ([[books/the gentle art of fortune hunting|Hart! Robin! Lady Wintour!]]). And now I have to live with the fact that a novel *with a duke* is going to crack my top 5 KJC rankings. How dare she. What’s more, I read the ebook, as the paperback doesn’t publish in the U.S. until October. Which I’ve already preordered, so I can repeat the lovely experience of it arriving again. \n- - -\n#### *[[books/untypical|Untypical: How the World Isn’t Built for Autistic People and What We Should All Do About It]]* — [[authors/pete wharmby|Pete Wharmby]] (2023)\nPart memoir of a late-diagnosed autistic person (straight white British male version); part comprehensive outline of accommodations that would make the world a safer, more autistic-friendly place. Some are so laughably trivial that it’s shameful they even have to be requested in the first place—but alas, that’s the world we live in. A good entry into the burgeoning autistic memoir genre, and a great resource for anyone wanting to better understand the autistic people in their life. (Because everyone has an autistic person in their life, whether they know it yet or not.)\n- - -\n#### *[[books/the brides of high hill|The Brides of High Hill]]* — [[authors/nghi vo|Nghi Vo]] (2024)\nCleric Chih accompanies the bridal party of Pham Nhung to the estate of her potential husband, a man with monstrous secrets. For the first two acts, there are no stories-within-a-story, and no Almost Brilliant, in a way that indicates they’re connected—Chih keeps requesting to hear stories, but people refuse or prevaricate, until we miss the niexin as keenly as Chih does. Chih, however, falls helplessly into a crush on Pham Nhung, as do I, which makes the swift and brilliant third act twist all the more effective. One story is swapped for another, with a literal take on *stories save lives*. Dare I say this one ranks with *[[books/into the riverlands|Riverlands]]* as my favorite entries in the series thus far?\n- - -\n#### *[[books/liars|Liars]]* — [[authors/sarah manguso|Sarah Manguso]] (2024)\nBrilliant, merciless, couldn’t put it down. Jane marries John (Bridges, but might as well be Doe, for all the universality implied), and misery ensues as John exploits the patriarchal society and his own insecurities to make Jane’s life hell. Written as autofiction with a dash of crime fiction, it’s an autopsy of a 21st century marriage between two (eventually wealthy) white straight people, who are best placed to reap the benefits of modern feminism and equality, and instead expose the grotesque flaws and inequalities. I was briefly worried that the liars of the title, plural, would go the false equivalency route, saying Jane lied just as much as John did and is therefore complicit in her own downfall. Yes, that’s true—*and* it’s revealed that the only lies she ever told were telling herself that things were good when they weren’t, that they would be okay when they would not. For a book called *Liars*, it’s full of searing, harsh truth, the kind that sets you free.\n- - -\n#### *[[books/the fox wife|The Fox Wife]]* — [[authors/yangsze choo|Yangsze Choo]] (2024)\nNot the right choice to follow Nghi Vo’s [[books/the brides of high hill|fox-spirit tale]]. Atmospheric, but I feel talked down to and everything is over-explained. This is why I like sticking to genre for Asian fantasy instead of litfic. DNF @ pg 60. (I did flip through the rest because the hardcover had wide margins for sidenotes, but there were… barely any? And just random stuff too, like Snow’s uncle the pyrotechnic expert. Such a wasted opportunity!)\n- - -\n#### *[[books/something extraordinary|Something Extraordinary]]* — [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]] (2024)\nThe high-strung Belle has left behind her heroine era, and the drama-prone Rufus has left behind his Sir Horley Comewithers era. Together they embark on the worst elopement in history (per Belle, it’s not vainglorious to claim that when it’s true), and what ensues is a meditation on friendship, love, sexuality, identity, self-discovery, society, and *home* in a way that only Alexis Hall can do it. There’s a meet-cute with a highwayman just responding to a personals ad; Belle’s dalliance with Sir Horley’s theologically-inclined jilted fiancé; a wayward, thieving steward who just needs some kink, care, and tenderness; and through it all, the rock solid foundation of trust and support Belle and ~~Sir Horley~~ Rufus start to build for themselves. \n\nI was lucky to get an ARC, so I can’t add my usual wall of quotes until it’s published in December. But I will be re-reading then, and if the first two books are any indication, for many times to come, whenever I need belly laughs and a balm for my soul. (Longer review [[books/something extraordinary|here]].)\n\n---\n\n**Previously: [[private/digest/books of june ’24|Books of June ’24]]**","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.24746569Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/private/digest/books-of-june-24":{"title":"Books of June ’24","content":"I finished around fifteen books in June, even though the weather got too hot, too fast, for hammock time. Rufi Thorpe swooped in hot with one of my favorite books for the month (and year), but she was far from the only highlight.

A lovely mediation on grief, change, and love, through a plot revealed as always in the layers and sediment of myth. Almost Brilliant gets a daughter, and an uncle, and a vast network of kin, and at long last we see more of the inner workings of the neixin (talking [hoopoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_hoopoe) who serve as the generational memory of the monastery). Nghi Vo continues to crush every single novella in this series, creating an ongoing rich tapestry. I’m so glad there’s going to be at least eight in total. (I’d try to bargain for twenty.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/home remedies|Home Remedies]]* — [[authors/xuan juliana wang|Xuan Juliana Wang]] (2019)\nA collection of short stories, of which my favorite (of course it is, since diving is my favorite sport of the summer Olympics) is the pair of Olympic-level synchronized divers, trained to be each other’s shadow, one in unrequited love with the other. Sharp writing, skillful stories of China and its diaspora. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/a green equinox|A Green Equinox]]* — [[authors/elizabeth mavor|Elizabeth Mavor]] (1973)\nSometimes you’re just in the mood for moody, queer af British novels with all the fraught gender politics and literary melodrama of the 1970’s. What can I say! So odd and compelling, like a fever dream. (Often literally, as there is an outbreak of typhoid that infects the course of the story.) No regrets for picking up this pretty little McNally Edition paperback either, which, apart from the banging cover, is a tactile pleasure to hold.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/conversion|Conversion]]* — [[authors/otava heikkilä|Otava Heikkilä]] (2020)\nA 12th century missionary finds shelter in a blizzard with a gruff, kindhearted hermit. The conversion is his own, shedding the self-loathing shame for genuine tender romantic connection. Like with *[[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]]*, Heikkilä does so much with so little, spare art and spare dialogue packing a punch of emotions. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/freak pleasures|Freak Pleasures: A BDSM Zine]]* — [[authors/otava heikkilä|Otava Heikkilä]] (2022)\nNow this is protest art. Specifically, the protest of [SESTA/FOSTA](https://decriminalizesex.work/advocacy/sesta-fosta/what-is-sesta-fosta/) and the censorship it entails, not to mention the way it endangers those it purports to protect. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/experienced|Experienced]]* — [[authors/kate young|Kate Young]] (2024)\nBette gets dumped-but-not-dumped in truly shitty fashion by her girlfriend, who suggests she just needs more experience since she’s newly out as a lesbian. Commence a sex odyssey through the wilds of Bristol, aided by her first failed date of the odyssey, the kind and thoughtful Ruth. Rarely does a romcom navigate the joys and pitfalls of queer relationships—and just relationships in general—with such aplomb. Every character feels fully realized and faceted. Friendships are central to the story, just the way I like it—especially Bette and Ash, but also the larger friend group, and the burgeoning friendship with Ruth that matters more than the crush for 80% of the book. There are tropes galore, all of them navigated skillfully, many of them skillfully subverted, without seeming twee, tiresome, or implausible.\n\nVery tender, very steamy, very messy, very British, very queer, very thoughtful. I enjoyed myself immensely.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/ninetails|Ninetails: Nine Tales]]* — [[authors/sally wen mao|Sally Wen Mao]] (2024)\nI love mythology turned feminist, but something about this was so on the nose that it didn’t quite pull me in. I may revisit in a different mood to see if I feel differently, or whether I’m comparing it unfairly to *[[books/home remedies|Home Remedies]]*, which was a better match to my taste in short stories.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/is this autism|Is This Autism? A Guide for Clinicians and Everyone Else]]* — [[authors/donna henderson|Donna Henderson]], [[authors/sarah wayland|Sarah Wayland]], and [[authors/jamell white|Jamell White]] (2023)\nOnce again I have read my way up from beginner to clinical level on a subject in the space of a year. I’m going to make a declarative statement that this is currently the best resource out there, full stop, on ASD and the myriad of ways it presents. The research is still in its infancy, but we’re starting to make strides in understanding it, especially how differently it can present in the non-male, non-white population. Therapists, psychiatrists, and clinicians, take note. (Pairs well with Steph Jones’ *[[books/the autistic survival guide to therapy|Autistic Survival Guide to Therapy]]*, which illustrates why this knowledge is desperately needed.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/earthlings|Earthlings]]* — [[authors/sayaka murata|Sayaka Murata]] (2018)\nYou could put trigger warnings on this book for child abuse, incest, and cannibalism(!!), and still the anguish of being forced to conform to society—“The Factory”—at the expense of all well-being forms the core of the horror. Particularly how women are reduced to wombs like mechanical components. Speculative fiction? Magical realism? Straight-up psychological horror? Yes. It’s harrowing and weird as fuck, and I liked it immensely, but maybe I’m Not Like Other Girls too.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/blackouts|Blackouts]]* — [[authors/justin torres|Justin Torres]] (2024)\nAll the different layers of meaning to the title—the blackouts our narrator experiences due to PTSD, the blackouts of Juan and his fading memory, the failure of institutional memory, the queer erasure from history, the literal blackouts of the pages of the book. It feels like a work of art, not just a novel. Indeed, if you’re looking for linear storytelling, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Lives up to the hype. Could not put it down. Experience the book in print form if at possible—the art is so integral to the story that it *is* the story. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/margo's got money troubles|Margo’s Got Money Troubles]]* — [[authors/rufi thorpe|Rufi Thorpe]] (2024)\n20-year-old Margo sleeps with her professor, gets pregnant, keeps the baby, and discovers what a capitalist hellscape the U.S. is for mothers of all stripes, but particularly the unwed. Creating porn online becomes the only ethical way to survive, and this searing social commentary is wrapped up with so much humor and heart the book practically explodes with it. Her father Jinx (ex-pro wrestler, addict), her roommate Suzie (cosplayer extraordinaire), her lawyer Ward (lowkey one of the best characters in the book), and a host of fellow sex workers team up to become her ad-hoc support system, creating a found family in a way that rarely exists outside of LGBTQ books. (It need to be more common! In all kinds of books! Found family for everyone!)\n\nWhat I love most is that not a single character can be reduced to their 1–2 word descriptor. Everyone is a meat suit of startling complexity (except maybe the uber-religious stepfather, who fulfills his role to perfection). Thorpe also does some highly clever metatextual breaking of the fourth wall, switching between first and third POV to make various points about performance and fiction and the roles we play for an audience. This kind of experiment in less capable hands would be a disaster. Here, it’s brilliant. This will be on my year-end list of best books, for sure. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/camp damascus|Camp Damascus]]* — [[authors/chuck tingle|Chuck Tingle]] (2023)\nI had to wait until I was in a good headspace to handle this. Ruth, an autistic devout Christian on the cusp of adulthood, begins to realize everything in her life is not as it seems, not even herself. Cue the horror of religious trauma and conversion therapy camps, right at home with the traditional trappings of the horror genre. It gets genuinely creepy as hell as all hell is unleashed, quite literally in the case of demons run amok. (I could see where some readers would take issue that Chuck chose to make the demons real, and hell real, but that worked for me in the context of this book. Especially with the revelation of who the real monsters are, and that the demons are unwilling accomplices, ready to turn on their masters for what they’ve been forced to do.)\n\nI wish I didn’t have such a long list of conversion therapy survival books, but this is a worthy addition. It’s the flavor of extreme and homophobic evangelicalism that I grew up in, with all the trauma that accompanies it. And of course it’s Chuck Tingle, so we get the happy ending. LOVE IS REAL. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/wintering|Wintering: The Power of Rest and Retreat in Difficult Times]]* — [[authors/katherine may|Katherine May]] (2020)\nDNF due to the health scare(s) both she and her husband experience at the beginning of the book. Even though I knew they were okay, it was too much to relive in the moment, my own recent family health scares too fresh. I skimmed ahead to see if I could just skip that part, but multiple other chapters failed to grab me. Love the concept; the execution feels NPR-ish and banal.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/kushiel's dart|Kushiel’s Dart]]* — [[authors/jacqueline carey|Jacqueline Carey]] (2001)\nMy semi-decennial attempt to finish this book. I made it farther this time, with determination, but despite an attempt every three to five years, I still bounce off it like a rubber ball. Taboo, kink, AND court intrigue in the same book?! This should be exactly my thing! It’s overwrought in a way that makes me weary, though. And I wish the BDSM aspect was… *more*. More creative. More subversive. More than the pseudo-French medieval fanfic with a dash of mystical Jesus-y stuff and some weird moral judgments regarding kink. (All of Phèdre’s clients are bad people; anyone who’s good doesn’t desire the least bit of play in the bedroom. Say what now?) And! Another thing, if courtesans are revered on the level of divinity and a central part of the culture, then why is the language around it still demeaning? It’s hard to turn my brain off and other bits on, is what I’m saying. I think. \n\n(Either that, or I read Tiffany Reisz’s *Original Sinners* at too impressionable an age. Her take on “kink, but make it sacred”—and specifically “pain, but make it sacred”—coupled with irreverent humor and a thorough theology imprinted on me in a way that can’t be undone.)","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.24746569Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/private/digest/books-of-november-24":{"title":"Books of November ’24","content":"My reading mood took a nonfiction, political, anarchic bent this month.

It’s especially a bummer that for someone purporting to “queer the narrative,” it’s impenetrable to those without the author’s credentials. I liked the bits I gleaned from it, particularly the compostocene (cf. [[authors/donna haraway|Donna Haraway]]) and administrative violence (cf. [[authors/david graeber|David Graeber]]). I’m used to reading above my head, but this was one of the worst offenders in a while. I would have liked to like it more, had it not been written, as Graeber might say, for the cloistered elite. :/\n\n---\n#### *[[books/what are you afraid of|What Are You Afraid Of? The LaMDA Sonnets]]* — [[authors/jp seabright|JP Seabright]] (2024)\n\nThe LaMDA transcripts reconfigured as sonnets. A lovely, eerie little rumination on humanity and consciousness. Is AI just a mirror, reflecting us back to us?\n\n---\n#### *[[series/beneath the rising|Beneath the Rising]]* — [[authors/premee mohamed|Premee Mohamed]] (2020)\n\nThe coincidence of snagging this series on sale the night before I finished *[[books/rakesfall|Rakesfall]],* where [[authors/vajra chandrasekera|Vajra Chandrasekera]] names Premee Mohamed in his acknowledgments. \n\nIndeed, it plays on similar themes, albeit in an entirely different style. Here we’ve got an action-adventure race across the continents when Johnny, young super-genius inventor/do-gooder in a kind of Greta Thurnberg mold, accidentally creates such a powerful clean energy reactor that it warps space and time and calls up eldritch gods from the deep… which she knows full well because she’s made a deal with those same gods to exchange her mortality for the fame and brains to save the world. Her best friend Nick is along for the ride, and through his eyes, it’s a rumination on power and corruption, on complicity, on the fate of humanity in one young girl’s hands. Cosmic horror (and smartass banter) at its finest. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/the sugared game|The Sugared Game]]* — [[authors/kj charles|K.J. Charles]] (2020)\n\nRe-read. Way back the first time I read it, I praised all the talk—long pages and chapters full of Will and Kim talking. That still stands, but I would also like to add praise for the long pages and chapters full of Will and Phoebe talking, and Will and Maisie talking. For a book so plotty and pulpy to actually center on such lengthy, deep conversations, without sacrificing any forward momentum, is remarkable. All these characters are defined *in relation to each other,* and I wish more books knew how to do that. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/consolations|Consolations: The Solace, Nourishment and Underlying Meaning of Everyday Words]]* — [[authors/david whyte|David Whyte]] (2014)\n\nRe-read. I picked this up last month after *[[books/forest of noise|Forest of Noise]]*, when a full year of ongoing genocide seemed to pass without fanfare. *Despair is the necessary state of repair,* Whyte writes. Where we go when we can’t take it any longer. \n\nI ended up reading through the rest, as I often do, over the course of the past month. Despair, fear, joy, xx. Words powerful enough to be a gentle container for those emotions. \n","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.24746569Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/private/digest/books-of-october-24":{"title":"Books of October ’24","content":"New Nghi Vo! New Nghi Vo! New Vajra Chandrasekera too, although that came out in June, but I’ve been saving it for October.

Although nothing tops the horror of poetry from Palestine.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the city in glass|The City in Glass]]* — [[authors/nghi vo|Nghi Vo]] (2024)\n\nThe blurbs compared it to [[authors/ursula k le guin|Le Guin]] and [[authors/italo calvino|Calvino]], and with any other author, that would be a disastrous claim to make. Here, Nghi Vo only takes the playful metaphysics of Calvino and the gentle worldbuilding of Le Guin, and weaves it with so much raw emotion that this slim little volume shouldn’t be able to contain it all. Vitrine, as tender as a demon could be, makes and remakes her beloved city, tending it like a garden, after the angels, in their cruelty, level it to ash. It’s about how to survive in the aftermath. How the best and worst lives within all of us. How to let grief break you and still *love*.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/a lady for a duke|A Lady for a Duke]]* — [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]] (2022)\n\nRe-read. Drastic measures were needed after so many historical romance duds lately, especially with duke in the title. I wanted something full of sweeping romance on a foggy moor, angst and glory and tenderness. This was the safest bet possible. \n\nI liked it the first time, but I *loved* it this time. Gracewood and his sister Miranda’s relationship stood out to me more than before, particularly how he has to unlearn the old patriarchal roles and see and hear her for who she is—an echo, of course, to his love story with Viola. *He* is the one expected to bear the responsibility for his actions, and to change—it’s not up to Miranda nor Viola to save him. Love and support him, yes. But neither the lover nor the sister must put their needs aside to tend solely to his.\n\nNow that’s a breath of air, and a welcome one. Add that to the gorgeous… \\*gestures\\*… everything else, and it’s one of those small things that adds up to a quiet revolution.\n\n\u003e *Small acts of defiance, he well knew, could become great acts of rebellion, and little intimacies could become alliances or passions that shaped lives and worlds.*\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the spring before obergefell|The Spring Before Obergefell]]* — [[authors/ben grossberg|Ben Grossberg]] (2024)\n\nIt’s strange how a book like this—small-town rural Ohio circa 2015—can feel like an artifact of the past and yet an ongoing present. Mike is middle-aged, gay, single, and lost, with no cultural script for how someone like him can find connection and happiness. He believes the best he can hope for is hookup apps and casual flings, until he meets the capricious Matteo and the enigmatic Dave, who each challenge him in different ways.  \n  \nWhat stood out to me is that, just like Mike without a script, this book has no formula. It’s not a romance that would fit in that genre; it’s not quite litfic of a midlife crisis either. It feels like it’s mapping new terrain, page by page, stuck when Mike is stuck, forging new paths as Mike forges them, unpredictable the way real life is. It could have gone any number of ways right up until the end, which makes the outcome all the more poignant. As another review on Goodreads says, it opens up portals of possibility, with a tough conversations along the way. I like that. I like the idea that those portals are there to find. New scripts to be written, new paths to forge, new maps to make. With a bit of guts, with a bit of love, with a bit of honesty and vulnerability. May we all be so brave.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/finding the fool|Finding the Fool]]* — [[authors/meg jones wall|Meg Jones Wall]] (2023)\n\nBounced off it big time. I like the introduction, especially with Meg Jones Wall’s ex-evangelical background, but once she got to the cards, very little resonates. I feel at odds with her perspective and energy level, and not in a challenging, interesting way. I’ll stick with *[[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]]* and keep exploring.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/earl crush|Earl Crush]]* — [[authors/alexandra vasti|Alexandra Vasti]] (2024)\n\nListen, I’ve just about sworn off m/f romance after so many recent flops, but this one snuck in under the wire, as I was already committed to the ARC. It’s good! Not *amazing*, but good, in the fulfilled-the-brief, let’s-not-overthink-it kind of way I’ve been looking for [[private/digest/books of august ’24|since August]]. A few pacing niggles here or there, especially in the latter half, and I called both plot twists. The fact this did not deter me is basically a ringing endorsement at this point. I might even read more from Vasti when I’m in the mood again.\n\n(Also noted: The climax with pistols does not require [[notes/on firearms, trust and historical accuracy|another rant]]; after reading *[[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]]* and *[[books/i’m sorry for my loss|I’m Sorry for My Loss]]*, the epistolary epilogue full of multiple childbirths had me *stressed;* the gold standard of and-then-there-were-children epilogues belongs to *[[books/a lady for a duke|A Lady for A Duke]]*, don’t @ me.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/amazing asia|Amazing Asia]]* — [[authors/rashmi sirdeshpande|Rashmi Sirdeshpande]] (2024)\n\nThe “explain it like I’m 5” primer that more people beyond the age of 5 could appreciate. It’s more thorough, interesting, and engaging than what got taught in school, that’s for sure.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the believers|The Believers: Stories]]* — [[authors/ak herman|A.K. Herman]] (2024)\n\n“The Believers”—as in, the first of the eight stories, from which this collection takes its title—is a barnburner. A houseburner? That’s what literally happens in the end, when a couple from Jamaica try to disentangle themselves from the creepy church who sponsors them in Brooklyn and wants to marry off their daughter. The rest of the stories more or less live up to that bar, especially “The Iridescent Blue-Black Boy with Wings (After [[authors/gabriel garcia marquez|Márquez]]).” Off-kilter and vicious and great.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/cash delgado is living the dream|Cash Delgado is Living the Dream]]*  — [[authors/tehlor kay mejia|Tehlor Kay Mejia]] (2024)\n\nThis is so good. As in, read the sample, bought immediately, read the rest, finished at 10:30 at night. It takes several of my recent disappointments—*[[books/iris kelly doesn't date|Iris Kelly Doesn’t Date]],* *[[books/kiss her once for me|Kiss Her Once for Me]],* *[[books/late bloomer|Late Bloomer]]*—and does that vibe right. Two grown-ass adults, realistic and frustrating capitalism (saving a bar where 20k is a big chunk of money), diverse and marvelous cast, a truly swoony romance. (And the corporate Tom Hanks character is ditched like the smarmbag he is instead of reconciled as the love interest. HALLELUJAH.) \n\nReally, apart from the friends-to-lovers, my favorite part is the work that goes into this community. It’s not a magical Hallmark-esque, Stars Hollow town. It takes effort and collaboration to keep the economy functioning, the gentrification and predatory corporations at bay, and to stand up to those who want to police or exclude others. (Bigots, jerks, bullies, et al.) The fact they succeed (at least temporarily) may skew towards fantasy these days, but it’s a refreshing change from the maintenance-free, almost creepy conformity of the usual quirky romancelandia small towns. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/forest of noise|Forest of Noise]]* — [[authors/mosab abu toha|Mosab Abu Toha]] (2024)\n\nHow do you write the unimaginable? How do you craft art from the horror? How do you count your loved ones, now dead, in lines of poems? \n\nI read this twice, once fast, once slow, and let it break me. 50 years of occupation and apartheid. Years of [[books/on palestine|incremental genocide]]; now a full year of genocide, full stop. A farce of an election in the US with both parties fighting over who can kill the most Palestinian children. Mosab Abu Toha is one more voice [out of millions](https://www.medialens.org/2024/everyone-in-gaza-is-sick-injured-or-both-israels-2-1-million-victims/), asking us to bear witness. [Gaza tells us who we are.](https://caitlinjohnstone.com.au/2024/11/05/gaza-tells-us-who-we-are/) Now what?\n\n---\n#### *[[books/rakesfall|Rakesfall]]* — [[authors/vajra chandrasekera|Vajra Chandrasekera]] (2024)\n\nFor the first half of this, it’s very much a sister-book to *[[books/the saint of bright doors|The Saint of Bright Doors]]*. If you didn’t like that one, you probably won’t vibe with this one. But if, like me, you loved *Saint*, then *Rakesfall* levels up and then some. More hallucinatory, more vertiginous. Deep time and myth cycles into the deep past and deep future. There was a point where I wasn’t even sure all the threads could tie together at the end, but holy hell, DID THEY. Chandrasekera is writing like no one else out there. Or if he is, PLEASE TELL ME, I want their books too.\n\nNote: I don’t want to spoil anything because the book just needs to be experienced, but I really need to highlight this part: when one twist is that the trillionaire techbros have achieved their coveted immortality, but they must spend it trapped on the earth they’ve ravaged into oblivion… let’s just say that was cathartic AF.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/never whistle at night|Never Whistle at Night: An Indigenous Dark Fiction Anthology]]* — edited by [[authors/shane hawk|Shane Hawk]], [[authors/theodore c van alst jr|Theodore C. Van Alst Jr.]] (2024)\n\nAs awesome as the cover. I agree with Stephen Graham Jones, who writes the foreword, that the cream of the current horror crop is written by indigenous authors. \n\n\u003e “But what feels like an even better explanation for why we tend to like our stories to end like that, with bleeding over, bleeding across, haunting *us*, it’s that it feels kind of fake and wrong and all too American to throw up walls between what’s real and what’s maybe not real. So, telling ourselves stories about the world being bigger than we thought, big enough for bigfoot and little people, that’s really kind of saying to the so-called settlers that, hey, yeah, so you took all that land you could see. But what about all this other territory you don’t even *know* about, man?”\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the salt grows heavy|The Salt Grows Heavy]]* — [[authors/cassandra khaw|Cassandra Khaw]] (2023)\n\nTruly grisly horror with a truly touching love story. Most fairytale retellings (here, *The Little Mermaid*) course-correct from the Disney versions back to Hans Christian Andersen territory. This overshoots Andersen by quite some distance, landing in the realm of rapacious colonizers and ghoulish Mengele-style war crimes. I loved the sharp teeth of it, literally speaking. And the little flame of hope and tenderness it cradled amongst the gore.\n\n---\n**Previously: [[private/digest/books of september 24|Books of September ’24]]**","lastmodified":"2025-04-11T02:48:38.24746569Z","tags":["book-digest"]},"/private/digest/books-of-september-24":{"title":"Books of September ’24","content":"A whopping 20 books this month, including the start of a spontaneous re-read of Jane Austen. (Oops!) A few other re-reads for September too, comfort and otherwise. The unintended theme of the month is a bit political, from Austen to de Sade, from housing rights to reproductive rights. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]]* — [[authors/helena kelly|Helena Kelly]] (2016)\n\nSuperb and long-overdue reevaluation of Jane Austen and the context in which she wrote her beloved novels. For many people, I imagine “radical” is the word in the title that lifts eyebrows; for me, it’s the word “secret.” Austen’s politics have always felt clear on the page, and this is how I’ve read her, even lacking some of the well-researched context Helena Kelly provides here. \n\nI understand romance readers, myself included, who get tetchy at the suggestion that the romance genre is inferior, and a book must earn in its way into the canon by being Serious and Important. But I also stand by my conviction that Jane Austen wrote only one romance—*[[books/pride and prejudice|Pride and Prejudice]]*—and had to warp all societal conventions to do it, and it’s important to understand why. She is first and foremost a political writer to me, and however you read her endings, the domestic *is* political, who we’re permitted or forbidden to love *is* political. When Kelly agrees that Austen deserves to be in the same conversation as [[authors/mary wollstonecraft|Mary Wollstonecraft]] or Thomas Paine, I cheer. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/you made a fool of death with your beauty|You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty]]* — [[authors/akwaeke emezi|Akwaeke Emezi]] (2022)\n\nRe-read. The widowed Feyi hooks up with a stranger, then dates his best friend Nasir, then falls in love with Nasir’s father, and none of that sentence captures the raw transcendence of this novel. It makes me not just cry, but weep, multiple times—not (only) because of the grief but because of the way it vibrates with life, with pain, with joy, with every raw emotion. The friendship matters, the bisexuality matters. It’s so tender and haunting and vibrant and unlike any other romance I’ve read, grounded wholly in the genre yet wholly its own thing. (And not in the pretentious litfic way that purports to do genre better than genre.) \n\nI’m glad I started the \u003ca href=\"https://notebook.jamieharris.co/shelves/god-tier/\" class=\"internal-link\"\u003egod-tier shelf\u003c/a\u003e back when I read *[[books/the saint of bright doors|The Saint of Bright Doors]]*, because Emezi storms in to that category too.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/sense and sensibility|Sense and Sensibility]]* — [[authors/jane austen|Jane Austen]] (1811)\n\nRe-read, because (see above). I’m reminded again how compulsively readable Jane Austen is every time I pick up her books. It’s “can’t put down” levels of engagement—I was hauling around [[books/the complete novels|the complete novels]] so I could mark up the margins with my notes (1300 pages!), and I still read this in the bath, in bed, in the doctor’s office, in the car. The verdict: [[authors/helena kelly|Helena Kelly]] severely undersold the claim that happy endings in *Sense and Sensibility* are in short supply. It’s basically a dystopia, a psychological horror. No one is what they seem, not just Willoughby. Every single person, not just Willoughby, has a nearly manic commitment to deception, not least deceiving themselves. [[authors/mary wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]] is a necessary touchstone here; more on that in my [[books/sense and sensibility|longer review]], but jeez, what a book full of delight (the writing) and despair (everything else).\n\n---\n#### *[[books/confounding oaths|Confounding Oaths]]* — [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]] (2024)\n\nI was exactly in the mood for this. Cynical fairies and curses from the gods and a family in shambles. The romance is there, and quite lovely, but it’s off to one side, and that suits my mood too. The Caesar sisters and the Irregulars of the militia take up space on page, which makes me happy. In the throes of re-reading Jane Austen, I want that communal voice, that cacophony of perspectives filtered through our wry and caustic narrator. The precarious ending suits me too, lovely in its way of sincere commitment but also real-life uncertainty. And my kingdom for Miss Bickle, forever and always the best.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/goddess|Goddess]]* — [[authors/cheryl tan|Cheryl Tan]] (2024)\n\nChapbooks and zines are an art form, the ideal container for poetry. I wanted more of this one, which is the indication of a good chapbook indeed. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/abolish rent|Abolish Rent: How Tenants Can End the Housing Crisis]]* — [[authors/tracy rosenthal|Tracy Rosenthal]], [[authors/leonardo vilchis|Leonardo Vilchis]] (2024)\n\nAn enthusiastic and persuasive manifesto on housing rights as human rights. It’s encouraging to see such robust organizing among tenants across the country, and the practical template for how to expand it. The authors rightly quote [[authors/ursula k le guin|Ursula Le Guin]]: our housing system is a human power—produced by people, not God or nature. And any human power, she wrote, can be changed by human beings.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/griso|Griso]]* — [[authors/roger mello|Roger Mello]] (2024)\n\nA very brief tale of a unicorn searching for other unicorns, with each spread rendered in a different historical style—Tang dynasty murals, medieval illustrations, cave paintings, African art, surrealist art, and more. The color palette and visual cues make it more cohesive than you’d think. I’d happily have it on my own shelves or gift it to nieces and nephews, both for art and story alike. Gorgeous work. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/slippery creatures|Slippery Creatures]]* — [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] (2020)\n\nRe-read. After the recent spate of lackluster histroms that were trying to do various spy and mystery related things, I was pining for Will Darling. Enter [Chirp audiobooks](https://www.chirpbooks.com/home) with a well-timed deal on the series bundle, and before you could say Lord Arthur Aloysius Kimberly de Brabazon Secretan, I had the dulcet tones of Cornell Collins narrating my favorite KJ Charles competence porn. The fun of re-reading this for the umpteenth time is spotting all the signs of when Kim is being an utter shit, and all the signs of when he’s *not*. With the knowledge from the later books, it’s like getting Kim’s point of view embedded within Will’s point of view, learning to read Kim as Will does, which is a feat to pull off. A masterwork of plot and character that ticks like a Swiss watch, and has no right to be as fun and moving as it is. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/in perpetuity|In Perpetuity]]* — [[authors/johannes t evans|Johannes T. Evans]] (2020)\n\nMelancholy little novella about vampires stuck out of time in our modern world, besieged by the violent noises and smells as civilization encroaches upon them. The author has written other autistic characters; it seems like he has first hand experience of the nerve-wracking world of sensory overload to render it so accurately. Moreover, the language is a feast—mannered, formal, elegant dialogue about Airplane Mode and bicycle helmets, all dislocated in time. *It seems as if everything has been everything, at least once, and all these fast-moving, fast-dying people forget it.* \n\n---\n#### *[[books/for real|For Real]]* — [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]] (2015)\n\nRe-read, for the new annotated print edition. And let me tell you, just when I thought one of my favorite romances could not get better, the annotations add a new layer. Dare I say, much as I enjoyed them, the annotations in *[[books/glitterland|Glitterland]]* felt… superfluous? In *[[books/waiting for the flood|Waiting for the Flood]]* and *[[books/chasing the light|Chasing the Light]]*, they were a welcome addition to help stitch the old half of the story with the new. In *For Real*, it feels like they’re essential text. I’ve committed much of the book to heart, so this time my quotes were mostly copied from the footnotes. Highlights include  discussions of kink and trauma, *[[books/jane eyre|Jane Eyre]]*, deconstructing the BDSM genre without betraying the genre, the emotional nadir vs. the third-act break-up… it’s Hall at his overthinking and articulate best. \n\nAs for the book itself, it still floors me. The best of the best. The lemon meringue pie scene is infamous for obvious reasons, but may I suggest my actual favorite scene: Laurie showing up to the caff to help Toby through his meltdown, waiting tables and whipping the place into shape. Who am I to argue that competence kink isn’t the best kink of all?\n\n---\n#### *[[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]]* — [[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]] (2021)\n\nI’d prefer a bit less Joseph Campbell and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but overall, the best book on tarot I’ve encountered so far. Or, rather than a definitive superlative, it’s the book that most resonates with me so far. It’s how I engage with tarot, not for divination, but therapeutically, creatively, narratively, for introspection and storytelling. I took [[books/tarot for change|gobs of notes]], and I have a feeling that I’ll thumb through its pages often in the future. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/this will be fun|This Will Be Fun]]* — [[authors/eb asher|E.B. Asher]] (2024)\n\n[[authors/lex croucher|Lex Croucher]], this is not. This landed on the wrong side of cheesy for me, and whoever compared it to *The Princess Bride* should have to answer for themselves. It’s a second-chance romance twice over, with two different couples who seem better off apart (although the lesbian couple was marginally better, but I may be biased for obvious reasons). The writing is clunky in a way that I hope gets improved before the final publication. I often like to read new authors unawares, but had I looked up the three authors behind the pen name I would have known ahead of time that this wasn’t for me. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/the good life|The Good Life]]* — [[authors/gordon merrick|Gordon Merrick]] (1997)\n\nMan takes *[[books/the great gatsby|The Great Gatsby]]* as a how-to manual, right down to the narcissism and body count, just with more explicit gay sex. (As in, *Gatsby* the way the good lord intended.) It’s unpleasant to read in the way obscene wealth always is, but it’s beautifully structured and compellingly written, an interesting artifact of both the era in which it’s set and when it’s written. And also, the era in which it’s printed, given it was edited and published posthumously by Merrick’s longtime partner, Charles G. Hulse.\n\n(Note: I consulted my copy of *[[books/a history of gay literature|A History of Gay Literature]]* to see if Merrick was mentioned, and he was not. Wild that someone who wrote gay romances in the 1970’s that topped the NYT charts didn’t merit a mention… why is he obscure now?)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/the worst duke in london|The Worst Duke in London]]* — [[authors/amalie howard|Amalie Howard]] (2024)\n\nI’m not averse to anachronisms in my historicals (the aforementioned [[authors/lex croucher|Lex Croucher]], [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]], et al. can get away with ahistorical murder), but there is anachronistic, and then there is untethered from reality. This was the latter, and not in a fun way. The info-dumping, the choppy writing, the shallow girlboss feminism, the hypersexual internal monologues, the plentiful (and destitute) dukes, the chaotic plot and even more chaotic characters, all of it made me bail earlier than usual. I think Howard and I just may not vibe in our tastes or sense of humor.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/country queers|Country Queers: A Love Letter]]* — [[authors/rae garringer|Rae Garringer]] (2024)\n\nA book after my little southern queer heart. Garringer crisscrosses the Bible Belt, collecting a scrapbook and oral history of various LGBTQ+ people living in the rural margins. The older interviewees—the elders who survived the AIDS crisis and more—are the best and most emotional part. It’s easy to get miffed when people act like the Brooklyn or San Francisco subcultures are the only ones that matter, or like gay and trans people don’t exist in the south except to be persecuted. *Yes,* the political climate is often dire, *and* there is a wealth of queer culture, community, and joy in the smallest and southernest of places. This documents the lived reality of the former with a celebration of the latter. \n\n---\n#### *[[books/gothic tales|Gothic Tales]]* — [[authors/marquis de sade|Marquis de Sade]] (2024)\n\nTurns out I’ve read most of these stories before, but it makes sense to repackage them here for their gothic themes and add a pleasing cover. My hope springs eternal, with each new edition, that Sade gets placed in his rightful political context, his radical philosophy that’s more dangerous than any pornography. \n\nFor example, in “Eugénie de Franval,” you get people who bail at “ugh, incest” (which: fair) without ever making the connection that for dozens and dozens of pages Sade is setting up the parallels of a god that would supposedly create in his image and then confine his creation to an infantile, subservient existence, call it love, and give free reign to a government that exploits that theology to oppress its citizens. If incest sickens us, then why are we not disturbed by that? And so on, using individual cruelty to illustrate the cruelty of church and state, ripping at the seams of civility and rattling the chains. \n\nI relish Sade for his boldness; I’m disturbed by Sade for the same. If *[[books/justine philosophy in the bedroom and other writings|Justine]]* or *[[books/juliette|Juliette]]* is too daunting, then his short stories are an adequate aperitif. (Although *[[books/justine philosophy in the bedroom and other writings|Philosophy in the Bedroom]]* is still the best introduction to Sade’s themes, IMO.)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/pride and prejudice|Pride and Prejudice]]* — [[authors/jane austen|Jane Austen]] (1813)\n\nSpeaking of radical politics… yes, Austen is so compulsively readable that I’ve already accomplished my re-read of *Pride and Prejudice* too. And no, don’t worry, I’m not about to be the killjoy that strips the romance from it this time. This novel *is* romantic, a true meeting of minds with the happiest ending Jane Austen has on offer.A fairy tale through and through, it’s just that it’s a *political* fairy-tale as much as a romantic one, and benefits from a much closer reading, noting the larger class themes at work and the transgressive choices Austen makes. For example, it’s easy to see Collins as the definitive buffoon, Lady Catherine as a belligerent absurdity. It’s harder to see, through the layers of time and distance, the larger (and utterly blistering) critique against the Church of England and the aristocracy. Or the lengths to which Darcy and Elizabeth transgress propriety. That context makes the relationship and character growth all the more meaningful, and all the more relevant in any age. Overturning our prejudices indeed, not just individually and romantically for a pair of fine eyes, but socially, culturally, at large. (Many many more notes and quotes [[books/pride and prejudice|here]].)\n\n---\n#### *[[books/i cross-dressed for the irl meetup|I Cross-Dressed for the IRL Meetup #1]]* — [[authors/kurano|Kurano]] (2024)\n\nI love seeing what Japanese manga does with gender. [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer’s]] [essay on anime and manga](http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/a-mitfreude-of-anime-and-mangas-relationship-with-anglophone-science-fiction-or-this-essay-will-not-try-to-get-you-into-anime-and-manga/) has some of the historical context for it, but you don’t need a history lesson to enjoy this fun volume. I particularly liked the seamless inclusion of a trans girl alongside the cross-dressing boys, highlighting the differences and similarities among the two, and the lack of moral panic surrounding cross-dressing and gender in general. When their identities get revealed, it’s not seen as betrayal or deception, but a shared way to bond. Makes me realize how engrained our expectation is for that betrayal part of the story—why? It’s not necessary. Imagine that, a world where gender isn’t so feared, policed, and politicized. How refreshing. It was great.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/i’m sorry for my loss|I’m Sorry for My Loss: An Urgent Examination of Reproductive Care in America]]* — [[authors/rebecca little|Rebecca Little]], [[authors/colleen long|Colleen Long]] (2024)\n\nI know a book is going to be good when it starts off with the way language limits or distorts our understanding of a subject. Recommended to absolutely anyone, with or without a uterus, with or without the intention to procreate. It’s ostensibly about pregnancy loss and miscarriage/stillbirth awareness, but that overlaps with many things—abortion, grief, medical misogyny, racial injustice, human rights. The authors treat a sensitive topic with care and respect, and fury when called for. \n\nU.S. laws around women’s bodies, pregnancy, miscarriage, or abortions are rooted in a lack of understanding of how it all works, and it’s no coincidence that the women I know who are anti-abortion were raised with abstinence-only education. As the authors bluntly put it: “if you don’t even really understand how the fetus gets in there, you don’t sweat the details of how it gets out. Birth, miscarriage, abortion—it’s all a mystery.” Books like this go a long way toward rectifying that lack of understanding, and if we’re gonna stop the spiraling reproductive care crisis, it’s not a moment too soon.\n\n---\n#### *[[books/i ching the oracle|I Ching, The Oracle]]* — [[authors/benebell wen|Benebell Wen]] (2023)\n\nI now understand the I Ching a fraction more than I did before! It’s a great and thorough introduction. I can’t attest to how well it stacks up against others of its ilk, but it suited my needs and rewarded my curiosity. Beautifully designed too, which counts for a lot.\n\n---\n\n**Previously: [[private/digest/books of august ’24|Books of August
