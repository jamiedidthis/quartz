Queen Elizabeth proclaimed a set of laws designed to maintain order and contribute to the general good of the kingdom: **the English Poor Laws**. ¬†These laws remained in force for more than 250 years with only minor changes. Essentially, the laws distinguished ==three major categories of dependents: the vagrant, the involuntary unemployed, and the helpless==. The laws also set forth ways and means for dealing with each category of dependents. Most important, the laws established the parish (i.e.,local government), acting through an overseer of the poor appointed by local officials, as the administrative unit for executing the law.\n\u003e\n\u003e The poor laws gave the local government the power to raise taxes as needed and use the funds to build and maintain almshouses; to provide indoor relief (i.e., cash or sustenance) for the aged, handicapped and other ==worthy poor==; and the tools and materials required to put the unemployed to work.

And the American settlers of the time considered Indians and Hispanics to be inferior and therefore deserving of cultivation. The settlers considered the United States to be the best possible way to organize a country so they felt the need ==to remake the world in the image of their own country==.\n\nMany Americans believed that ==God blessed the growth of American nation== and even demanded of them to actively work on it. Since they were sure of ==their cultural and racial superiority==, they felt that their destiny was to spread their rule around and enlighten the nations that were not so lucky. The settlers firmly believed in ==the virtue of American people and the mission to impose their virtuous ‚Äì mainly Puritan ‚Äì way of life on everybody else==. This rhetorical background served to explain the acquisition of territories or reasons to go to war, such as the war with Mexico in 1840s.\n\nOutside the United States, the effects of manifest destiny were seen in U.S. intervention in the Spanish-American war when Spain ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico and Guam to the U.S. This was an expansion of U.S. territory as colonies rather than states and was ==another demonstration of growing U.S. imperialism==.\n\nThe term of ‚ÄòManifest Destiny‚Äô first appeared in a newspaper article on the annexation of Texas in edition from July/August of the United States Magazine and Democratic Review in 1845.

Le Guin\n\n*Ed. note: just me copying and annotating this text in full, it‚Äôs that brilliant.*\n\n\u003e In the temperate and tropical regions where it appears that hominids evolved into human beings, the principal food of the species was vegetable. Sixty-five to eighty percent of what human beings ate in those regions in Paleolithic, Neolithic, and prehistoric times was gathered; only in the extreme Arctic was meat the staple food. The mammoth hunters spectacularly occupy the cave wall and the mind, ==but what we actually did to stay alive and fat was gather seeds, roots, sprouts, shoots, leaves, nuts, berries, fruits, and grains, adding bugs and mollusks and netting or snaring birds, fish, rats, rabbits, and other tuskless small fry to up the protein.== And we didn‚Äôt even work hard at it ‚Äî much less hard than peasants slaving in somebody else‚Äôs field after agriculture was invented, much less hard than paid workers since civilization was invented. The average prehistoric person could make a nice living in about a fifteen-hour work week.\n\u003e\n\u003eFifteen hours a week for subsistence leaves a lot of time for other things. So much time that maybe the restless ones who didn‚Äôt have a baby around to enliven their life, or skill in making or cooking or singing, or very interesting thoughts to think, decided to slope off and hunt mammoths. The skillful hunters would come staggering back with a load of meat, a lot of ivory, and a story. ==It wasn‚Äôt the meat that made the difference. It was the story.==\n\u003e \n\u003e It is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats.... No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.\n\u003e \n\u003eThat story not only has Action, it has a Hero. Heroes are powerful. Before you know it, the men and women in the wild-oat patch and their kids and the skills of makers and the thoughts of the thoughtful and the songs of the singers are all part of it, have all been pressed into service in the tale of the Hero. But it isn‚Äôt their story. It‚Äôs his.\n\u003e \n\u003e When she was planning the book that ended up as _Three Guineas_, ==Virginia Woolf wrote a heading in her notebook, ‚ÄúGlossary‚Äù; she had thought of reinventing English according to her new plan, in order to tell a different story. One of the entries in this glossary is _heroism_, defined as ‚Äúbotulism.‚Äù And _hero_, in Woolf‚Äôs dictionary, is ‚Äúbottle.‚Äù The hero as bottle, a stringent reevaluation. I now propose the bottle as hero.==\n\u003e \n\u003e Not just the bottle of gin or wine, but bottle in its older sense of container in general, a thing that holds something else.\n\u003e \n\u003e If you haven‚Äôt got something to put it in, food will escape you ‚Äî even something as uncombative and unresourceful as an oat. You put as many as you can into your stomach while they are handy, that being the primary container; but what about tomorrow morning when you wake up and it‚Äôs cold and raining and wouldn‚Äôt it be good to have just a few handfuls of oats to chew on and give little Oom to make her shut up, but how do you get more than one stomachful and one handful home? So you get up and go to the damned soggy oat patch in the rain, and wouldn‚Äôt it be a good thing if you had something to put Baby Oo Oo in so that you could pick the oats with both hands? A leaf a gourd shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. A recipient.\n\u003e \n\u003e \u003e *The first cultural device was probably a recipient.... Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.*\n\u003e \n\u003e So says Elizabeth Fisher in _Women‚Äôs Creation_ (McGraw-Hill, 1975). But no, this cannot be. Where is that wonderful, big, long, hard thing, a bone, I believe, that the Ape Man first bashed somebody in the movie and then, grunting with ecstasy at having achieved the first proper murder, flung up into the sky, and whirling there it became a space ship thrusting its way into the cosmos to fertilize it and produce at the end of the movie a lovely fetus, a boy of course, drifting around the Milky Way without (oddly enough) any womb, any matrix at all? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt even care. I‚Äôm not telling that story. ==We‚Äôve heard it, we‚Äôve all heard about all the sticks and spears and swords, the things to bash and poke and hit with, the long, hard things, but we have not heard about the thing to put things in, the container for the thing contained. That is a new story. That is news.==\n\u003e \n\u003e And yet old. Before ‚Äî once you think about it, surely long before ‚Äî the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger ‚Äî for what‚Äôs the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug the ones you can‚Äôt eat home in ‚Äî with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. It makes sense to me. I am an adherent of what Fisher calls the Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution.\n\u003e \n\u003e This theory not only explains large areas of theoretical obscurity and avoids large areas of theoretical nonsense (inhabited largely by tigers, foxes, and other highly territorial mammals); it also grounds me, personally, in human culture in a way I never felt grounded before. So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. ==(‚ÄúWhat Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman‚Äôs lack of _loyalty_ to civilization,‚Äù Lillian Smith observed.)== The society, the civilization they were talking about, these theoreticians, was evidently theirs; they owned it, they liked it; they were human, fully human, bashing, sticking, thrusting, killing. Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that‚Äôs what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.\n\u003e \n\u003e That‚Äôs right, they said. What you are is a woman. Possibly not human at all, certainly defective. Now be quiet while we go on telling the Story of the Ascent of Man the Hero.\n\u003e \n\u003e Go on, say I, wandering off towards the wild oats, with Oo Oo in the sling and little Oom carrying the basket. You just go on telling how the mammoth fell on Boob and how Cain fell on Abel and how the bomb fell on Nagasaki and how the burning jelly fell on the villagers and how the missiles will fall on the Evil Empire, and all the other steps in the Ascent of Man.\n\u003e\n\u003e If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it‚Äôs useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and then next day you probably do much the same again ‚Äî ==if to do that is human, if that‚Äôs what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.==\n\u003e \n\u003e Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don‚Äôt, nor does anybody else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It‚Äôs just one of those damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering wild oats and telling stories.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is the story that makes the difference. It is the story that hid my humanity from me, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. ==The killer story.==\n\u003e\n\u003e It sometimes seems that the story is approaching its end. Lest there be no more telling of stories at all, some of us out here in the wild oats, amid the alien corn, think ==we‚Äôd better start telling another one, which maybe people can go on with when the old one‚Äôs finished.== Maybe. The trouble is, we‚Äôve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story.\n\u003e \n\u003e It‚Äôs unfamiliar, it doesn‚Äôt come easily, thoughtlessly, to the lips as the killer story does; but still, ‚Äúuntold‚Äù was an exaggeration. People have been telling the life story for ages, in all sorts of words and ways. Myths of creation and transformation, trickster stories, folktales, jokes, novels....\n\u003e \n\u003e ==The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story.== Of course the Hero has frequently taken it over, that being his imperial nature and uncontrollable impulse, to take everything over and run it while making stern decrees and laws to control his uncontrollable impulse to kill it. So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting _here_ and going straight _there_ and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the story isn‚Äôt any good if he isn‚Äôt in it.\n\u003e\n\u003e I differ with all of this. I would go so far as to say that ==the natural, proper, fitting shape of the novel might be that of a sack, a bag. A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings.== A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.\n\u003e \n\u003e One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of conflict, but ==the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd.== (I have read a how-to-write manual that said, ‚ÄúA story should be seen as a battle,‚Äù and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict, competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle, may be seen as necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\u003e\n\u003e Finally, it‚Äôs clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. ==You put him in a bag and he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.==\n\u003e\n\u003e That is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.\n\u003e\n\u003e So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this great heavy sack of stuff, ==my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven nets== which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on another world, and a mouse‚Äôs skull; full of beginnings without ends, of initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and ==far more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and delusions==; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and people who don‚Äôt understand. I said it was hard to make a gripping tale of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn‚Äôt say it was impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?\n\u003e \n\u003e If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic. ‚ÄúTechnology,‚Äù or ‚Äúmodern science‚Äù (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. The fiction embodying this myth will be, and has been, triumphant (Man conquers earth, space, aliens, death, the future, etc.) and tragic (apocalypse, holocaust, then or now).\n\u003e \n\u003e If, however, one avoids the linear, progressive, Time‚Äôs-(killing)-arrow mode of the Techno-Heroic, and ==redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination==, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.\n\u003e \n\u003e It is a strange realism, but it is a strange reality.\n\u003e \n\u003e Science fiction properly conceived, like all serious fiction, however funny, is a way of trying to describe what is in fact going on, what people actually do and feel, how people relate to everything else ==in this vast sack, this belly of the universe, this womb of things to be and tomb of things that were, this unending story.== In it, as in all fiction, there is room enough to keep even Man where he belongs, in his place in the scheme of things; there is time enough to gather plenty of wild oats and sow them too, and sing to little Oom, and listen to Ool‚Äôs joke, and watch newts, and still the story isn‚Äôt over. Still there are seeds to be gathered, and room in the bag of stars.\n\n\nSource: https://otherfutures.nl/uploads/documents/le-guin-the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction.pdf","lastmodified":"2023-03-25T06:14:11.672281131Z","tags":["story"]},"/notes/concepts-of-time":{"title":"Concepts of time","content":"\nThe Greeks had two different conceptions of time: chronos (quantitative, linear) and kairos (qualitative, nonlinear). \n\nAncient Indians had a similar conception of time: kala (quantitative) and ritu (qualitative). \n\n[[notes/deep time]] (also called geological time, cosmological time, or radiological time) involves the time scale of geologic events, which is incomparably vast compared to the time scale of human history.\n\n[[notes/seasonal time]], although still somewhat linear, belongs more to the qualitative sense of time, where things are allowed to ebb and flow with their seasons instead of hewing to the abstraction of hours, minutes, or a 7-day week.","lastmodified":"2023-03-25T06:14:11.672281131Z","tags":[]},"/notes/good-ancestors":{"title":"Are we being good ancestors?","content":"\nJonas Salk, the mid-20th-century virologist, coined the question-turned-maxim, ‚ÄúAre we being good ancestors?‚Äù He called it humanity‚Äôs greatest responsibility, and said that we are not only a product of evolution, but its instruments as well.\n\n\u003e If we want to be good ancestors, we should show future generations how we coped with an age of great change and great crises. \n\u003e \n\u003e Salk, [Are We Being Good Ancestors?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45064193), 1992\n\n[[Robert Macfarlane]] says the myriad crises of the so-called and apocalyptic era of the [[notes/anthropocene]] asks this question more than ever.\n\n\u003e What is the history of things to come?

But lest we lay all the blame on the Protestants, Christianity long before then had become rooted in exploitation and violence: \n\n\u003e Hence, it was Christian for the Saxons to submit to ‚ÄúHoly Roman‚Äù imperial violence, to be crucified like Christ. The Carolingians constructed a Christian piety that used violence to convert pagans and then taught its victims to regard their violation as justified and sanctified.[^1]\n\nThis is the very same concept was perpetuated via [[Manifest Destiny]]. Once the colonies were settled, it became America‚Äôs founding myth. They had already inherited this legacy of violence, us vs. them, and either had to renounce their beliefs or perpetuate the harm. \n\n\u003e Puritan religious piety could not teach the equilibrium and equanimity needed to heal from horror, to relinquish fear, to forgive their enemies or themselves, and to repair harm. They lacked the spiritual disciplines that taught them to observe the world carefully, to trust the senses, and to wonder at the beauty of the land.[^2]\n\nThus the groundwork was laid, and all around us we see a blind, unquestioned belief in those principles. ‚ÄúJust because a myth is old doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs healthy.‚Äù[^3] [[notes/tell different stories|What can our new myths be?]]\n\n[^1]: Rebecca Ann Parker and Rita Nakashima Brock, *Saving Paradise*\n[^2]: *ibid*\n[^3]: Sophie Strand, *The Flowering Wand*","lastmodified":"2023-03-25T06:14:11.676281342Z","tags":["belief systems"]},"/notes/who-is-more-deserving":{"title":"Who is more deserving","content":"\n\u003e As if deserving meant anything. As if one could earn beauty, or life! \n\u003e \n\u003e *(The Dispossessed, Ursula K. Le Guin)*\n\nOver on Sluggish, Jesse Meadows is talking about people getting ruffled ‚Äú[because everyone online is autistic now](https://sluggish.substack.com/p/why-is-everyone-online-autistic-now).‚Äù It‚Äôs just the latest hand-wringing over autism as an internet trend (or insert any ‚Äú-ism as an internet trend‚Äù), and the key argument is that the right people aren‚Äôt getting what they deserve, while ‚Äúfakers‚Äù are taking resources away.\n\n\u003e And there‚Äôs that word, the one that crops up all the time in a world defined by scarcity.\n\nDeserve. Some deserve, some don‚Äôt. What could be common ground becomes a fight for resources, rejecting people with varying levels of need because of the belief that there isn‚Äôt enough to go around.\n\nbell hooks calls it ‚Äú[[the capitalist notion of well-being]],‚Äù the belief that the good life can only be had by a few. Meadows cites the book *Health Communism*, tracing the deserving/non-deserving binary back to the early days of [[English Poor Laws]], which had to source the ‚Äúsurplus population‚Äù (look at that language already) into increasingly marginal, verifiable categories. Some citizens were ‚Äúdeserving,‚Äù while others were treated as waste, a strain on the productive (taxpaying) community who were the *real* sovereign citizens.\n\n\u003e The worker is told to beware of the degenerate influence of the surplus population and to root out those who would fraudulently claim state or private benefits as surplus; ==we are deputized by the state to surveil and judge others‚Äô worthiness for aid.== *(Health Communism)*\n\n(Note: big overlap with religion too! Hence the [[theology of capitalism]].)\n\nWhat can we do? Stop believing [[notes/myth of scarcity]]. Reject this limited, binary framing. Recognize our solidarity.
