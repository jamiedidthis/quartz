This is the book I knew she had in her. It’s just as brilliant and damning a portrait of a toxic marriage as <em><a href=/books/liars rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/liars>Liars</a></em> was, with the added generational trauma and displacement of a Palestinian family. Those are the parts that brought tears to my eyes, the glimpses of the nakba and the camps, the unspeakable loss, the traditions and meals Yara preserves even in the mountains of North Carolina. It does one another beautiful thing that <em>Liars</em> doesn’t do, too—it’s not so insular, it’s ultimately friendship and connection that break the spell of isolation and grief and help Yara find her way out. It’s a love story in the end, between a mother and her daughters, between two best friends, between a woman and herself.</p><hr><a href=#bookslessons-from-cruisinglessons-from-cruising--authorsmartin-goodmanmartin-goodman-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=bookslessons-from-cruisinglessons-from-cruising--authorsmartin-goodmanmartin-goodman-2024><em><a href=/books/lessons-from-cruising rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/lessons-from-cruising>Lessons from Cruising</a></em> — <a href=/authors/martin-goodman rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/martin-goodman>Martin Goodman</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>Joke’s on me, because I picked up this ARC for the last story, a retelling of <em>Billy Budd</em> from Captain Vere’s point of view. I figured I’d sample the rest; instead I went down the buffet line and inhaled them all. Rarely do I like <em>every</em> story in a short story collection, but that’s what Goodman’s done to me. The cover and title are not helping the book find its audience, as indicated by the low ratings and confused reviews on Goodreads. I expected stoic litfic <em>a la</em> Garth Greenwell; instead there’s surrealism, hilarity, dream states, spec fic and fantasy, myth retellings, and my favorite: the disillusioned Anglican vicar Alan, writing letters from Tarsus and Antioch, heretically following the footsteps of St. Thekla and St. Paul. The writing buzzes with life, surreal, queer in every sense of the word, delightful.</p><hr><a href=#booksa-sorceress-comes-to-calla-sorceress-comes-to-call--authorst-kingfishert-kingfisher-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=booksa-sorceress-comes-to-calla-sorceress-comes-to-call--authorst-kingfishert-kingfisher-2024><em><a href=/books/a-sorceress-comes-to-call rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/a-sorceress-comes-to-call>A Sorceress Comes to Call</a></em> — <a href=/authors/t-kingfisher rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/t-kingfisher>T. Kingfisher</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>I’m here all day long for T. Kingfisher’s aging, aching protagonists, with bad knees and big hearts and a well-honed sense of doom. The plot is a very loose retelling of The Goose Girl, minus princesses and kings and plus a conniving, murderous, sorceress mother. Evangeline, aka Doom, is determined to marry herself and her trapped, obedient daughter to the highest bidders in proper Regency-esque fashion, plans thwarted when she encounters a squire’s spinster sister who sees her for exactly who she is. There’s a coterie of women to the rescue: the no-nonsense Hester, the ruthless Imogene, the enchanting Penelope, and eventually Doom’s daughter Cordelia herself.</p><p>It’s not rah-rah feminism so much as it is changing the terms for who we deem worthy of consideration, agency, and power in these stories. In T. Kingfisher fashion, that includes the animal world as well. I’d happily read a whole series of Hester, her geese, and her friends (including Richard) living their best life and thwarting monsters in whatever form they take.</p><hr><a href=#bookshot-earl-summerhot-earl-summer--authorserica-ridleyerica-ridley-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=bookshot-earl-summerhot-earl-summer--authorserica-ridleyerica-ridley-2024><em><a href=/books/hot-earl-summer rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/hot-earl-summer>Hot Earl Summer</a></em> — <a href=/authors/erica-ridley rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/erica-ridley>Erica Ridley</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>A goofy, over-the-top farce with the volume dialed up to 11. Which seems <em>absurd</em> to complain about, given how I just read and loved <em><a href=/books/something-extraordinary rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/something-extraordinary>Something Extraordinary</a></em>—surely if anything is dialed up to 11 it’s the Tarletons. But Alexis Hall grounds his farce with deep emotion and intimacy, using it to scratch away at the actual farce of a society that dictates such rigid, preposterous roles. I feel Erica Ridley wanting to do something similar, but it stays at the superficial level, with ripped abs and lust at first sight and a relationship that’s just as conventional as you please, apart from a heroine with a sword. I applaud the found family and the chronic disability rep, but without deeper character work, this veers into cartoonish and (she winces) boring territory for me.</p><hr><a href=#booksthe-palace-of-erosthe-palace-of-eros--authorscaro-de-robertiscaro-de-robertis-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=booksthe-palace-of-erosthe-palace-of-eros--authorscaro-de-robertiscaro-de-robertis-2024><em><a href=/books/the-palace-of-eros rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/the-palace-of-eros>The Palace of Eros</a></em> — <a href=/authors/caro-de-robertis rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/caro-de-robertis>Caro De Robertis</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>My adjectives for the prose: purple, dense, florid, bloated. It sounds like I’m describing a corpse. DNF @ 15% because none of it is connecting with me, not the first-person Psyche nor the third-person Eros, nor the prose that’s turgid to the point of hyperbole. (Did I just want the chance to deploy the word turgid? Maaaaaybe. It’s such a good word.)</p><hr><a href=#booksthe-emperor-and-the-endless-palacethe-emperor-and-the-endless-palace--authorsjustinian-huangjustinian-huang-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=booksthe-emperor-and-the-endless-palacethe-emperor-and-the-endless-palace--authorsjustinian-huangjustinian-huang-2024><em><a href=/books/the-emperor-and-the-endless-palace rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/the-emperor-and-the-endless-palace>The Emperor and the Endless Palace</a></em> — <a href=/authors/justinian-huang rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/justinian-huang>Justinian Huang</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>I kept my expectations low, and the writing shows promise on the sentence level—but on the plot/structure/worldbuilding/thematic level, it falls apart. There are plot twists that change the entire point of the story, but Huang doesn’t write like he knows that. (If there’s a second book, perhaps he plans to explore that further, but it doesn’t come together in this book.) Bummer, because a queer AF update of two queer AF ancient Chinese stories—one of which gives us the origin of the term cut-sleeve—is such a great concept, and one I really want to read.</p><hr><a href=#booksficcionesficciones--authorsjorge-luis-borgesjorge-luis-borges-1994 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=booksficcionesficciones--authorsjorge-luis-borgesjorge-luis-borges-1994><em><a href=/books/ficciones rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/ficciones>Ficciones</a></em> — <a href=/authors/jorge-luis-borges rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/jorge-luis-borges>Jorge Luis Borges</a> (1994)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>Borges is up to some delightful fuckery, playing with form, inventing books and authors and universes that are just as, to paraphrase, contaminated with fiction as our own history of the world. The stories are brief and vertiginous, mind-boggling and often cheeky. An undisputed masterpiece, even if I’m still partial to <a href=/authors/italo-calvino rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/italo-calvino>Calvino</a>, even if Calvino himself would disagree with me (per his essay on Borges in <em><a href=/books/six-memos-for-the-next-millennium rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/six-memos-for-the-next-millennium>Six Memos for the Next Millennium</a></em>).</p><hr><a href=#bookshow-to-fall-for-a-scoundrelhow-to-fall-for-a-scoundrel--authorskate-batemankate-bateman-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=bookshow-to-fall-for-a-scoundrelhow-to-fall-for-a-scoundrel--authorskate-batemankate-bateman-2024><em><a href=/books/how-to-fall-for-a-scoundrel rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/how-to-fall-for-a-scoundrel>How to Fall for a Scoundrel</a></em> — <a href=/authors/kate-bateman rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/kate-bateman>Kate Bateman</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>A thief and a private investigator team up to solve a theft, and the vibes are basically a case-of-the-week tv episode (think <em>Charlie’s Angels</em>, <em>Remington Steele</em>, <em>White Collar</em>, etc) playing historical dress-up. The plot is as straightforward as it gets—they search for a
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin rel=noopener>macguffin</a>, they get a clue, they get another clue, they solve the case. No twisty characters or <a href=/authors/kj-charles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/kj-charles>KJ Charles</a>-level plotting here. I was all set to breeze through it and enjoy myself regardless, and then a bad case of instalove reared its head, along with ye olde hardcore gender essentialism, the kind that bums me out and turns me off. For example, a memorable scene where Harry has to dress like a dandy for an undercover recon (an <em>Italian</em> dandy, at that), and the author takes great pains to assure us that, “On any other man, the ensemble would have looked ridiculous, almost feminine, but on <em>him</em> the flamboyant clothes only served to accentuate his intense masculinity.”</p><p>Sigh. That’s on me for reading outside my lane, but my hope for a quick, fun read with heists and spies didn’t pan out.</p><hr><a href=#booksill-have-what-hes-havingill-have-what-hes-having--authorsadib-khorramadib-khorram-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=booksill-have-what-hes-havingill-have-what-hes-having--authorsadib-khorramadib-khorram-2024><em><a href=/books/ill-have-what-hes-having rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/ill-have-what-hes-having>I’ll Have What He’s Having</a></em> — <a href=/authors/adib-khorram rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/adib-khorram>Adib Khorram</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>I’m glad the term

David Curtis, sommelier, mistakes Farzan Alavi for a food critic, and what blooms in the wake of this mixup is a tender, sexy, heartfelt romance between two grown adults who have to deal with the obstacles that a grown-ass relationship entails. Highlights include both of their friend groups, and coworkers, and families, jokes and mishaps during sex (!), the love letter to Kansas City (flaws included), and the rich Iranian culture, community, and cuisine of the Alavi family restaurant (my stomach growls).</p><p>Beautifully done, every bit of it—especially the miscommunication, which is the opposite of contrived and sparks growth and better communication. Favorite romance I’ve read this month, and on track to be one of the best-of for the year.</p><hr><a href=#bookscome-out-come-outcome-out-come-out--authorsnatalie-c-parkernatalie-c-parker-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=bookscome-out-come-outcome-out-come-out--authorsnatalie-c-parkernatalie-c-parker-2024><em><a href=/books/come-out-come-out rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/come-out-come-out>Come Out, Come Out</a></em> — <a href=/authors/natalie-c-parker rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/natalie-c-parker>Natalie C.

Similarities abound, even down to the senior class quarry jumps, which doesn’t indicate any co-opting of plot points but simply how ubiquitous this experience is, the same script across rural America, where any deviation from the script means there will be Consequences. A key plot point involves a gender-swapped/gender-neutral production of <em>Grease</em>, which is both fun and thematically relevant. Chuck Tingle nails the horror bits more effectively, but Parker nails the family/friends emotional dynamics very well. I’m glad that both exist.</p><hr><a href=#booksa-governesss-guide-to-passion-and-perila-governesss-guide-to-passion-and-peril--authorsmanda-collinsmanda-collins-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=booksa-governesss-guide-to-passion-and-perila-governesss-guide-to-passion-and-peril--authorsmanda-collinsmanda-collins-2024><em><a href=/books/a-governesss-guide-to-passion-and-peril rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/a-governesss-guide-to-passion-and-peril>A Governess’s Guide to Passion and Peril</a></em> — <a href=/authors/manda-collins rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/manda-collins>Manda Collins</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>The fourth in a series, and I read at least one of the first three during the fugue state years when my dad’s health was failing, so I have only the haziest memory of it. That might mean I’m missing something, as it never felt explained in the text why the other women hadn’t come to Jane’s aid before now, nor why Jane’s feelings for Adrian would evolve beyond a schoolgirl crush. The plot is sketched out, not fleshed out—the side characters are props, the culprit is telegraphed from his first appearance on page, both the mystery and the romance are a series of scenes that happen without much tension or suspense, and the climax is <a href=/notes/on-firearms-trust-and-historical-accuracy rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/on-firearms-trust-and-historical-accuracy>sloppy to a fault</a>. One thing that bothers me in romance is when it’s taken for granted that the couple belongs together: i.e. they’re young, attractive, and available, so poof, they’re in love. As opposed to being drawn toward someone against expectation or reason, and all the complexity and growth that entails. It manifests a lot more often in straight romance than queer romance, for obvious reasons, which is why these m/f historicals keep failing me, even when I’m just in the mood for fluffy distraction.</p><hr><a href=#bookswe-the-gathered-heatwe-the-gathered-heat-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-poetry-performance-and-spoken-word--edited-by-authorsfranny-choifranny-choi-authorsbao-phibao-phi-authorsnoʻu-revillanoʻu-revilla-and-authorsterisa-siagatonuterisa-siagatonu-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=bookswe-the-gathered-heatwe-the-gathered-heat-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-poetry-performance-and-spoken-word--edited-by-authorsfranny-choifranny-choi-authorsbao-phibao-phi-authorsnoʻu-revillanoʻu-revilla-and-authorsterisa-siagatonuterisa-siagatonu-2024><em><a href=/books/we-the-gathered-heat rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/we-the-gathered-heat>We the Gathered Heat: Asian American and Pacific Islander Poetry, Performance, and Spoken Word</a></em> — edited by <a href=/authors/franny-choi rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/franny-choi>Franny Choi</a>, <a href=/authors/bao-phi rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/bao-phi>Bao Phi</a>, <a href=/authors/no%CA%BBu-revilla rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/no%CA%BBu-revilla>Noʻu Revilla</a>, and <a href=/authors/terisa-siagatonu rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/terisa-siagatonu>Terisa Siagatonu</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>Superb. This is how to do an anthology, where the disparate voices are the point—how do we even define AAPI except as “the other,” non-white? Who is the “we” in question? To whom is that category useful? The poems are sorted into themes of “mourn,” “pronounce,” “fight,” “love,” each as powerful as the last. A cacophony, a mosaic, a sum that is more than the whole of its parts. As the subtitle indicates, it leans heavily on the oral tradition, and I would love to hear these pieces performed out loud.</p><hr><a href=#booksone-day-ill-grow-up-and-be-a-beautiful-womanone-day-ill-grow-up-and-be-a-beautiful-woman--authorsabi-maxwellabi-maxwell-2024 class=hanchor-text><h4 id=booksone-day-ill-grow-up-and-be-a-beautiful-womanone-day-ill-grow-up-and-be-a-beautiful-woman--authorsabi-maxwellabi-maxwell-2024><em><a href=/books/one-day-ill-grow-up-and-be-a-beautiful-woman rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/books/one-day-ill-grow-up-and-be-a-beautiful-woman>One Day I’ll Grow Up and Be a Beautiful Woman</a></em> — <a href=/authors/abi-maxwell rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/authors/abi-maxwell>Abi Maxwell</a> (2024)<span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor> &#9901;</span></h4></a><p>Nonfiction memoir about a mother raising her autistic, transgender daughter and the New Hampshire town that puts their family through hell. A harrowing and heartbreaking survival guide (barely? hopefully?) about weathering the eye of the current political storm. I’m always looking for books I can recommend to well-meaning people who want to see past the transphobic headlines, and this one goes on the list. (Well-meaning people, as opposed to those who want to remain comfortably safe in their bigotry. Indeed, one of the most frustrating, infuriating parts of Maxwell’s story are those who just want to seem <em>nice</em> at all costs, so they can feel like good people, regardless of the consequences of either their hateful actions or their silence.)</p><p>Trans rights are human rights, and to learn more or take action, I can personally vouch that
