Creepy and exquisite, and that’s not just the cover art.
(With a bonus Beatrix Potter relative, clever worldbuilding linguistics w/r/t gender, and a hat tip to Prisoner of Zenda!</description></item><item><title>Iron &amp; Velvet</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/iron-and-velvet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/iron-and-velvet/</guid><description>I have now done each of these in print (well, ebook, as print is sadly out of print) and each of these in audio, and all other vampire books can check themselves at the door.

This is one of the above.

(Read them out of order, oops!) Lots of promise, but I think the difference in POV—floating omniscient instead of tight third—didn’t work quite as well for me, possibly because it’s such a high bar of difficulty, possibly because it’s much closer to Jane Austen’s voice, which means the differences in quality are glaring.</description></item><item><title>A Wizard of Earthsea</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-wizard-of-earthsea/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:43:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-wizard-of-earthsea/</guid><description>This felt like something between prologue and parable, and yet I’m still into it.

ALMOST. Everybody has arcs and character growth, even the exes; everybody contributes their piece of misunderstanding and conflict resolution to the plot.

Masterful use of dialect and structure to deconstruct the traditional bounds of genre and narrative.

There were some structure/plot/writing choices that left me more stumped than dazzled.

Kingfisher’s aging, aching protagonists, with bad knees and big hearts and a well-honed sense of doom. The plot is a very loose retelling of The Goose Girl, minus princesses and kings and plus a conniving, murderous, sorceress mother. Evangeline, aka Doom, is determined to marry herself and her trapped, obedient daughter to the highest bidders in proper Regency-esque fashion, plans thwarted when she encounters a squire’s spinster sister who sees her for exactly who she is.</description></item><item><title>Clocktaur Wars</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/series/clocktaur-wars/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 15:14:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/series/clocktaur-wars/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gina Rippon</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/authors/gina-rippon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 15:14:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/authors/gina-rippon/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Minor Mage</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/minor-mage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 15:14:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/minor-mage/</guid><description>Oliver was already on his knees, but he bowed his head, feeling complicated things he didn’t know how to deal with.

Robert Lowth, who wrote a widely used English grammar in 1792, passed an aesthetic judgment on the sentence-ending preposition (it wasn’t Latin-y enough), and later grammarians elevated this preference to a full-on ban.</description></item><item><title>Taoism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/taoism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 14:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/taoism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Rhizomatic thinking</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/rhizomatic-thinking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 14:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/notes/rhizomatic-thinking/</guid><description>Rhizome, from the ancient Greek: a mass of roots.
