<p class="indextitle">I read <a href="/books" class="internal-link">books</a>, I write <a href="/notes" class="internal-link">notes</a>, and here is where I collect and cross-pollinate the ideas.</p>

This is a peek behind the scenes, my raw notes where I think out loud. Part scratch pad, part library, part second brain, it’s a repository of whatever captures my imagination at the moment, changing and growing as I do.

You can start with what’s recent (below), or search for what strikes your fancy. It’s a choose-your-own-adventure, so there’s no wrong place to start.
