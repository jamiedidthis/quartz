<p class="indextitle">I read <a href="/books/" class="internal-link">books</a>, I write <a href="/notes/" class="internal-link">notes</a>, and here is where I collect and cross-pollinate the ideas.</p>

Hi! I’m [[info|Jamie]], and this is part scratchpad, part library, part second brain, a repository of whatever I’m reading or learning at the moment, evolving as I do.

I think in [[notes/bottom-up processing|nonlinear fashion]], so the content is more of [[notes/rhizomatic thinking|a web of connections]] than a chronological blog. Choose your own adventure—there’s no wrong place to start.
