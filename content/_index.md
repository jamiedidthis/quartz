Hi! I’m [[about|Jamie]], and this is part scratchpad, part library, part second brain, a repository of whatever I’m reading or learning at the moment, evolving as I do.

I don’t think in linear fashion, so the content is more of an interconnected web than a chronological blog. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure—there’s no wrong place to start.
