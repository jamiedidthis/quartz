> <span class="epigraph">—Lao Tzu (translation by Ursula K. Le Guin)</span>

Lan Wangji knows a moment of scalding shock, as disorienting as a teacup suddenly spilled in his lap.

It’s happened more than once, this week. At least he is not alone with it this time. Lan Qiren is furious, unable to outfox the brash young cultivator standing in the middle of the class, who is giving eloquent, textbook answers to every question, answering so swiftly and humbly that it almost feels like a mockery, like he could yawn his way through it the way he has most of the morning, idly doodling and dozing, except for the fact that something interesting is finally happening and he’s going to enjoy the moment the way he would unwrap a sweet.

Lan Wangji is there for appearances. He is supposed to sit straight-backed and disciplined, the perfect model of a student, the shining pinnacle of everything the Lan have to offer. *He* is supposed to swiftly and humbly recite the correct answer when a student falters like an untutored novice. *He* is not supposed to feel his heart race, his fingers curling in his sleeves, outdone by a careless, lazy flirt who aims his smile at Lan Wangji as precisely as an arrow, treating scholarly, serious subjects like a practice game of swords. 

*Wei Wuxian.* The name is made for clenched teeth, for outbursts of frustration. He must have been old enough to be like… *this,* already, when he was given the name. 

Lan Wangji feels scant satisfaction when Lan Qiren does have to call on him. Scanter satisfaction still when the room erupts in shouts like someone kicked a hive of bees. Lan Qiren throws his scroll. Wei Wuxian expertly ducks. By then it’s all just one long buzz in Lan Wangji’s head, *improper cultivation, redirection not suppression,* Lan Wangji already bowing when Lan Qiren orders him to the library to administer Wei Wuxian’s punishment. 

It’s what he had asked for the first night, hauling Wei Wuxian in and tossing him down on the carpet in front of the two elder Lan. Punishment, principles, they were all in place for a reason. They were not to be scoffed at, eyes going wide as the moon at the sheer number of them, brushed like dust off his long sleeves. 

They will be written, at length, in detail, line by line, by the thousands, until Wei Wuxian’s hand is so crabbed he cannot ink a brush, willpower so broken that he will only ever speak politely when spoken to, the fire of his spirit so quenched that the grin falls off his face. It’s this image Lan Wangji cherishes, mentally painting it brushstroke by brushstroke, rendering it in loving detail as he hauls Wei Wuxian from a waterfall and plants him in the library. 

It can take all summer, if it needs to. 

Wei Wuxian will *learn.* 

---- 

Wei Wuxian does not learn. 

Lan Wangji, diligent in all of his duties, reports on his progress to Lan Xichen, and occasionally to their uncle himself, at the end of each week. A dozen copies transcribed. Five dozen. A hundred. “One hundred and forty-three,” he says this evening. Strictly speaking, it is one hundred and forty-two and a half, because he crumpled up the final pages and told Wei Wuxian to do them over when he had inked most of the margins with stick figures kissing. But Lan Wangji is generous. He *will* make Wei Wuxian finish those pages; he will also finesse that number slightly to his brother for the sake of expedience.

*Do not be needlessly pedantic,* principle one-eighty-five. 

It is only his brother he reports to tonight, who looks over the pages Lan Wangji has brought him (sans stick figures kissing), and remarks, “His calligraphy is not improving.”

“Mn,” Lan Wangji says. 

Lan Xichen suppresses a small smile. “Unlike his behavior in class. He has not caused a disruption in over a week. We have you to thank, Wangji.”

Lan Wangji purses his lips. They do. They have him to thank, because *now,* Wei Wuxian vibrates through class with all of his pent-up questions, unleashing the torrent on Lan Wangji as soon as they escape to the library, like a river flooding its banks. *Now,* Wei Wuxian directs a significant portion of his energy to the study and torment of Lan Wangji, fixating upon him like a particularly interesting specimen that he will pick apart with his fingers and consume piece by piece.

*Do not be ungracious,* principle sixty-six. 

“—know it’s been a trial for you,” Lan Xichen is saying. “You’ve done well, but I will have a word with Uncle. There is no reason one of the outer disciples cannot watch over him instead.”

Lan Wangji feels a pulse of alarm. An *outer disciple,* in Wei Wuxian’s hands. “No,” he says sharply.

“No?” 

Lan Wangji lowers his gaze in respect. It lands on the sheaf of pages Lan Xichen holds, all the columns inked crookedly.[^1] “It would not…” He falters.

“…be wise?” Lan Xichen finishes. “Ah. I suppose not. You are right. Still, you have better things to do with your time. You are gracious, Wangji.” 

No. No, he is not. He is… irresponsible, and incautious, and he doesn’t know why it feels like he told a lie when he did not. The vast pit of unease that sits in his stomach and has not dissipated in weeks roils away in confusion. He has *done nothing wrong,* and yet it feels like Lan Qiren could level his sternest gaze and dictate his harshest punishment, and Lan Wangji would deserve it. Wei Wuxian has *done everything wrong,* and he breezes through his days, beams with delight when he’s scolded, naps like a cat in the sunlight, without a trace of guilty conscience. 

*Do good, and goodness follows*—principle twenty-eight.

Something is profoundly disordered. Lan Wangji is still sorting out *what* when he walks home at dusk, taking the long way around to do some sitting by the waterfall. He is so lost in thought that he almost stumbles, halting abruptly when he spots someone there first. 

Wei Wuxian is sprawled on the rock, deeply engrossed in a book. *Outside of class*—a book. Reading. Lan Wangji has to rearrange the mental disarray this causes, more things not in their right place. Probably, it is—no, he can’t think of something unkind to charge him with. A book is a book—always good.[^2] Exactly which text it is, Lan Wangji can’t see, only that it’s not one of their textbooks. He glimpses an illustration.

His feet move of their own accord, drawing him over. Wei Wuxian jumps a mile, dropping the book and then scrambling after it. He sits upright, suddenly exhibiting the perfect posture that he has heretofore lacked, placing the book in his lap, folding his arms over it, offering Lan Wangji his most virtuous grin.

“Lan Zhan!” he says brightly.

Lan Wangji reaches down for the book.

Wei Wuxian, bright red, yelps and slaps him away. He quickly sticks the book underneath him, sitting on it, pulling his skirts taut over his knees. 

“Do not treat a book that way,” Lan Wangji says ferociously.

“Ha! Can if I want to. It’s mine, Lan Zhan.”

“Yours.” 

“*Mine,*” he repeats. He looks around them, shifting his attention placidly onto the view. “So pretty here, Lan Zhan. Do you ever swim in the water? Bet it’s freezing. Bet there’s a rule.” He makes a face, dropping his voice into what is probably meant to be an imitation of Lan Qiren. “*Swimming is prohibited in Cloud Recesses.*” 

Wei Wuxian knows there is no such rule—he would have copied it a hundred and forty-three times if there was. But, Lan Wangji concedes—there is only no rule because such a rule has not been necessary. Gusu Lan disciples do not grow up swimming like fish.

“I don’t swim,” Lan Wangji says.

Wei Wuxian looks up, aghast. “Don’t, or *can’t?* How can you not swim, Lan Zhan? Did you just never learn? In Yunmeng we learn to swim before we can walk. I would’ve drowned if I couldn’t, all the times Jiang Cheng’s thrown me in the river.”

Lan Wangji, in this instance, can commiserate with Jiang Wanyin. “What did you do to deserve it?”

“Ha! Ha-ha-ha. Lan Zhan, you’re so funny. Something bad happened to me, so of course I deserved it.” He is shaking his head. “I’d throw *you* in a river, Lan Zhan. Just for fun.”

It has happened again. Lan Wangji has been drawn into a conversation he had no intention of having. He has also been neatly sidetracked from the book—which he did not care about in the first place. He does the mental equivalent of rubbing his forehead, right where the pain throbs in his temple. 

Wei Wuxian tidies his skirts, tucking them around his ankles, looking for all the world like he won’t move for the rest of the night. It reminds Lan Wangji of his purpose, the sitting and meditating he would like to be doing. “Curfew,” he says.

“Curfew?” Wei Wuxian echoes, looking up at the sky that is still light against the mountain.

“You are breaking it.” 

“Not yet.” 

Lan Wangji’s fingers clench reflexively around Bichen.

“It’s not dark yet, Lan Zhan. Anyone can see it’s not dark. Curfew is nightfall.”

“It will be nightfall,” Lan Wangji points out pedantically, mentally apologizing for rule one-eighty-five, “by the time you reach your rooms.” 

Wei Wuxian sulks. Then he goes still, tipping his head like he’s sighting a bird in a bush.

“Bribery is prohibited,” Lan Wangji preempts him.

“No, no no,” Wei Wuxian says, lost in thought. “It’s just that—Lan Zhan. That would mean *you’re* breaking curfew.” He taps his nose thoughtfully. “Why would the beautiful Second Young Master Lan be risking his spotless reputation to sneak off after curfew? Lan Zhan!” His eyes widen. He affects a conspiratorial grin of delight. “Do you have a… secret lover?”

“Wei *Ying.*”

“I know, I know, I know, I know. Secret. Is she pretty, Lan Zhan? Or… he?” Wei Wuxian frowns thoughtfully. “I’m trying to picture you kissing someone, Lan Zhan. Who would make you like them *that way?”* He makes a face over the failure of imagination he is apparently experiencing. 

Lan Wangji is just standing there, breathing sharply.

“I can’t picture it. Lan Zhan is so pretty. Who would be good enough for him? They would have to be noble of bearing, and pleasing in virtue, and the most beautiful cultivator in the land…” He shakes his head woefully, then brightens. “Maybe they will come soon, and I will see for myself!”

Lan Wangji actually—*actually*—makes a guttural sound of frustration. He has not done that since childhood.

“I know, I know,” Wei Wuxian says again. He tilts his head at Lan Wangji in pained sympathy. “You are worried I will tell on you since you told on me. But I am not that kind of person, Lan Zhan.” He is devious, utterly devious, because he makes his dark eyes look genuinely wide with distress. “Are you worried, Lan Zhan? Would they punish you, for love? Are you going to have to write Conduct and Virtue one thousand times?”

“Wei Ying,” he says, with deadly calm. 

“Lan Zhan, do not worry. I, your faithful friend Wei Ying, will stand by you to the end.” He lifts three fingers to his brow, which he holds for a moment before he splutters and tries to be solemn, but can’t and breaks into laughter. “Lan Zhan, the look on your face. I should paint it. I’d need lots of red ink—Lan Zhan!”

Lan Wangji, with dignity, has turned to walk away. He keeps walking. Not caring. Let him break curfew. Let him break so many rules he has to do penance on his knees. Tie him down to a desk, see if he obeys then, hobble his ankles, put a silence spell on that mouth—

Another guttural sound, no one to hear but the trees.

----

Lan Wangji does not like being toyed with. For a week he makes Wei Wuxian suffer through his impassive silence. He doesn’t glare, nor does he sulk, nor does he pointedly direct his righteous fury that way. He simply goes about his business as though Wei Wuxian does not exist, even during their afternoons in the library. 

It is more effective than anything Lan Wangji has done all summer. Wei Wuxian suffers. He teases, he dawdles, he does everything he can think of that should earn him a scolding. Lan Wangji reads, unaffected, or transcribes his own perfect texts, paying attention only to the brush and his sleeves. Wei Wuxian acts like it’s agony, like no one has ever been so cruel to him as this. There is a lot of showy drama. After several days, he seems truly distressed, even apologizing in a roundabout way where he doesn’t directly admit fault, bringing Lan Wangji offerings, mostly fruit, which Lan Wangji doesn’t touch, letting it attract flies.

It is late afternoon, a gray day with rain pattering lightly on the roof, when the impasse finally ends. Wei Wuxian is attempting his own silent treatment, and is actually copying lines; Lan Wangji is deeply absorbed in a poem by Li Bai.[^3] There is a line of such beauty—*peach blossoms flow downstream*—that Lan Wangji looks up to absorb it, the way he would if he was alone in his room. His eyes land on Wei Wuxian as if they wanted to rest there in the first place, and Wei Wuxian, mid-brush stroke, lifts his gaze. 

The moment snags the way a petal would, caught in the eddy of a stream. Wei Wuxian looks at him, and then slowly, like the first pink of dawn spreading across the pearly gray sky, he smiles. A quiet, soft smile of irrepressible loveliness, followed by a slow, happy blink that says, *thank you, and sorry.* That says, *ah, there you are, you finally see me again.*

----

It is the white robe, through the trees, that pulls Lan Wangji off the path. He does not know how he knows it’s Wei Wuxian—he just does. It is not where it should be, for one; for another, there is talking. The words grow distinct as Lan Wangji draws closer—they’re such nice bees, he’s saying, nice bees who wouldn’t want to ever sting anybody, especially anybody like him, who’s so nice too, and their friend, and just wants to taste some of this delicious honey they’ve made, the most delicious in the world. 

“A-Xian!” 

A bright, girlish laugh stops Lan Wangji’s heart. There is someone else with him, a second robe fluttering, which had been just out of sight. She stands on the ground; Wei Wuxian teeters above her, atop a large boulder, up to his elbows in the hollow trunk of a tree. 

“Careful! Here, take it,” Wei Wuxian calls out, crouching to pass her something with both hands.[^4]

He is clouded in—bees. Everywhere, bees. The girl below him, undaunted by the swarm, shows no fear for him, or for herself. 

“Shijie!” he scolds her. “Don’t drop it,” and Lan Wangji recognizes the purple sash and ribbons of Wei Wuxian’s sister. 

“We shouldn’t be here,” she’s saying, which matches, with relief, the assessment Lan Wangji had made of her character: polite and conscientious, immune to mischief, soft-spoken and well-mannered, someone who could not be more unrelated to Wei Wuxian. 

Except here she is, working in easy tandem, used to such things. Taking honeycombs from him, and placing them in a basket hanging over her arm. 

“I asked Lan Zhan,” Wei Wuxian is saying. “It’s fine. He said so. Shijie, how much do you want?”

Lan Wangji does not clear his throat, nor does he speak. He merely places himself in the middle of the clearing and waits for the thieving pair to notice. It is satisfying when they do. Jiang Yanli startles, by the base of the tree, quickly saying, “Second Young Master Lan,” and dropping into a bow around the basket.

Wei Wuxian has the decency to turn pink. 

He is where Lan Wangji places his steady gaze, since he is no doubt the instigator. Jiang Yanli is saying something about how gracious Second Young Master Lan is, to understand their request and grant them this privilege. 

“Mn,” Lan Wangji says, inclining his head slightly, since going along with the blatant lie is making Wei Wuxian squirm. 

“See! Shijie,” he says, laughing nervously, recovering his footing, literally and figuratively. “I told you Lan Zhan was kind, and not boring at all, and not the type of person who would be mean and not share nice things with his friends.” He is pressing his luck, watching to see how far Lan Wangji will go with him as he plays out this rope. 

Lan Wangji is curious about that himself. “Mn,” he says again. 

There is more to the chorus from Jiang Yanli, how thankful she is, how the Lan clan is so hospitable, how already she feels better and wishes to know if—

“A-Jie!” A shout interrupts them from the foot of the hill. 

“Ah, that’s a-Cheng,” she says, throwing a look at Wei Wuxian. She looks pained, torn between loyalty, politeness, and duty. Fortunately, for Lan Wangji, these obligations are in harmony. “I don’t wish to rush off, but he will… if you’ll excuse me,” she says. Demurely, she bows to Lan Wangji again, holding it an extra moment of courtesy. “A-Xian…” She trades a communicative glance with her brother, then skirts politely around Lan Wangji, a safe distance away before she calls out, “A-Cheng, I’m here! We found it,” picking her way through the trees. 

Wei Wuxian, still on the boulder, waits for her to go before he spreads his arms, swoops down across the short distance, and lands face to face with Lan Wangji. A few bees fly with him, circling them both, until they find nothing of interest and desultorily return to the swarm in the tree. 

“Stealing,” Lan Wangji says, refusing to take a step backwards to keep proper distance between them.

“Not stealing.” Wei Wuxian holds up two bare forearms, sleeves rolled up past his elbows. He shows Lan Wangji, front and back. A few scratches have raised faint little dotted ribbons of blood to the surface of his skin. No stings. “I asked nicely. The nice bees said yes. Didn’t hurt me. And it’s *their* honey, not yours.”

“Lying.” Lan Wangji continues his list. 

“Only so shijie wouldn’t feel bad. And I *did* try to find you! Not my fault you hide from me all the time.” Another lie, and a glimmer of pleasure in telling it. Wei Wuxian’s eyes are warm brown at this distance, like rosewood polished to a gleam. 

Lan Wangji holds his gaze. “Indecent attire.”

“Fine, fine fine,” Wei Wuxian says, finally hearing a crime he’ll admit to. He flaps his arms in a shrug. “Bare skin! It’s so scandalous. Lan Zhan will maul me before we’re even out of the forest! My virtue will never recover.” He reaches to untie his sleeves and realizes his hands are sticky with honey, and tree bark, and a good deal of dirt. He shrugs again, dropping his arms sheepishly. 

Lan Wangji makes a calculation. He turns and starts walking. 

“Lan Zhan—what the—” Wei Wuxian huffs. Lan Wangji does not look back. He knows the way through the trees; when he stops, Wei Wuxian has trailed after him warily, and stops too, a short distance away. 

Lan Wangji waits for him to see it. When he does, his eyes widen a fraction, then narrow and stare at Lan Wangji askance. Begrudgingly, he crouches down to start scrubbing his hands in the trickling spring. 

It is quiet a moment. They are away from the bees. The trees shift in the mild breeze; the water laughs on the rocks. 

“Shijie gets headaches,” Wei Wuxian says presently, his wrists red from the water, which pours from the rock cold and clear as ice. He is still scrubbing, not looking up. “Bad ones, sometimes. And fevers. It’s always worse when it rains, like it has all week.”

It is sudden, the change in his voice, stripped of all guile, leaving only sincerity. Lan Wangji says nothing, which Wei Wuxian interprets—as always—as a request to continue. 

“So bad sometimes that even the light hurts,” he says. “There’s not much that helps, but it was very bad the other day, so I went to Wen Qing for medicines.” He makes a face. “You should taste it, Lan Zhan. It’s the worst thing I’ve tasted, worse than your bitter tonic soup. At home we’d have wild honey, you know, to make bad things taste better. So I guess I talked about it a lot, which made us both homesick, which made shijie feel worse so I had to make her feel better. I told her, shijie, surely there is wild honey around. Your beloved brother Wei Ying will find it. And I did.”

He stands up, shaking his hands dry. Lan Wangji realizes with startling clarity that it is easy to tell when Wei Wuxian is telling the truth. He drops the lies, playful or otherwise, the way someone would lower a sword and leave themselves unguarded. 

“She would have been so embarrassed if you caught us,” Wei Wuxian continues. “If I hadn’t asked you permission. So thank you, Lan Zhan.” After a moment, he adds contritely, “I can write more lines if I need to.”

The woods are dappled with sunlight at this hour of the day. Wei Wuxian still has not rolled down his sleeves. His hands are brown from the sun, as are his arms, up to his elbows. There is no line where pale skin starts, the telltale sign of how often his sleeves are not where they should be.

Lan Wangji knows the trick of averting his gaze when his eyes speak too much. He employs it now, just like he had employed it a moment ago to avoid Wei Wuxian’s eyes when they were being honest and dangerous. “No,” he says. 

“No?”

“More lines. There is no need.”

“Oh,” says Wei Wuxian uncertainly, like bait he has dangled has been ignored by the fish. “Ah! Well, that’s good then.” 

“Mn,” Lan Wangji says. 

After a moment, he turns to walk away. Wei Wuxian falls in alongside him, stepping close as they pass through a narrow gap in the trees. He unrolls his sleeves, which fall around him and flutter like cabbage moths in the garden.[^5]

“I guess it’s good then, back there, that I didn’t offer you honeycombs. I would have,” he says. “If it was just up to me. But I thought Lan Zhan would say, *bribery is prohibited.* Principle two-thirty-eight.”

He pauses to see if Lan Wangji will respond to this.

“I’d have to copy a thousand more texts,” Wei Wuxian says faithfully. “Die of old age in the library. Hundreds of years from now, your Lan disciples would say what’s that in the corner? And you’d say, that’s Wei Ying, a pile of dust, because he gave Lan Wangji honeycombs…”

“How do you not get stung?” Lan Wangji blurts abruptly. 

“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says, withdrawing the arm he had jovially bumped against Lan Wangji’s sleeve. “Oh, that? Bees are nice, like I said.” He waves it off. “If you’re calm, they’re calm too. Have you ever been stung? You might have made them mad, or scared them. That stern face of yours, Lan Zhan. That would do it. As long as they aren’t hurt or scared, they’re just happy little bees, buzzing around. I can show you—Lan Zhan.”

Wei Wuxian collides with him, this time because Lan Wangji has stopped in the middle of sun-dappled greenery. Wei Wuxian looks at him, miffed. 

“Butterbur,” Lan Wangji says.[^6]

“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says. He is smart, so Lan Wangji waits for him to make the leap between the word and the leafy foliage at their feet. “Ah,” he says, when he does. “Butterbur. For… what?” 

“Headaches.”

Wei Wuxian looks at him a long time. “Oh,” he says finally, sounding lost, even though they are now only a stone’s throw from the path. He trails his gaze down again, looking around them, the sea of giant, cup-shaped, almost lotus-like leaves. 

“Dry the roots, or boil the leaves. Drink the tea,” Lan Wangji says. 

Wei Wuxian scratches his elbow, looking supremely uncomfortable. “Thanks?” he says. “Lan Zhan? Can you please not do this again?”

Lan Wangji frowns. 

“It’s much more fun when I do something and you say, *ridiculous.* Or try to get me in trouble. I don’t know what to *do* with you when you’re like this, all—” He makes a helpless sound of distaste, gesturing up and down at Lan Wangji’s person. 

Lan Wangji frowns longer, then turns to walk away. Wei Wuxian skips around him, circling in front of him, grabbing his arm. 

“See! That’s much better! Now get mad, say something mean, call me names—”

“Let go,” Lan Wangji says. 

Wei Wuxian drops his hand immediately. He steps backwards, which means he stumbles, and catches himself, and bumps against a tree. 

“Ow,” he says. 

Lan Wangji traps him there, stepping closer. Wei Wuxian goes still, like a deer who knows instinctively he has been sighted as prey.

“Lan Zhan,” he says, and laughs nervously. Just a soft, shaky *ha,* otherwise perfectly willing, Lan Wangji notices, to be pinned against a tree.[^7] He watches as Wei Wuxian swallows, the knot sliding up and down the line of his throat.

It’s too late. He’s too close. He has made a grave miscalculation. He cannot think past the soft shape of Wei Wuxian’s mouth. 

Desire splits him open, like an unpruned sapling too green to carry summer’s ripe fruit.[^8] He is trembling with want. He wants to—he doesn’t even *know enough* to know exactly all the things that he wants, a lack of knowledge that fills him with violent frustration. He wants to *kiss him.* Pale words for what he wants to do. He wants to maul him, bite him, lick him like the honey he hasn’t been given; bruise him like overripe fruit. He wants Wei Wuxian’s hands on him, grasping, Wei Wuxian *kissing him back.* He would need to pin his wrists then, grip his hips, do whatever it takes to wrest back control, hold on to some frayed scrap of his dignity even as the kiss grows longer, and—and gentler, and deeper, and—

Scalded, Lan Wangji takes a step back. Wei Wuxian sways forward, like they’re tethered, reaching after him without thinking before they both freeze in unison, one step apart, staring. Wei Wuxian looks addled, like the surface of a pond where someone has just chucked in a stone.

Lan Wangji desperately wants to hear footsteps coming up the path. Something that will pull them apart; a flock of encroaching disciples, even ones who whisper *jade princess,* cast sly looks at Wei Wuxian and stifle giggles in class.

Nothing happens. No rescue comes. Lan Wangji blinks; Wei Wuxian frowns. Lan Wangji blinks again, giving his head a brief shake to clear it. “Wei Ying,” he says. His gaze resting on the blue and white collar at the base of his throat. 

Something moves. Wei Wuxian looks down. Carefully, haltingly, he parts the top layers of his robe. The little yellow bee, hidden there, flicks her wings, scrubs her legs. Wei Wuxian lifts her out, coaxing her onto the tip of his finger.[^9] The bee perches there for a moment, Wei Wuxian’s eyes going wide and delighted, almost crossing over each other in order to peer at her more closely. Another elegant flick of her wings, and she takes flight, looping over their heads, finally zagging sharply off towards the nearest patch of blossoms.

Wei Wuxian’s laughter is soft and carefree, eyes shining, no longer the least bit off balance. He grins at Lan Wangji and recites, “Never hurt insects or plants,” the eleventh Lan principle. 

“I—” Lan Wangji says, and fights back the words. 

“Me too,” Wei Wuxian says, which shows he has no idea what Lan Wangji was going to say. Lan Wangji doesn’t know either, except it wasn’t anything that would have Wei Wuxian saying, “Shijie will think I’ve gotten lost in the woods,” and tucking his robes tight together, skipping the short distance down to the path that winds its way down the mountain. 

Then he darts back up, sheepishly grinning as he plucks a few stalks of butterbur, wriggling them loose from the earth so the plugs of roots come up with them. 

“Coming, Lan Zhan?” he calls from below, once he is back on the path. 

Lan Wangji shakes his head curtly. Wei Wuxian tosses him a wave and that bright, undaunted smile, and whistles a little as he wanders away.

----

In the cold springs, Lan Wangji doesn’t remove his robes. He sits with the water up to his shoulders, his submerged posture impeccable. His fingers have gone numb by the time they shrivel into prunes. 

“Wangji.” A polite cough. “Wangji? …Wangji.”

Lan Wangji looks up and blinks. He is not sure how long his brother has been sitting there, bare-shouldered, the tail of his ribbons floating in the water. It seems like maybe a while. He looks amused. 

“I said, your lips are blue,” Lan Xichen says gently. 

“No,” Lan Wangji says, rising, reaching for his robe to pull around him—which he is already wearing. He climbs out of the pool, trailing water. It follows him up the path, along with the sound that is either Lan Xichen’s soft laughter or the wind in the trees. 

----

“No,” Lan Wangji says, to everything.

It becomes the pattern of his days. No to Wei Wuxian, who bounces up alongside him with schemes or smiles, or loquats, or warmth he pours out like cups of Lan Wangji’s favorite tea. No to Lan Xichen (who has acquired the untimely habit of saying *yes*). No to company, while hunting water ghosts. No to absurd, clever theories. No to the half dozen flirtations he has to fend off before noon. No so exhaustively, so reflexively, so nonsensically, that Wei Wuxian makes it a game, counting it as a victory when he can get Lan Wangji to say anything else.

Lan Wangji *would* say something else if he knew what to do; if he knew how else to survive this. 

He reaches the ends of his days sweaty with exhaustion. There is no one he can turn to. Uncle—his mind balks. The last place to breathe any words that could connect back to Wei Wuxian is in Lan Qiren’s presence. His brother is no longer a refuge. Even if Lan Wangji were to present his dilemma in hypothetical form, all identifying details removed, Lan Xichen would just smile indulgently, nod sagely, and murmur unhelpful encouragement about cultivating friendships. Lan Wangji loves his brother, but—*honestly.* 

Even books fail him. The poets have two poles on the subject: infatuation, and heartbreak. The books of wisdom offer the same word Lan Wangji already has: *no,* but with nothing else helpful like *how.* Any texts with illustrations give him heart palpitations. He approaches blue covers now the way he would approach a snake in the grass. 

Ironically, miserably, it’s in Wei Wuxian’s presence where he feels like he would have a confidant. Wei Wuxian is undaunted by anything. He would put his clever mind to it, and be kind like with his sister—no. Not on this matter. On this matter he would crow with delight and—probably climb in Lan Wangji’s lap, exhibit *no restraint*—

Lan Wangji is sweaty again. He devotes every spare minute to more cultivation. Even Lan Xichen grows concerned, tells him—*lies to him*—that it’s not a crime nor a sin to enjoy himself. A boy his age, he’s allowed to not be so strict on himself all the time. Pleasure, fun—these are words Lan Xichen uses, a foreign language that Lan Wangji is suddenly expected to know. 

More expectations placed on him. He is aware that even the most sturdy bow snaps under ill-applied pressure, strung with too tight a string. 

He is not a bow, though. Nor a boy. He is—he is *Lan.* 

And he is lost. 

---- 

“No,” Lan Wangji says, when there’s liquor. 

“No,” Lan Wangji says, when he’s drunk. 

“No,” he says wildly, panicked, when Wei Wuxian—also drunk—is just going to crawl in bed beside him, yawning. 

“No,” he says, more painfully, softly, when Wei Wuxian tries to leave. 

“Lan Zhan, I have never known anybody more ridiculous than you are,” Wei Wuxian grumbles, but then does what he always does, finds the space between those two *no’s* and folds himself back down to sit on the floor by the bed.

He unties his sash, his outer robe, getting comfortable. He flings the sash away in the same motion that Lan Wangji bolts upright. 

“Lan Zhan! *Calm down.*” Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes. “You can have one or the other. You can have the bed, or you can have me fully dressed. Can’t have both.”

He takes a swig from the jar, missing half of it with his mouth, wiping his mouth on his sleeve, which distracts Lan Wangji temporarily from the discarded sash. Wei Wuxian rolls his eyes again, placing both hands on Lan Wangji’s shoulders to ease him back down on the bed. 

“See? More comfortable. Yes?” Wei Wuxian says in the patient way people speak to small children. He perches his chin on his hand, observing Lan Wangji for a moment. “Are you going to sleep now? Or call me Wei-gege again?”

Lan Wangji’s ears blaze with heat. He can keep the color off his face if he stares up at the ceiling.

“Hmm,” Wei Wuxian muses. “Not harsh, but refreshing. Soft, yet full bodied. Mature and fragrant.” His eyes widen, happy to put on a display of innocence when Lan Wangji turns to look at him. “Describing the liquor, Lan Zhan. You’re supposed to do that when you drink. All the poets do it.”

Lan Wangji’s description would be *vile.* He keeps that thought to himself, returning to stare unblinking at the ceiling. He can sense instead of see the face Wei Wuxian makes—his *Lan Zhan is so boring* face, a fact they’ve well established—but he is silent for a moment, which gives Lan Wangji’s question the chance to come tumbling out. “What else does one do when one drinks?”

*Fun,* Lan Xichen’s word, the language he is supposed to be learning. One might as well ask an expert. 

“Well,” Wei Wuxian says, taking it seriously. “Dumb stuff. Laugh a lot—things are funnier when you’re drunk. One time Jiang Cheng dared me to steal a boat, and I did, but it leaked, and we sank.” He grins to himself, basking in the memory, then shrugs with one shoulder. “You just play around. Do what you want. Tease the boy you like.”

Lan Wangji cuts his eyes at him. 

“Kiss the boy you like.” Wei Wuxian takes a small sip of liquor. 

Lan Wangji feels the same jolt as when he walked in the room, the sudden little violent reaction at finding Wei Wuxian piled beneath the boys on the bed. Is this what he does when he drinks? Lose all inhibitions, let *someone else*—

“Lan Zhan?” Wei Wuxian says, amused. 

The silence has gone on too long. It is telling, because Wei Wuxian has set aside the jar and folded his arms on the bed, regarding Lan Wangji with interest. 

“No,” Lan Wangji says. 

The familiar response makes a smile bloom on Wei Wuxian’s face, warm and just as familiar.

“Okay. Lan Zhan? Because you could,” he says patiently. “Kiss me, I mean. Just as friends. I wouldn’t mind. I would—”

“No,” Lan Wangji says. It doesn’t sound like his voice. 

Wei Wuxian scoots up a little, propping up on his elbows. Lan Wangji, taken leave of all of his senses, responds without thinking, raising up on one arm to meet him. 

Wei Wuxian looks into his eyes. That lasts for several long moments. Then he is frowning, saying, “Just a little…” and tipping Lan Wangji’s head for him. Lan Wangji has already done something wrong, not known how to fit—with their noses. Even drunk, he is lost, all the way outside the bounds of his meagre experience, unable to know what any sensible person would know how to do—

The kiss happens then. Neatly, chastely. Lips are pressed against his. It is—dry, a little strange. Lan Wangji feels detached, unsure if he’s missed an important instruction. There is no precedent for it. *This is kissing,* occurs in the back of his mind. 

Wei Wuxian opens his eyes, pulling back. He looks—not *disappointed,* but doubtful. Lan Wangji has doubts too. He also has vast experience of the look on Wei Wuxian’s face when he sets his formidable mind against an unforeseen complication. Lan Wangji meets him partway that time, when Wei Wuxian leans back in. 

Better. Still chaste, still dry lips against lips, but Wei Wuxian has softened his mouth. Lan Wangji does the same, never one to let someone outmatch him. A string of soft kisses then, two, three, four, each one polite and studious. Lan Wangji makes a sound of dissatisfaction. 

Wei Wuxian shuffles up closer. He licks his lips, places his hand boldly on Lan Wangji’s chest, leans in and delivers what the kiss has been missing. 

This time it—*oh.* Lan Wangji’s lips part. He lifts up, chasing the kiss, a change of angle, and pressure—their lips slot together. It is wet now, and warm—an impossibly soft, silky heat that snags on his lips and spills down through him the way the liquor had done. *Kissing,* it’s—a little breathless, like drowning, or flying. Wei Wuxian climbs up closer; Lan Wangji’s hand slides around the nape of his neck. They both make a small sound at that, startled. The kiss grows more clumsy, more pressing, Wei Wuxian the one learning places his hands can go. 

It’s—they pull apart. They pant a little, hands stuck in each others’ hair. 

“I didn’t—!” Wei Wuxian protests, letting him go with an alacrity that makes Lan Wangji’s heart give a hard painful kick, until he realizes Wei Wuxian is staring at his ribbon, askew across his forehead.

“Ridiculous,” Lan Wangji says hoarsely, and pulls him back in.

The kiss changes that time, again. Wei Wuxian is almost in his arms, and it makes awareness slide through them, of what exactly they’re doing. The kiss deepens, and slips, and then—Lan Wangji doesn’t even know quite how it happens. They’re still kissing—his hand on Wei Wuxian’s chest—but each kiss recedes, one by one. Like the tide going out. Safer kisses, softer kisses, circling around and arriving back at the polite, uncertain beginning. Lan Wangji lets him go, his hands empty when the last kiss breaks apart. 

“Ah,” Wei Wuxian says, and clears his throat. “Lan Zhan, that was…” He smiles a little, and rallies. “That wasn’t bad. That was good.” He pats Lan Wangji’s chest, job well done, and musters a different smile for him, cheerful and obliging. He looks mussed and—well-kissed, and unspeakably lovely, silver hairpiece askew, outer robe slipping down off his shoulder, his lower lip red where Lan Wangji bit and tugged it at the end. 

“Ah, you can—you can forget all about this in the morning,” Wei Wuxian says reassuringly, patting his chest again. “Never happened. I mean, I’ll probably remember a little, just because it was… and you’re…” Lan Wangji dies a little when he doesn’t finish that sentence. “But I wouldn’t ever—just two friends, drinking. Wouldn’t ever make you lose face. Promise, Lan Zhan. We don’t ever have to talk about it again.”

“No,” Lan Wangji says, but the sound doesn’t quite come out. Wei Wuxian slips away, off the mat, bedding himself down on the floor. His head appears again, too abruptly. 

“*Aren’t* we friends now?” 

Lan Wangji, who is flat on his back again, staring fixedly at the ceiling, shakes his head. 

Wei Wuxian sighs. “Think we *are,*” he mumbles under his breath. “Gave you my bed. Got you drunk. Had fun. Talked.” He sounds like he is counting on his fingers as he rattles this off, perversely leaving off *kissed.* “I do so much for you, Lan Zhan, and you don’t even say, ‘Wei Ying, here, you’re so generous, you should have half of the bed, which is yours in the first place, I would not be so rude—’”

“No.” Lan Wangji finally manages to get the word out. 

“*Fine.*” Wei Wuxian grunts, sounding suspiciously like he is grinning all over. There is too much noise as he shuffles around, fumbling and settling and trying to get comfortable.

And then there is too much quiet. 

His head pops up again. “Hey, Lan Zhan, I have books! Sometimes I read, when I can’t sleep—”

“*No,*” Lan Wangji says, so forcefully that there is no doubt this time about Wei Wuxian’s grin. He beams at him, draping his arm across the foot of the bed, the position in which he has apparently decided to sleep. 

“Whatever,” he says blithely, poking Lan Wangji’s ankle before he closes his eyes. “Just don’t complain at me in the morning, when you haven’t slept and have a headache so bad you can’t open your eyes, because you didn’t take my advice, and then everybody says, what’s wrong with Lan Zhan, usually he’s so mean but now he just looks adorable, I feel sorry for him, I think he must actually be a very nice person…”

----

It’s almost alarming, in hindsight, how little anything changes. 

Lan Wangji wakes up the next morning—Wei Wuxian doubled over laughing, trying to shake him awake, pull him up off the *floor*—mortification scalding the entire surface of Lan Wangji’s skin—but none of it forces a reckoning, nor a major point of departure, nor a fork in the road from which he is unable to return.

All of that happened weeks ago—*months*. That’s the truth that dawns on him throughout the course of the day. He has already discovered so much new terrain in himself that he just… feels like himself. A little bitchy, a little terrified; miserable with longing and unrepentant and still utterly lost as to what he will do. 

Wei Wuxian doesn’t go anywhere. He squawks in protest at their punishment; he chases Lan Wangji through the cold springs. He is just like himself too, infuriating and loyal and—oddly quiet, robes dripping, watching Lan Wangji tie his ribbon around their wrists. 

*That* should feel strange, at least. New. A fundamental shift between them. Instead, it feels like it has all summer, a fate that has stuck them together, half-wedded, half-doomed. 

None of it can last. This Lan Wangji knows. There is no future for them with Wei Wuxian happily ensconced at his side. He does not belong here, with three thousand rules and bitter soup served at mealtimes and the sour-faced, severe Second Jade who takes it as courtesy when his personality is described as merely aloof. 

This boy who calls his sword *Whatever.* This young man of grace, mischief, and beauty, too wild-hearted for the Gusu Lan to contain.

Lan Wangji knows all of this, and still it slides into his heart like a blade, Wei Wuxian painting lanterns, pledging words about duty and justice, wishing to have a clear conscience all the days of his life. 

And that—*that* feels like a turning point. A thousand tiny fires trapped inside him,[^10] lifting up like the lanterns away from the mountain, into the sky.
