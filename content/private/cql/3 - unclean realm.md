Wei Wuxian is dead. 

Two months, then three. That’s what people begin saying. 

*Beat him like a sandbag,* a Wen soldier boasts. Laughter. *Showed that arrogant brat.* Snap of a cord around a neck. 

Nobody has answers. Jin Zixuan says, *His sister says it isn’t like him…* Jiang Wanyin says, *We thought he went to Lanling for you.* 

It’s unthinkable, what else they say. Burial Mounds. No one survives it. Nobody returns from that place with body or soul intact, not even Wei Wuxian.

This is war, and that’s warfare: wild and unfounded rumors. Lan Wangji tells himself that. He holds out hope, he builds defenses. Becomes as stubborn as he has ever been in his life. Wei Wuxian would be proud. Wei Wuxian would call him a ridiculous person. Wei Wuxian would tackle him with exuberance, say, *Lan Zhan, I’m all right! What on earth were you thinking? You really did all that for me?*

This is not what happens. 

This happens instead: Wen Chao dies, and Wei Wuxian lives. It’s Lan Wangji’s wildest dream, and it comes true like a nightmare. Like a ghost that stands before him in Wei Wuxian’s robes, alive in Wei Wuxian’s body, and not Wei Wuxian at all. 

*Who do you think you are?* this new Wei Wuxian asks him, dark eyes that don’t spark with laughter, a smile that doesn’t reach past his lips. *Second Young Master Lan. Hanguang-jun. Lan Wangji*—the cold reversal of every intimacy that Wei Wuxian has given him. Malevolent energy so tangible it almost coils in the air. 

All Lan Wangji can think, in that moment and after, through the turmoil and betrayal: 

*Who are* you? *Wei Ying, what on earth have you done?*

---- 

It is an artful performance—no wonder Lan Wangji endures an excruciating week of believing it. 

He takes grim solace in the guqin. Wei Wuxian is hailed a hero. “Lan Wangji,” he says politely whenever they cross each other’s path, slid like a knife between his ribs. 

Rumors fly that they’re fighting, but it’s nothing so clear cut as a fight, it’s just confusion and distance. Lan Wangji craves a fight, fights make Wei Wuxian *smile,* a clash of swords like a dance except Wei Wuxian won’t even carry Suibian around with him, not even to deflect suspicion.

“Young Master Wei has always been difficult,” Lan Xichen notes wryly. (Lan Xichen, who has returned himself, also changed, also more polite than ever, a new shadow in his eyes.)

It’s more than Lan Wangji can bear. He sits awake in the tender, bruised-purple hour before dawn, calming his mind with meditation, when the tiny splinter of a thought finally pushes to the fore. 

Everything about this feels familiar. Cool silence, cutting words—it’s Lan Wangji’s own tactics, turned against him. It’s exactly how he tried to survive that interminable summer in Cloud Recesses, in so deep over his head he couldn’t see a way out. Or the long days in Qishan, needing to keep Wei Wuxian out of harm’s way, desperately feigning indifference while Wen Chao stalked them like a wolf. 

Whatever Wei Wuxian has done—he is trying to guard Lan Wangji from it. Or whatever has been done to him—he is trying to stubbornly survive it himself. 

Which is just… fuck, it’s *just like him.* Noble and *stupid* and it’s all Lan Wangji can do to not fly across the compound, drag him out of bed, throttle sense into him until Wei Wuxian capitulates and gives him the *truth.* 

He is more subtle than that, in the end. Although not by much. If Wei Wuxian wants to play by old tactics, then Lan Wangji will give him old tactics. He pulls Bichen, drives him back with a flurry of his most vicious sword work. It feels *right,* like a kiss, to land the blade at his throat.

It works. It’s their old language of provocation and combat, the calling of each other’s bluff. Wei Wuxian drops the act, drops his guard, and Lan Wangji’s heart sings like the blade he drops back in its sheath as the real Wei Wuxian, raw and rattled and honest, finally, *finally,* meets his gaze. 

---- 

They talk, on the rooftop. The first rooftop, since the last rooftop. Tentatively, they bridge part of the gap between them, begin to forge a new path. There are still acres of terrain that Wei Wuxian is avoiding—Lan Wangji lets him. He has every intention of not giving up, of plying trust out of him the way Wei Wuxian plied him first, with friendship, with relentless, annoying, dogged endurance, not content until Lan Wangji was malleable clay in his hands. 

It’s not enough, and it’s a start. The first green shoot of spring after a desolate winter. Lan Wangji would stay there all night; it’s Wei Wuxian who leaves. *Yes,* he agrees, though, to Lan Wangji’s offer of help. Wicked tricks, crafty tricks, Lan Wangji isn’t sure the semantics matter. It’s just like Wei Wuxian to go and do something rash, but whatever he’s done, Lan Wangji can believe that he had his reasons, and Lan Wangji will stick by him until they can solve it together. 

Back in his rooms, Lan Xichen appears in the doorway as Lan Wangji plays the qin. He stands there quietly, listening for a while until Lan Wangji moves through the coda, resting his hands on the strings instead of looping the melody endlessly again. 

“I haven’t heard that piece before,” Lan Xichen says, and something soft twinges in Lan Wangji’s heart—how long they have been apart; how much has changed for him without his brother’s knowledge. It feels disloyal, almost, to hold secrets from him. To not disclose what has happened, where his heart’s loyalties lie. 

“Mn,” is all he says. 

“It’s lovely. Did you compose it?”

“Mn.”

“May I join you for the next one?”

Lan Wangji assents. His brother draws out Liebing, and the sudden association of a flute makes Lan Wangji pause. After a moment, he asks—are there Lan temperament techniques he might not be aware of, more advanced methods than the ones he was taught? 

“Perhaps,” Lan Xichen says thoughtfully. “If we…” He trails off, unable to finish the sentence. *If we return to Cloud Recesses… if it’s rebuilt, if those texts still exist…* “I will see what I can find for you,” he says, and offers Lan Wangji a wan smile. 

---- 

It’s with great relief that Lan Wangji slips back into the background, ceding Lan Xichen his rightful place as the head of the clan. Leadership doesn’t suit him; too much finesse is needed, a constant tolerance of people’s behavior, a level of political tact that is quite frankly beyond him.

He still attends the long meetings, the endless hours of plotting strategy, but only as an auxiliary. No one looks to him to speak, which is a relief, especially when tempers flare, the strain wearing them all down like an iron cask beneath water. 

Jiang Wanyin is just as ill-suited for the role. He is both deferential and belligerent, wearing his newfound authority like an ill-fitting cloak. He clashes with Wei Wuxian daily. It becomes a common occurrence to hear one or both of their voices rising, bouncing off the courtyard walls. Lan Wangji, if he’s in earshot, places himself nearby, in case Wei Wuxian should wish for an escape. It irks Jiang Wanyin, who’s regained his old habit of scowling at Lan Wangji for the mere fact of his existence, their uneasy truce collapsing. 

“He’s just worried,” Wei Wuxian says after one of their spats, sounding tired, sounding restless, falling into his old habit too of defending his sect brother. “Shijie says he’s not sleeping.”

“Are you?” Lan Wangji asks. 

“Ha! Me? Lan Zhan. I sleep *too much,* like a baby. You can’t even wake me in the mornings.”

It’s a lie, and a transparent one. Lan Wangji rises before dawn, and too often now he finds Wei Wuxian awake during those hours, prowling around on some errand or toying with notes on his flute, purple shadows beneath his eyes like bruises. If Jiang Yanli is on duty, then he haunts the kitchens, keeping her company as she oversees preparations for the day’s meals. That’s where Lan Wangji finds him most mornings—sleeves rolled up, tasked with some chore, looking more at home there than amongst the clan leaders or the troops in the field. He’s hiding out, Lan Wangji knows, but as pale and thin as he is—there are worse places than the kitchens. 

“A-Xian, stop!” Jiang Yanli’s voice wafts from the kitchens on this particular morning. A scolding sing-song as she—Lan Wangji glimpses through the doorway—shoos him off a tray of dumplings. 

“Shijie!” Mouth full. “But it’s so delicious. I’m starving.”

“You are not.” 

Deftly, she sets a basket of leeks in his arms, with directions on where to take it. Deftly, he ditches it, returning like a fly to the pot of soup bubbling away on the fire, dipping a spoon into it as soon as her back is turned. Lan Wangji, who has not seen him pick at more than a few bites in the dining hall all week, takes note. Apparently his sister has mastered this art—the way to get Wei Wuxian to eat more than his share is to scold him for doing so. Lan Wangji would nag him to eat, and then Wei Wuxian would get stubborn. 

“Xianxian!” she says, turning around to catch him. “Are you three years old? Behave yourself.” 

“Xianxian *is* behaving,” he says, a pout that is rendered partially ineffective by the amount of food in his mouth. He swallows it down, dipping the spoon again. “Xianxian is being *so* good. Xianxian deserves a—”

“Hanguang-jun,” Jiang Yanli says, suddenly abashed, catching sight of Lan Wangji.

Wei Wuxian turns around. The mood doesn’t change, exactly, but his smile shifts, a shade more mannered, less playful than it had been a moment before. He purposefully relaxes his shoulders, walking over, aware of his sister’s eyes on him, and says warmly, “Lan Zhan. What are you doing here at this hour? Did you miss me?”

It is just as purposeful and flippant as the rest, the kind of thing Wei Wuxian says so no one takes him seriously. He is still holding the spoon, and he lifts it, other hand cupped beneath it, offering Lan Wangji a taste. 

It’s a dare. Or a bluff. “You’ll offend shijie,” he pouts. “After I told you so many times how she makes the best soup in the world.”

Jiang Yanli has been distracted by one of the cooks, conferring over a list of ingredients. They might as well be in private on this side of the room. Lan Wangji doesn’t allow himself to relent, his lips pressed tightly together, and Wei Wuxian’s face softens, swallowing the spoonful himself without further teasing. 

“You would have died for food like this in Xuanwu Cave,” Wei Wuxian chides him lightly. A shadow flickers in his eyes. “How’s your leg? I never asked.”

It feels like a lifetime ago, the broken bone, a promise that Wei Wuxian never heard in the throes of a fever. The Jin physicians were qualified; the bone has fully mended. 

Lan Wangji nods. 

Wei Wuxian softens his face again. “See? Lan Zhan. Told you we would be heroes.” He turns, raising his voice for an audience before Lan Wangji realizes they have one. “Shijie? Aren’t we heroes? Told Lan Zhan we would be, even though he doesn’t ever believe me.”

Jiang Yanli, composure intact once more, sets down a tray of teacups beside a pot of fragrant tea. “Yes, you’re heroes,” she says, with the air of one used to indulging Wei Wuxian, patting his head fondly, which he has bowed so she could reach. She begins pouring tea for the three of them, neatly sidestepping any refusals Lan Wangji could make by simply not giving him a choice. 

Wei Wuxian smiles as she does this, one of his most interior smiles, as if it’s only for himself, basking for a moment in the comfort of being so well-loved. Lan Wangji cannot blame him. Something twists in his heart; an old pain, years old, a longing so acute it almost takes his breath away. If he could have this, he would bask in it too, like a dry ground soaks up rain. 

---- 

One would think Lan Wangji would be well suited for it, the regimental discipline of the military, the sameness of the routine stamped out day after day. The logistical preparations for battle, the methodical drills, the painstaking adherence to regulations. 

Only if one didn’t know him. It does not suit him at all, wearying him beyond measure. Discipline should be spiritual, aimed at higher cultivation, not for training men to march toward death in the proper formations. He misses the crisp air of Cloud Recesses, the musty solitude of the library, with a palpable ache. 

Wei Wuxian—to exactly no one’s surprise—chafes under it too. He is as intractable as ever, disappearing for long stretches of time, dodging any duty that doesn’t involve the kitchens or his sister. There is an ongoing quarrel where he refuses to run sword drills with the Yunmeng recruits. As punishment—Lan Wangji’s homesick heart almost yearns—Wei Wuxian is banished to the storeroom, tasked with taking inventory. He and Lan Xichen, when they hear this, exchange an inscrutable look. 

“Hanguang-jun,” Wei Wuxian greets him when Lan Wangji goes to find him. It’s the jovial tone that still puts distance between them, not quite the warm teasing that has always drawn Lan Wangji in. “To what do I owe the honor? If you’ve come to lecture me on duty and diligence, I’ve heard it all from Jiang Cheng.”

Torches line the walls of the room, flickering as Lan Wangji passes. The stone is thick, the air cool and stale underground. Lan Wangji cannot help but think—all in all, he prefers rooftops. 

“No,” he says. 

“Then they’ve sent you to watch me? Ah, Lan Wangji, like old times.”

The last few Nie disciples have scattered at the sight of him, leaving them alone in the room. “No,” Lan Wangji says again. No one has sent him; he has no excuse. *Want to be near you,* true as it is, seems a desperate thing to say. 

“No?” Wei Wuxian says. “What then? Lan Zhan is here to *help*?” 

Lan Wangji walks up beside him, observing the mess over his shoulder. Several logbooks are spread open, the pages in disarray, the columns inked crookedly. Ink stains Wei Wuxian’s fingertips; a streak of it is smudged on his chin. Lan Wangji half expects to spot a pair of stick figures kissing. He endures the violent fit of nostalgia, mentally tallying a column, finding the figures are correct even if the brushwork is appalling. “You’ll never learn, if I help.” 

“I’ll never learn anyway,” Wei Wuxian promises. Happiness lights his face, cheerfully surrendering the brush as Lan Wangji takes it from him. Lan Wangji locates a fresh page, tracing a neat column. 

“Tent stakes,” Lan Wangji requests, and Wei Wuxian moves off to find them, a full crate he starts counting one by one. 

---- 

They work til nightfall, the tedious labor at least offering a refuge from the ceaseless buzz of activity in the fortress. 

Even Wei Wuxian is diligent, exhibiting admirable discipline. He comments occasionally on their progress, or notes the state of some item he has found in disrepair, reporting each count faithfully to Lan Wangji, who inks it down with precision. It reminds Lan Wangji, strangely, of the cave, the few hours of collecting and unstringing bows, working in quiet companionship. An ease they rarely achieved in the library, Wei Wuxian too antsy, too full of talk most days, too keen on pranks and flirtation. 

Lan Wangji would welcome that too, if there was chatter. There is a new stillness to Wei Wuxian that is equal parts pleasing and disturbing. Lan Wangji can recognize it—the kind of stillness borne from solitude. His restless energy hasn’t ceased, it has just been… channeled. Controlled, contained. 

These long months that have passed, that Wei Wuxian will barely speak of—has he been alone? Has loneliness etched its way through him without his permission, the way a river carves a landscape? That amount of solitude would be difficult enough for Lan Wangji, who knows how to endure it. Depriving Wei Wuxian of talk, of simple daily companionship, would be like depriving him of air.

“Lan Zhan, I’m done,” Wei Wuxian announces abruptly, in the middle of a column and a half-finished crate. He drops the lid closed and sits atop it, rolling the stiffness out of his shoulders. Testing Lan Wangji like he expects an objection. 

Lan Wangji has none. He folds the logbook closed, laying the brush aside. From his sleeve, he unwraps a pair of steamed buns, tucked there for just such a purpose. He offers one to Wei Wuxian, who stares at him a long moment. Finally he accepts it, taking a bite, wiping off his hands on his robes.

“Mmm,” he says begrudgingly, at the mild kick of spice, the best that Qinghe can do. “Guess you didn’t bring any wine.” 

His eyes go comically wide as Lan Wangji produces that too. 

“We are not in Cloud Recesses,” Lan Wangji says stiffly, to the appalled shock in his gaze. 

Wei Wuxian has already uncorked it, gulping down half of it, wiping his chin on his sleeve. “Hanguang-jun, what’s gotten into you? Next you’ll be courting me naked in public.”

The words drop like a stone to the bottom of a well. The silence echoes a moment, the torches shuddering along the walls. 

Carefully, awkwardly, they each step around the sentence. Wei Wuxian holds out the wine, a peace offering, then winces, withdrawing it before Lan Wangji can refuse it, shaking his head. “Right. Sorry,” he says softly. 

There is nothing to do for a moment but finish their food in silence. They each swallow the last bites, Lan Wangji delicately, Wei Wuxian washing his down with another gulp of the wine. 

“When did you learn to play?” Lan Wangji asks. 

Wei Wuxian blinks up at him. “Huh?” Surprise at the question followed by willingness to accept a change of subject. 

“The flute. When did you learn?”

That had been part of the shock in the courier station when Wei Wuxian reappeared. His exquisite prowess with the music. Lan Wangji, who has played the qin since he was five, lessons commencing before his small fingers could even span the strings, knows full well that one does not wake up overnight—nor return from the dead—with that level of skill. 

“Oh. Um. Never learned. Not formally,” Wei Wuxian adds quickly, as if sensing Lan Wangji’s distaste. He shrugs. “Just played around. Liked it, when I was young. Listened to others, played what I heard. Got better at it.”

Of course Wei Wuxian did. Of course he didn’t endure years of rigorous discipline. Of course he just *liked* it, and taught himself for the pleasure of it, not caring if he excelled. 

“It was after I came to Lotus Pier,” Wei Wuxian elaborates. “Uncle Jiang said I got it from my mother, my knack with music. Said she was so clever, she could hear a song once and play it. She loved music. It made me feel…” He falters, his cheeks acquiring a little stain of color. As if he’s said more than he meant to, and feels exposed. 

“My—” Lan Wangji says, and has to swallow. “My mother also. Loved music.”

“Yeah?”

“Yes.”

The silence has a softer, less difficult quality this time. Wei Wuxian reaches behind him and pauses, then draws out the flute from his belt. He rolls the lacquered finish in his fingers, looking at Lan Wangji for permission. 

Lan Wangji nods.

It is haunting, the first note Wei Wuxian draws from the flute. Not like before—not foul, something that roils in the air like it belongs in a grave. There is no resentful energy with it. No wisp of dark smoke, no trace of spiritual power. Just a song that begins to curl through the air, beautiful. Spun like silk, like a spell, captivating, exquisite. A gleaming thread of tension runs through the melody like a river in the moonlight. 

Lan Wangji takes an involuntary step forward. Wei Wuxian has his eyes closed, his lashes dark on his cheeks. Lan Wangji cannot do the same, cannot shut his eyes; he drifts in closer, as if summoned, his musician’s mind working to make sense of the notes. They tumble over each other, spilling forth from the flute, as the song shifts again, deepens. It grows moody. Seductive. Plaintive and yearning. It wraps tendrils around Lan Wangji like a creature that could drown him. 

“Did you write this?” Lan Wangji asks, when the last note wavers, winking out like a rushlight between them. It is like nothing he’s heard in Gusu, which is what Wei Wuxian always does to him. 

Wei Wuxian shakes his head no. “It’s a Yunmeng love song,” he says. “I’ve heard it since I was a child.” He pauses, voice soft as he recalls the old story. “There are two lovers. They run away, and offend the immortals. As punishment, they are cursed, banished for eternity to opposite sides of the river. Every night, in the moonlight, they sing this song to each other, back and forth across the water.”

The torchlight flickers in the air.

“Is that what we are?” Lan Wangji asks hoarsely. 

“Which?” Wei Wuxian says. “Lovers, or cursed?”

It is not gentle, the kiss. It is months of hunger, of need. Lan Wangji drags Wei Wuxian to the edge of the crate, bends him back across it. When they break off the kiss, Wei Wuxian runs his hands into Lan Wangji’s hair, and then buckles forward, burying his face in the crook of his neck. He just breathes there, a little raggedly, holding Lan Wangji to him and filling his lungs. As if this—his scent, his warmth, the taste and feel of his skin—is what Wei Wuxian has been deprived of. A need as elemental as sunlight, or air.

Lan Wangji has heard the difference between this song on the flute and the song he’s composed. His is wistful, naive, sweet stirrings of longing in an innocent heart. Friendship pledged; love desired. The fulfillment to be found in years of faithful companionship. A love song composed by someone who doesn’t know the first thing about love, in the body, the earthiness of it—the fire and the wild hunger of physical touch.

That’s what the kiss becomes again, slowly. It builds, the heat of it, the need. Wei Wuxian drags his hands all over Lan Wangji’s chest, down his back, parting his legs to catch Lan Wangji between them. Lan Wangji falls against him, almost sprawling them down on top of the crate. He is kissing urgently, breathlessly, needing air less than he needs Wei Wuxian pressed against him. All Wei Wuxian does is drag him closer, clutch him tighter, return the kiss with satisfying ferocity, evenly matched, even in this.

A gate clanks open in the distance. Footsteps on the stone. For a wild, reckless moment they still kiss, pulling apart—Lan Wangji biting Wei Wuxian’s lip—a mere heartbeat before they can be discovered, the footsteps rounding the corner into the room. 

It is one of Jiang Wanyin’s men. When he arrives, barely bowing, they are standing apart, Lan Wangji inspecting a nearby crate. “Clan leader Jiang wishes to speak with you,” the man says to Wei Wuxian, his manners glib, nearly insolent, for addressing a clan leader’s brother. Lan Wangji almost starts forward, stopping only when Wei Wuxian’s lazy voice gets there first. 

“Tomorrow,” he says, the glint of rebellion that makes him all edges, sharp as a blade. 

The man begins to say something, deny him that choice. 

“Tomorrow,” Wei Wuxian states again, with finality. 

Lan Wangji asserts his own authority, sweeping past the man without a glance or a word. Wei Wuxian follows, twirling the flute with blithe indifference until they are outside and he exhales, releasing a tension he hasn’t shown until it’s dark and they’re alone. 

“Wei Ying.”

“No,” Wei Wuxian says, his voice a dozen different things. He shakes his head tiredly. “Don’t spoil it.”

Lan Wangji doesn’t. The night is quiet, outdoors. The fresh air pleasant on his skin. They cross the courtyard, bathed in silver, the moon reflected in the fountains. Idly strolling, no desire to reach the end of the evening. Drifting close enough their sleeves brush, no one around to observe.

Lan Wangji allows himself to wonder if there is something more to it, this soft and brimming silence, Wei Wuxian’s new willingness for it. Perhaps—perhaps some part of it isn’t only the strain of secrecy, or the aftermath of an ordeal. Perhaps Wei Wuxian is also revealing a different side of himself. Allowing Lan Wangji in, trusting him with a part of himself that he does not show the world. Absorbing Lan Wangji’s quiet, no need to shatter it like glass into pieces on the floor. 

That’s what it feels like, in the moonlight, when they arrive back at Lan Wangji’s quarters. Wei Wuxian lingers, not eager to rush off towards his own. 

There are deep shadows at the door. Lan Wangji takes his wrist, drawing them both into the shadows, hidden enough from view to kiss him again. 

It isn’t full of heat, right away—not a resumption of the storeroom, not immediately leading to anything. It’s just connecting again, content with just this. Lan Wangji presses against him, Wei Wuxian’s hands running lightly over his back, drinking him in.

Lost in it, they barely hear when another set of footsteps approach. A passing guard, making his rounds. Wei Wuxian, instead of pulling apart, instinctively presses them deeper into the shadows, blocking the white of Lan Wangji’s robes with the black of his own. 

Lan Wangji has never been the one pinned. Wei Wuxian had crowded around him in the Xuanwu Cave but that had been out of necessity, avoiding his injured leg. It’s different like this. His pulse spikes, hands dropping to rest at Wei Wuxian’s waist. The flute stings him, tucked in his belt. A strange jolt of sensation. Sharp but not unpleasant, like being flicked.

Perversely, all it does is make him want Wei Wuxian more. Whatever he has done, whatever this dark power is, Lan Wangji *knows* it is wrong and that wrongness is not enough to keep him away. There’s a hunger just as dark within himself—like calling to like, the danger of it attracting him, not repelling him. The new Wei Wuxian, so very nearly the same as the old Wei Wuxian, wicked, ingenious, defiant to a fault, lays a kiss on his lips. 

Lan Wangji opens up to him. It is deeper, slower, the kiss, out here in the dark. Heat prickles his spine, pools in his joints, gathers low in his belly—lower. He feels dangerously sober this time, nothing like the night Wei Wuxian made him drink liquor, or the heady exploration in the cave. For once in his life he knows exactly what he is doing and is doing it anyway. 

“Lan Zhan,” Wei Wuxian breathes, mouth on his neck again, nuzzling the spot where his pulse beats soft and frantic beneath his skin. 

“Wei Ying,” he whispers hoarsely, his grip so tight on Wei Wuxian’s arms he can feel the bone beneath muscle. 

Wei Wuxian is unperturbed. He *likes* it, Lan Wangji realizes, knowledge that Lan Wangji does *not* need to have. Wei Wuxian is responding to it, teeth sinking down, tugging sharp, sweet, biting kisses up and down Lan Wangji’s throat until he abruptly groans at the ridiculous pattern repeating and pulls them apart. 

Lan Xichen appears on the path. Lan Wangji, who could not hear his silent approach, feels like he has been caught naked in the moonlight. Lan Xichen looks startled too, a wrinkle he immediately smoothes out into a placid smile. 

Wei Wuxian, with his superior instincts for self-preservation, stands respectfully apart from Lan Wangji, bowing. 

“Young Master Wei,” Lan Xichen greets him, nodding in return. 

*We were just—* An excuse tries to fight its way to the tip of Lan Wangji’s tongue. Before it can, Wei Wuxian simply says, “Lan Zhan, goodnight. Zewu-jun,” and bows again in farewell.

They both stand there watching as he slips away in the dark. Lan Xichen turns, casting his gaze at Lan Wangji again, who cannot meet it. At the top of the steps, Lan Xichen opens the door, light spilling out to meet him, and turns to look at Lan Wangji again. 

Lan Wangji can *feel* when his gaze lands on the marks on his neck, the slight disorder of his collar, the hair that must be out of place. He musters so much dignity that he is almost indignant as he steps past his brother through the door. 

“Wangji,” Lan Xichen says, when they are both inside, doors firmly closed. 

“Brother,” Lan Wangji says formally, presenting a face of stone and a challenge. 

Something shifts in Lan Xichen’s expression again, long-suffering and bewildered. He is tired enough to say the words without restraint: “I do not want to see you hurt.”

Lan Wangji is still off-balance enough to reply: “I do not want to see *him* hurt.”

Lan Xichen closes his eyes. There are new lines around them, etched there the past months and only visible when he is not presenting someone with the practiced serenity of his countenance. “If he has the Yin Iron, if he’s…”

“He does not,” Lan Wangji says, weary enough himself that he ends the inquiry there, leaving Lan Xichen to stare after him as he abruptly departs for his side of their rooms. 

At the qin, he sinks down, sitting there a long time without moving his hands, resting them across the strings. He picks out the melody in his head, note by note, over and over, working through it in silence until he is halfway confident it is faithful. It might even take half the night, but only when he knows which strings to pluck from beginning to end does he play the first note. 

A Yunmeng love song, more limpid when it was played on the flute. On the qin, it is solemn, more wistful—but then, everything Lan Wangji plays is. He hits a wrong note, finds the right one, reconstructing the strange tune from memory. Foreign to his fingers, a new thing, well beyond his realm of experience. 

He can learn, though. He can expand his knowledge of this subject—of the world around him. Expand his knowledge of himself. 

He half expects Wei Wuxian to appear, summoned like a spirit by the music, flashing a bright, hungry grin. Wei Wuxian does not, but he is somewhere nearby, within the walls of the fortress. 

Lan Wangji plays, as he does often, as if it is a conversation. A call and response between them. As if Wei Wuxian could hear.

---- 

Note: the story WWX mentions re: the love song is super loosely based on [the cowherd and the weaver] (Vega and Altair). That myth came to mind when I needed a pair of cursed lovers, but a) there’s no way LWJ wouldn’t know it already, and b) I wanted a song that would be a dark mirror to WuJi, so I took the liberty of imagining a more regional, sensual, folk song version of it that might have, say, sprung up around a river-dwelling clan, where the heavenly lovers and their celestial river gets echoed in the earthbound river itself. 

You could do worse, though, than to imagine it as music set to [the poem of Qin Guan]:

> Through the varying shapes of the delicate clouds, the sad message of the shooting stars, a silent journey across the Milky Way. One meeting of the Cowherd and Weaver amidst the golden autumn wind and jade-glistening dew, eclipses the countless meetings in the mundane world. The feelings soft as water, the ecstatic moment unreal as a dream, how can one have the heart to go back on the bridge made of magpies? If the two hearts are united forever, why do the two persons need to stay together—day after day, night after night?
