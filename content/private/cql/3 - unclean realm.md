Wei Wuxian is dead. 

Two months, then three. That’s what people begin saying. 

*Beat him like a sandbag,* a Wen soldier boasts. Laughter. *Showed that arrogant brat.* Snap of a cord around a neck. 

Nobody has answers. Jin Zixuan says, *His sister says it isn’t like him…* Jiang Wanyin says, *We thought he went to Lanling for you.* 

It’s unthinkable, what else they say. Burial Mounds. No one survives it. Nobody returns from that place with body or soul intact, not even Wei Wuxian.

This is war, and that’s warfare: wild and unfounded rumors. Lan Wangji tells himself that. He holds out hope, he builds defenses. Becomes as stubborn as he has ever been in his life. Wei Wuxian would be proud. Wei Wuxian would call him a ridiculous person. Wei Wuxian would tackle him with exuberance, say, *Lan Zhan, I’m all right! What were you thinking, you really did all that for me?*

This is not what happens. 

This happens instead: Wen Chao dies, and Wei Wuxian lives. It’s Lan Wangji’s wildest dream, and it comes true like a nightmare. Like a ghost that stands before him in Wei Wuxian’s robes, alive in Wei Wuxian’s body, and not Wei Wuxian at all. 

*Who do you think you are?* this new Wei Wuxian asks him, dark eyes that don’t spark with laughter, a smile that doesn’t reach past his lips. *Second Young Master Lan. Hanguang-jun. Lan Wangji*—the cold reversal of every intimacy that Wei Wuxian has ever given him. Malevolent energy so tangible it almost coils in the air. 

All Lan Wangji can think, in that moment and after, through the turmoil and betrayal: 

*Who are* you? *Wei Ying, what on earth have you done?*

---- 

It is an artful performance—no wonder Lan Wangji endures an excruciating week of believing it.

He takes grim solace in the guqin. Wei Wuxian is hailed a hero. “Lan Wangji,” he says politely whenever they cross each other’s path, slid like a knife between his ribs. 

Rumors fly that they’re fighting, but it’s nothing so clear cut as a fight, it’s just confusion and distance. Lan Wangji craves a fight, fights make Wei Wuxian *smile,* a clash of swords like a dance except Wei Wuxian won’t even carry Suibian around with him, not even to deflect suspicion.

“Young Master Wei has always been difficult,” Xichen notes wryly. (Xichen, who has returned himself, also changed, also more polite than ever, a new shadow in his eyes.)

It’s more than Lan Wangji can bear. He sits awake in the tender, bruised-purple hour before dawn, calming his mind with meditation, when the tiny splinter of a thought finally pushes to the fore. 

Everything about this feels familiar. Cool silence, cutting words—it’s Lan Wangji’s own tactics, turned against him. How he tried to survive it, that interminable summer in Cloud Recesses, in so deep over his head he couldn’t see a way out. Or the long days in Qishan, needing to keep Wei Wuxian out of harm’s way, desperately feigning indifference while Wen Chao stalked them like a wolf. 

Whatever Wei Wuxian has done—he is trying to guard Lan Wangji from it. Or whatever has been done to him—he is trying to stubbornly survive it himself. 

Which is just… fuck, it’s *just like him.* Noble and *stupid* and it’s all Lan Wangji can do to not fly across the compound, drag him out of bed, throttle sense into him until Wei Wuxian capitulates and gives him the *truth.* 

He is more subtle than that, in the end—although not by much. If Wei Wuxian wants to play by old tactics, then Lan Wangji will give him old tactics. He pulls Bichen, drives him back with a flurry of his most vicious sword work. It feels *right,* like a kiss, to land the blade at his throat.

It works. It’s their old language, provocation and combat, the calling of each other’s bluff. Lan Wangji’s heart sings like the blade he drops back in its sheath as Wei Wuxian finally, *finally,* sweet as a taste of cool water, meets Lan Wangji’s gaze, like the Wei Wuxian he knows.

They talk, on the rooftop. The first tentative forging of a new path between them. There are still acres of terrain that Wei Wuxian is avoiding—Lan Wangji lets him. He has every intention of not giving up, of plying trust out of him the way Wei Wuxian plied him first, with friendship, with relentless, dogged endurance, not content until Lan Wangji was malleable clay in his hands. 
It’s not enough, and it’s a start. The first green shoot of spring after a desolate winter. Lan Wangji would stay there all night; it’s Wei Wuxian who leaves. *Yes,* he agrees, though, to Lan Wangji’s offer of help. Wicked tricks, crafty tricks, Lan Wangji isn’t sure the semantics matter. It’s just like Wei Wuxian to go and do something rash, but whatever he’s done, Lan Wangji can believe that he had his reasons, and they can solve it together. 
Back in his rooms, Xichen appears in the doorway as Lan Wangji plays the qin. He stands there quietly, listening for a while until Lan Wangji moves through the coda, resting his hands on the strings instead of looping the melody endlessly again. 
“I haven’t heard that piece before,” Xichen says, and something soft twinges in Lan Wangji’s chest—how long they have been apart; how much has changed for him without his brother’s knowledge. It feels disloyal, almost, to hold secrets from him. To not disclose what has happened, where part of his loyalties lie. 
“Mn,” is all he says. 
“It’s lovely. May I join you?”
Lan Wangji assents. His brother draws out Liebing, and the sudden association of a flute makes Lan Wangji pause. After a moment, he asks—are there Lan temperament techniques he might not be aware of, more advanced methods than the ones he was taught? 
“Perhaps,” Xichen says thoughtfully. “If we…” He trails off, unable to finish the sentence. *If we return to Cloud Recesses… if it’s rebuilt, if those texts still exist…* “I will see what I can find for you,” he says, and offers Lan Wangji a wan smile.

Lan Wangji slips back into the background, ceding Xichen his rightful place as the head of the clan. He is more than happy to do it. Leadership doesn’t suit him; too much finesse is needed, a level of political tact that is quite frankly beyond him. He still attends the long meetings, the endless hours of plotting strategy, but only as an auxiliary. No one looks to him to speak, which is a relief, especially when tempers flare, the strain wearing them down the way a millstone grinds charcoal into a fuel that needs only a spark to ignite. 
Jiang Wanyin is just as ill-suited for the role, both deferential and belligerent, wearing his newfound authority like an ill-fitting cloak. 
He clashes with Wei Wuxian daily. It becomes a common occurrence to hear one or both of their voices rising, bouncing off the courtyard walls. Lan Wangji, if he’s in earshot, places himself nearby, in case Wei Wuxian should wish for an escape. It irks Jiang Wanyin, who’s regained his old habit of scowling at Lan Wangji for the mere fact of his existence, their uneasy truce collapsing. 
“He’s just worried,” Wei Wuxian says after one of their spats, sounding tired, sounding restless, falling into his old habit too of defending his brother. “Shijie says he’s not sleeping.”
“Are you?” Lan Wangji asks. 
“Ha! Me? Lan Zhan. I sleep *too much,* like a baby. You can’t even wake me in the mornings.”
It’s a lie, and a transparent one. Lan Wangji rises before dawn, and too often now he finds Wei Wuxian awake during those hours, prowling around on some errand or toying with notes on his flute. “Oh no,” Wei Wuxian says, whenever Lan Wangji appears in whatever tucked-away corner where he’s failed to hide himself. “Young Master Lan is here to scold me.”
Lan Wangji does not. He unwraps pancakes, or fruit, or stolen cakes from the kitchens, and sits down beside him, sharing the small meal in silence, usually while a rosy dawn breaks. He’s tamed wild rabbits; the principle is not all that different, with the right application of patience and rewards they eat out of his hands.
