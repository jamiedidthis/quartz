Seven days. Trapped in a cave. At the time, it doesn’t feel like those seven days could determine the course of his life, or Wei Wuxian’s. 

And yet. 

---- 

Lan Wangji wakes up to the sound of exertion. 

It has scarcely been a day; already he has learned that any sound in the cave is less alarming than silence. His leg keeps finding new ways to ache, which means he’s kept trying new ways to slip past the pain—dozing, mostly, outside of his habitual sleeping hours, or meditation so deep it might as well be unconsciousness. Wei Wuxian scolds him, saying how are they supposed to count the days if Lan Wangji sleeps at all hours, *so undisciplined, really,* and still it’s easy to slip in and out of consciousness, his body overtaxed and more broken than it has been in a while. 

That is one thing he’s woken up to, the scolding. There was also the snapping of twigs, Wei Wuxian yelping when he pinched a finger while feeding the fire. There was what first felt like silence—but turned out to be the faint sound of water, Wei Wuxian coming up out of the pool to bring back a new layer of robes that he would have to spread out and dry. 

The actual silence, in which Lan Wangji basked for a single, decadent moment before he opened his eyes, had been Wei Wuxian an inch from his face, feathering a maple leaf over Lan Wangji’s skin. Wei Wuxian yelled and fell backwards, and then scolded Lan Wangji for so long that, eventually, the scolding helped calm the way Lan Wangji’s heart was trying to pound out of his chest.

So, the sound of exertion: a welcome thing. It gives Lan Wangji time to greet the pain in his leg, and to gather himself for the sight that awaits him. 

Wei Wuxian, on the other side of the fire, carefully moves through sword drills, testing his injured shoulder. 

He’s wearing the red inner robe, half-dry and streaked with the same dirt and soot that streaks his hands and his face. The sword, salvaged from a fallen Wen soldier, has no spiritual power behind it; it’s different from the way he wields Suibian with effortless grace. But he is still—Lan Wangji has the strength to admit this—an exceptionally skilled swordsman, an elegance and intensity to his movements that is arresting to watch. There is a kind of grace, Lan Wangji thinks, that is no less striking for the effort. Wei Wuxian wipes the hair out of his eyes and goes through the same drills again, and again, finally sheathing the sword with a grin of boundless delight when he catches Lan Wangji watching him. 

“You’re awake!” he says, dropping down beside Lan Wangji to poke at the fire. “I’m getting better. My shoulder.” He exhibits this range of motion, then rubs at his chest, wincing slightly. “Not that it really hurts but it’s good to keep stretching it out, make sure it heals properly. Shijie would make me eat lots of protein if I was at home, so my stomach keeps growling. Have you ever had lung fung soup? No, I guess not. It’s a Yunmeng dish. Or pork rib and lotus root? Nobody makes it like shijie. I’d get injured just to have it, it’s that good.” He rubs his stomach with a look of distress and longing. “I don’t know what’s worse, to think about food or to not think about it. How’s your leg, with the medicine? I’ll be ready to fight Xuanwu like we planned when you’re ready.”

Lan Wangji has followed this stream of talk the way he follows most things out of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, with effort and partial success. “Mn,” he answers, to the one question he deems relevant.

“Good,” Wei Wuxian says sincerely. “It’s from Wen Qing, so I knew it would help. You’ll feel better, Lan Zhan, and then we’ll fight Xuanwu, and if I die you have to tell everyone how brave I was.” 

He’s teasing. He flashes a smile so brilliant and full of life it says *how could I ever die?*

Lan Wangji, knowing better than to argue, says, “Mn.”

“I want at least three songs written about me,” Wei Wuxian requests. “Make sure they mention my beauty, not just how strong and fearless I am. You don’t have to lie about it—I’m modest too. Just say I was half as beautiful as the Second Jade of Lan, that makes me twice as beautiful as anyone else.”

Lan Wangji, through much experience, knows a ploy when he sees one. He is being provoked, into a scowl or a scoff or—Wei Wuxian probably hopes—the elusive eye roll. He refuses to rise to the bait. 

“That’s why you can’t die first,” Wei Wuxian is saying. “I’m good at music, but you’re better. Okay?”

“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says, since the edge of his robe is dangling in the fire he’s just stoked. 

“Oh,” Wei Wuxian says, patting out the stray sparks, tucking the robe safely beneath him. He doesn’t say thanks, but he nods, and then he bends down to check on Lan Wangji’s leg in the newly bright light. 

---- 

Lan Wangji is learning this about himself: he has had enough of caves for a lifetime. 

Wei Wuxian, for all of his self-professed boredom, appears to share none of this sentiment. He explores the cave with enthusiasm, wandering off and returning to their circle of light, faithfully reporting each finding in exhaustive detail, at length, often already mid-sentence by the time he returns to Lan Wangji by the fire.

There is a shallow pool in this chamber. There are no signs of fish; there might be snakes, he’ll keep looking. There are definitely bats, which means the pool is not safe to drink—a fact he dwells on less than he does the squeaks and flaps of the little bats, so *cute,* Lan Zhan. 

There is plenty of firewood. There is no sign of an exit. The bodies are gone, which makes Lan Wangji’s eyes widen, even as Wei Wuxian decides this bodes well for them. If Xuanwu stuffs himself, he won’t need them as a meal. “I bet he’s just hungry, Lan Zhan. *You’d* be pissed off too if you’d gone hundreds of years without a good snack.” It’s only the second day of their fast, but this is close enough to the truth that Lan Wangji can’t dismiss it. 

This bodes well too: there *is* water. The Wen soldiers dropped flasks as they fled or fell, and Wei Wuxian gathers an armful, enough to last three or four days, more if they ration it strictly. There is medicine too—Wei Wuxian shakes him awake over that one, an incoherent story about a bottle that he’d lost and thought was gone but then finally found. Bleary, Lan Wangji accepts the two pills Wei Wuxian drops on his tongue, dutifully coughing them down with a sip of stale water. Wei Wuxian brushes his chin, then swallows one pill for himself. 

“—our cores,” Wei Wuxian is saying, something about the nourishment thereof. It’s not food, nor is it enough to fully quench the pain or the thirst, but after a while, Lan Wangji feels as if he could keep his eyes open for more than an hour at a time. The pain recedes slightly. It feels like pale spring sunlight inside him; not a surge of energy, but a glimmer—a hope.

“Knew Wen Qing could help us,” Wei Wuxian says happily, and performs another small miracle: for the first time in days, he closes his eyes and his mouth, allowing them both a few moments of rest. 

---- 

“Have you ever broken a bone? Before this time, I mean.”

Later that day, or the next. Time bleeds like the wound on Lan Wangji’s leg before it had clotted. Wei Wuxian claims to keep track, but then again he has claimed it would take only two days for rescue, forgetting their rescuers have no swords to maneuver. Or maybe he does remember, but won’t say anything, chastened from when he’d already stumbled over the fact that help won’t be forthcoming from Cloud Recesses. Perhaps they are both politely keeping up fictions. Lan Wangji, trying to discipline his mind away from worst-case scenarios, has found that to his dismay the constant chatter helps. 

“Mn,” he says, which Wei Wuxian interprets correctly as *no.*

“Really? Not ever?” He is lying on his back, one arm folded beneath his head, idly twirling a stick through his fingertips. “I have, lots. It’s not so bad, once you get used to it.”

Lan Wangji cannot conceive of *getting used to* the kind of pain in his leg. He bears it, he ignores it when necessary, but the pain touches a deep core of anger inside of him, something that cannot stand to suffer injustice. 

“I climbed lots of trees,” Wei Wuxian is explaining. “I’d sleep up there, then fall and break my arm. Once it was because Jiang Cheng threw me off a pier.”

Lan Wangji tries to conceive of that too, a brother who shows his affection with aggression. Picturing Xichen throwing him off a pier, he might as well picture Xichen cutting off his head. 

“I’ve gotten burned before too.” Wei Wuxian starts to hike up his skirt, then thinks better of it, dropping the fabric back down over, presumably, whatever scar lurks beneath. “I was old enough to know better, but shijie’s soup smelled so good, I tried to climb up to reach it and knocked the pot off the stove.”

*Old enough to know better should apply to everything that you do,* Lan Wangji refrains from saying. See, he can do politeness, and fictions. 

“Once,” he says, and then pauses.

Wei Wuxian, sometimes, knows when to wait out the pauses. He twirls the stick through a complicated series of loops, both of them watching his fingers. 

“Once,” Lan Wangji says again. “I slipped. With Bichen. I had only just begun training. It took weeks to heal.”

“Ooh, Lan Zhan.” Wei Wuxian flips over to face him, eyes bright with interest. “You do have scars.”

“No,” Lan Wangji says illogically. 

“No? It didn’t scar? Do you have secret medicines known only to the Lan?”

What Lan Wangji had meant was, *no, I won’t show you,* only to realize he hadn’t been asked. He blushes in the firelight that is too dim to show blushes.

“No,” he says again. 

“No secret medicines? Oh.” Wei Wuxian looks disappointed. Then he brightens. “That means you *do* have scars, though. You’re a man, Lan Zhan.”

*Manhood* does not constitute *scarring,* but Lan Wangji doesn’t feel like revisiting the headache of heroic gestures and pretty girls. “It was an accident,” he says in clipped tones. 

“Of course it was, but you don’t *tell* people that. You make up a good story. One where you’re brave and the hero.”

Lan Wangji tries to resist. He really does try to resist. “Like falling out of trees, or being thrown off a pier?”

Wei Wuxian’s face lights up the way only his face lights up when a worthy opponent bests him. “Ha!” he says. “Exactly. Or knocking pots off a stove.”

He is grinning, and waiting to see if Lan Wangji will join him. When he doesn’t, Wei Wuxian laughs, undaunted, and rolls back over to resume tossing the stick in the air. 

---- 

“It’s so boring. I’m so bored,” Wei Wuxian says for the third time that hour, as if this is Lan Wangji’s fault. 

The third day. Lan Wangji is reasonably sure of this, if only because of the hollow pains in his stomach, and the fact his leg can bear some weight. Wei Wuxian, sitting next to him, is tossing pebbles at a stick he’s stuck in the ground. He yawns hugely, then pouts when this too fails to get Lan Wangji’s attention.

“Lan Zhan,” he says. 

Lan Wangji, who has been trying to meditate—albeit with modifications, as his leg doesn’t allow for his preferred lotus pose—chooses the one response that is sure to provoke Wei Wuxian. Silence. 

“Lan Zhan?” A pebble clicks. “Lan Zhan.”

Lan Wangji waits for one more *Lan Zhan,* the one that stretches the last syllable into a whine, before he opens his eyes. 

“Do you do this a lot?” Wei Wuxian asks, indicating Lan Wangji’s state of interrupted serenity, as if this was the urgent question that just had to be asked. 

Lan Wangji looks at him. 

“You do, don’t you? Like for days at a time, by yourself?”

“Self-discipline is good for proper cultivation.”

Wei Wuxian screws up his face, disapproval mixed with contemplation. 

“Don’t you meditate?” Lan Wangji asks, afraid to hear the answer. 

“Of course. Once a day, usually. But lots of other things too. That’s not *all* I do.” A long pause, during which he tosses a pebble. “Don’t you get lonely?” 

Lan Wangji blinks. He had anticipated scorn, at the very least gentle teasing. Wei Wuxian looks at him, serious. 

“I’d get so lonely,” he says. He flicks another pebble with precision at the stick. “I like having people around, to do things. It doesn’t have to be much. Just to talk to, at least. Don’t you like someone to talk to, Lan Zhan?”

*No,* is the obvious and correct answer to that—the word sticks on his tongue, unable to make himself say it before Wei Wuxian continues. 

“It’s nice to have that, especially when you’re not used to silence all the time. Lotus Pier isn’t quiet, like Cloud Recesses. There’s always something to do. Swimming, or fishing. Picnics. Flying kites. What’s your favorite thing to do, just for fun? Do you like flying kites?” 

Lan Wangji watches a pebble skid wide. “I do sword drills,” he says. 

“That’s work, Lan Zhan. I said fun.”

“I read books.”

Wei Wuxian looks at him again.

“I *like* books,” Lan Wangji says. 

“Lan Zhan,” he says. “Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan.” Wei Wuxian cups his palm, passing him a handful of pebbles. “Of course *you’d* rather have *books* than swimming in rivers.”

Lan Wangji rolls a pebble on the pad of his thumb. He hesitates, then tosses it. It neatly taps the stick. “There are cold springs for bathing.”

Wei Wuxian doesn’t have to say *bathing* isn’t *swimming.* “If we were in Yunmeng, I’d take you to the river,” he says. “It’s so hot in the summer, you’d have to live in the water. You’d probably get sunburnt and the skin would peel off your nose, but I’d help you stay in the shade. We’d catch carp, with our bare hands. Have you ever done that, Lan Zhan? I’d cook them for you on the fire, just like this, and you could sleep in the grass while our clothes dried, tired out from all the times I chased you underwater.”

A pebble skitters, landing short. Lan Wangji selects another. 

“You’d like that, I know, even though you’d never say it. Then I’d be such a good friend, you could meditate for hours and read all the books we have at Lotus Pier.” 

Wei Wuxian bumps his shoulder. He smiles at him sideways as his pebble lands closer than Lan Wangji’s did. 

“I win, Lan Zhan,” he says, although there are no rules and no score and they haven’t really even been playing. He collects another handful of pebbles and starts over again. 

---- 

“*No,*” Lan Wangji snaps, pain clawing in every direction as he moves too abruptly, blindly shoving the tangled mess of black hair and red ribbon off of his lap. Wei Wuxian, bleary with sleep, recoils backwards, affronted.

“What the—? Lan Zhan!” 

“*No,*” Lan Wangji says with force. He is bleary with sleep too. And pain. And hunger. And anger. And helplessness. 

He has *possibly* overreacted. But Wei Wuxian in his lap, sound asleep, had not been a scenario he anticipated waking up to.

“The ground is so rocky. You *told* me to sleep,” Wei Wuxian says.

“Sleep. Over *there,*” Lan Wangji says, his usual economy of words reduced even more. 

Wei Wuxian looks at the designated stretch of rocky ground. “It’s not like I hurt you,” he grumbles. “You just sleep sitting there, anyway. I didn’t jostle your leg. It’s the other side. I was *careful.*” 

It is indeed the other side, which has also kept Lan Wangji closest to the fire, but they aren’t discussing these considerations.

“I thought you wouldn’t care,” Wei Wuxian goes on, exaggerating his contriteness for sympathy. He yawns. “I’m so *tired.*” 

Lan Wangji closes his eyes, then opens them quickly in case that encourages Wei Wuxian to put his head back in his lap. “You can’t—” he says.

Wei Wuxian waits. 

“You can’t just—”

Wei Wuxian yawns again, not putting it on this time. “I didn’t think you would care,” he repeats more seriously, which has to be the biggest lie he has told in recent memory. Of course Lan Wangji always *cares* about being touched, or hauled around, or having his ribbon stripped off and tied around other limbs. Wei Wuxian knows these things and does them anyway, and it’s been a long time since Lan Wangji has done anything but allow it.

Wei Wuxian retreats, taking the outer robe he had draped across Lan Wangji and pointedly crumpling it into a pillow to stuff under his head, well out of reach, on the other side of the fire. He glares at Lan Wangji, laying his head down with a sigh of long-suffering. 

Lan Wangji leans back, closing his eyes, willing his heartbeat to subside to a reasonable pace. Pain stabs him like a knife, his leg throbbing. He counts through a few breaths, trying to release the worst of the ache, along with the tension that is laced in tight knots through his shoulders. 

His mind proves harder to quiet. He is unable to sweep his thoughts away, make his mind a blank slate. Reason creeps back in, as does logic. As does a not-insubstantial amount of shame. The fire crackles calmly, and it’s with dread curling in the pit of his stomach that he finally says, “Wei Ying.”

Wei Wuxian is not sleeping. He continues pretending he is. Lan Wangji could do that too, accept the excuse with gratitude and face it all again in the… whatever passes for morning in the dark underground. 

“Wei Ying.”

Wei Wuxian stirs, performatively sulking a little. 

Lan Wangji says it a third time, “Wei Ying,” and Wei Wuxian cracks an eye open in his direction. 

Lan Wangji sighs. He is not going to make this easy. Or maybe he is, because then Wei Wuxian says, after the silence goes on too long, “What, Lan Zhan? Is that you saying, ‘sorry, Wei Ying, I was being ridiculous’?”

Lan Wangji nods, once. It’s Wei Wuxian’s turn to sigh. 

“Fine. Whatever. It’s okay.”

Somehow that makes it worse, this pit of dread and shame writhing in Lan Wangji’s belly. It’s not okay. It never has been. “I—” There are words that won’t form, a whole language that has never been at home on his tongue. That might not even exist. “I don’t—”

Wei Wuxian rolls onto his belly, propping up on his elbows, his hair falling out of its ribbon and over his shoulders. “I didn’t mean to freak you out, okay? I mean, lots of times I do. It’s fun to tease you. Need Lan Zhan to cough up blood? I’ll get naked! I *thought,* though, that it was maybe because you actually… you know, you’d thought about it so that’s why it…” Maybe there are words that fail Wei Wuxian too. He clears his throat, cheeks pink, and tries again. “You know, how there are things you’ve decided you can’t have because you’re ridiculous and a Lan but you like it when I make you do them anyway. Like eat sweets. Or miss curfew. Or…”

*Kiss you,* Lan Wangji thinks. A knot is lodged in his throat. It’s the closest they’ve come to acknowledging that happened.

Wei Wuxian is going valiantly on. “—wouldn’t ever if you didn’t really want me to, though. I thought you did, is all. But if you don’t…”

Lan Wangji swallows. He nods before Wei Wuxian can finish the sentence. Before he can realize he’s nodding and stop himself. 

Wei Wuxian falters, face on the verge of falling. “You don’t?” 

No. No, he meant—yes. He meant that Wei Wuxian is right. Yes to all of it. He wants it all, and he wants the plausible deniability of pretending he does not want, and perhaps it has reached the point where he can no longer have both. He closes his eyes, tired and hungry and miserable enough to admit which one he would rather give up. “Yes,” he says, making his throat form the word. 

“Yes, what?”

“Yes I do. Want that. I…”

The admission almost chokes him, even with no one else around for miles. There is a long dreaded silence. Only because it is so long does he hear the slight scraping of pebbles, someone trying to move quietly in the dark. He opens his eyes, and Wei Wuxian is there. He has crawled over quietly, helpfully. Uncertainly. The sulk has fallen off his face; he looks as vulnerable now as Lan Wangji has ever seen him. 

Lan Wangji’s heart feels like a bruise, raw and tender in his chest. He had thought he was the only one who felt desperately vulnerable. Wei Wuxian doesn’t fear anything. Wei Wuxian fights dire owls and demon tortoises; he taunts Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu with merry exuberance. The look on his face says that Wei Wuxian fears this.

Lan Wangji does not move a muscle, which makes Wei Wuxian tentatively respond to that welcome, crawling down and resting his head cautiously on Lan Wangji’s lap. 

The panic still flaps in his chest, the same as when Wei Wuxian says things like *I’ll carry you* or starts stripping off clothing. It flaps, but then it—settles. Touch, the thing he’s been so frightened of, does not obliterate him after all. Light as a bird that is still fledging its feathers, he rests his hand on Wei Wuxian’s head.

Wei Wuxian peeks up. “Lan Zhan, do not throw up on my head.”

In reply, Lan Wangji digs his fingers into his hair and tugs sharply. 

Wei Wuxian gasps, then snuggles down, apparently reassured of his welcome. When Lan Wangji politely removes his hand, Wei Wuxian politely places it back. Unaccustomed to this, Lan Wangji haltingly strokes the tangled mass of his hair. Then he strokes it again. It is silk, and he idly and carefully begins to unknot it, combing his fingers down through the long length, allowed to have this, a gift received more than given. 

Wei Wuxian almost purrs, drowsy with contentment. Lan Wangji’s mind snags on that, flooded suddenly with a memory nearly a decade old. He couldn’t have been more than eight; they kept a sleek gray mouser in the kitchens, and he was the first to discover the litter of kittens she had birthed in secret. It’s a sense memory, rare and precious, his little heart bursting with wonder over a lap full of tiny, warm, wriggling things, falling all over themselves to let him pet and cuddle them for hours on end.

He had been punished for that, discovered when he never heard the bell calling him to the evening meal. He was pulled to his feet, marched back to the dormitories, harshly scolded for lack of discipline, and for weeks he had searched through every nook, cranny and bolt-hole he could find in Cloud Recesses but the kittens were never seen again. 

Wei Wuxian, in his lap, has turned his head up to look at him. Lan Wangji’s hand has gone still; Wei Wuxian is checking, uncertain again, to see if the permission has been revoked. 

Lan Wangji resumes stroking his scalp, unsnarling a strand of hair from the red ribbon. Satisfied, Wei Wuxian settles back down, closing his eyes and allowing himself to drift back towards sleep. 

---- 

“I like your cold springs cave better,” Wei Wuxian decides, the fourth day. “Lan Yi was nice, and it was beautiful, and there were bunnies to play with.”

The steady chill, the stale air, has made Wei Wuxian overcompensate with the fire. He’s built it up too high, and they’re enduring it, sweating through their robes. Even so, it is a preposterous statement—and one Lan Wangji is willing to allow for the sake of distraction.

“Mn,” he says, neutrally enough that Wei Wuxian will not be able to easily discern whether it means yes or no.

Wei Wuxian lifts up his hair, piling it on top of his head, leaning back against the wall. A bead of sweat slides down his neck. “Winter. Cloud Recesses. Lan Zhan. Tell me stories.”

Lan Wangji can feel the sweat prickling his scalp, pooling on his spine. He makes himself look sharply away from Wei Wuxian’s glistening neck.

“Lan Zhan. Winter. Cloud Recesses,” Wei Wuxian repeats like snapping his fingers to get his attention. He closes his eyes and sighs dreamily. “There must be so much snow.”

Lan Wangji is worn out enough, his defenses down enough, that *snow* twists in his heart, another lingering sense-memory that should have faded long before now. “There is snow,” he agrees.

“And it’s beautiful.” 

“It’s very beautiful.”

Wei Wuxian hums appreciatively. “Have you been in the cold springs when it’s winter?”

He has been in the cold springs in every type of weather imaginable. He has been when snow drops on the surface, when the air is so bone-chilling that his teeth clack uncontrollably, so cold the water’s almost warm, his senses all confused. He has followed cold down through the very concept of cold, down through pain, out to some heady precipice where it just feels effervescent and numbing. It’s like… he’s not exactly sure what it’s like. He once sat down with ink, brush, and paper, tried to put it in a poem, and failed.

He tells Wei Wuxian the first part, the way the snow touches the water and doesn’t immediately melt.

“You’d *have* to get naked then,” Wei Wuxian muses, almost to himself. “If you got out in wet robes you’d freeze to death on the spot before you could get dry or warm.” 

So then there’s heat now, more of it, just when Lan Wangji had almost conjured the mental sensation of cold. He can feel his skin, livid. He is tired and filthy and it’s not too dramatic to say he is dying of hunger—this should not be difficult.

“Lan Zhan, *do* you get naked?”

“Wei Ying,” he tries to say sharply. Instead, he sounds a little hoarse. 

Wei Wuxian says nothing, which is so unprecedented that Lan Wangji makes the fatal mistake of opening his eyes to look.

Wei Wuxian is smiling. He is lounging back against the rock, one arm on his head, a pile of inky hair slipping down his neck, looking like a picture in a book that Lan Wangji should not know exists. He is watching Lan Wangji, and smiling. Not even wickedly. Just a smile that is lovely and knowing, that could make a man walk off a cliff and fall to his death.

“*Wei Ying,*” Wei Wuxian growls softly, imitating Lan Wangji’s voice. 

“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says, since that seems to be all he can say.

Wei Wuxian’s face changes. He reads Lan Wangji’s face, finds something there that makes the knowing drop away, the pure loveliness remain. Lan Wangji’s breath catches in his throat. The moment stretches out like honey pulled out of its comb, their gazes locked, the blazing heat on his face and the crackling glow of the fire.

Which one of them tips forward first, he doesn’t know. All he knows is that Wei Wuxian meets him, already there when Lan Wangji lays their faces together and touches his lips with the dry, burning heat of his own.

Wei Wuxian kisses him back, a *rightness* about it that threads down his spine. It’s a shiver, in the heat. 

They don’t pull apart; the kiss ends, and they stay, lips close, breath mingling. So close that it doesn’t take anything, Wei Wuxian’s fingers sliding around the back of his neck, to bring him back in. 

Lan Wangji has not had a drop of liquor this time. His head swims with it anyway, the soft press and drag of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, lips chapped from days of rationing water. He is dizzy with the knowledge that he can have this again, dizzy with the slightly clumsy way Wei Wuxian is pressing against him. Dizzy with the way he’s kissing Wei Wuxian back. Clumsy too, so full of need, heart pounding so hard it aches in his skull. His stomach clenches with pleasure. Wei Wuxian hisses softly like hot stones hitting water. 

Lan Wangji’s hand has slid down over his chest, where it hurts, where the brand is. He pulls it back, stricken. 

Wincing, Wei Wuxian rubs at the wound, then shakes his head, leans back in.

This time it is the sharp intake of Lan Wangji’s breath that stops them, pain searing down through his leg when Wei Wuxian brushes against it. “Sorry, Lan Zhan,” he whispers, sucking in air through his teeth, wincing on his behalf.

The reality of their circumstances is demanding attention. There is nothing ideal about it—they are hot, cramped, trapped, exhausted, lightheaded from hunger, in pain. They bump noses, adjust their weight, shift position, try again. And then Wei Wuxian is pulling back, letting his hands drop away without Lan Wangji’s permission.

It is like before, the kiss pulling out like the tide, leaving Lan Wangji on the shore. To clutch at it is to have it slide through his fingers like water. 

At least this time there is no pledge to never speak of it again. Wei Wuxian sits back, still close enough for their sleeves to brush. He picks a piece of ash off Lan Wangji’s robe, then smoothes a wrinkle, fussy little touches that don’t help calm the racing of Lan Wangji’s heart. And then Lan Wangji is looking up because he’s gotten to his feet. 

“I should—” Wei Wuxian says, and trails off. He gestures instead, a vague flop of his arm, disappearing into the darkness before Lan Wangji can make his tongue form the words, *come back.*

---- 

Later, by the fire. Wei Wuxian sits beside him, running his dark outer robe through his hands, holding it at various angles for the crackling fire to dry. 

It is small now, the fire, died back to reasonable proportions. Wei Wuxian has brought back the robe dripping wet from the pond, his own face freshly scrubbed, letting Lan Wangji wash the soot and sweat off his skin. Tomorrow, he will don it again, along with the belt and vambraces, and they will fight a monster. 

That accounts partially for the mood by the fire. They cannot keep waiting for rescue. Now is the last, best chance they have. Lan Wangji’s leg can bear more weight than yesterday; if they wait longer, they’ll be weaker. Together they share the nightly ration of water, swallow the last of the medicine. The little burst of spring sunshine arrives, fainter now, but still there.

“Wei Ying,” he says, when he can stand it no longer. 

Wei Wuxian, lost in thought, looks up and blinks in Lan Wangji’s direction. “Hmm?”

“I—” Lan Wangji says. 

Wei Wuxian folds the robe up, discarding it, and shifts around to face him, crossing his arms on his knees. Lan Wangji’s thoughts scatter like pebbles. 

“What?” Wei Wuxian prompts him, after a moment. “Oh no. Lan Zhan. Is this where you tell me you’re sorry? Say how much you like Mianmian?”

It’s a tease, like the first time. Wei Wuxian drawing him out, never as careless or oblivious as he lets on, but he says it a little bit recklessly, as if nerves get the better of him despite trying to hide it.

“No,” Lan Wangji says. 

“You *are* going to say sorry. That’s your sorry voice.”

“No.”  

He is not going to say that. It twists in his gut, like the way his hands twist in his robes, how un-sorry he is. But—there is something, Wei Wuxian is not completely wrong. 

“I never—I have only—” Lan Wangji swallows. He can do this. “If I did something badly, it would be helpful to know.” He announces it to the fire, his palms damp where his fists rest on his knees.

Once again, though, he finds himself looking over when Wei Wuxian doesn’t answer. 

“How would *I* know?” Wei Wuxian asks him sincerely. “Lan Zhan. How many people do you think I have kissed?”

Lan Wangji was not expecting that question. He tries to think, safely. “…Many?”

Wei Wuxian’s smile is slow-blooming and lazy and utterly provocative. “One,” he says. 

“One…?”

“*You,*” he says, in case Lan Wangji is slow. “So I’m flattered I am so obviously excellent at it that I must have kissed hundreds of people, Lan Zhan, but alas, I am naturally gifted, only you, I have been perfectly virtuous, saving myself for—ow!”

It feels wonderful to throw a handful of stones at him. Only once before has Lan Wangji given into that physical impulse—in the library, tearing an explicit book to shreds in his hands. It helps him rebalance, calm the head-spin from *one, you, only you.*

“So if you would like to do it again—”

“Yes.”

Wei Wuxian halts mid-sentence. It is wonderful too, to throw him so badly. Even if Lan Wangji blurted the word before he could think. 

“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says.

“Yes.” Lan Wangji nods.

“You want to—”

Nods.

“Here?”

Nods.

“But your leg?”

“Is not falling off.” There are limits to Lan Wangji’s patience. 

Wei Wuxian gulps, bravado slipping. Lan Wangji, committed to this path of destruction, watches the slide of his throat. 

“Now?” he says again. 

Lan Wangji, sometimes, is forced to take initiative. He can’t exactly rise up on his knees; instead, he drags Wei Wuxian over by the front of his robe into the full force of his kiss. 

Wei Wuxian kind of—*mmumphs.* They collide. It does jar his leg, but Lan Wangji is briefly beyond caring. He does not let Wei Wuxian go; when he finally pulls back, Wei Wuxian stares at him, eyes huge, then coughs and breaks into laughter that sheds more warmth than the fire. 

“Lan Zhan!” he exclaims, scandalized, and pushes their mouths back together with no finesse whatsoever. He is half in Lan Wangji’s lap before good sense arrives and he darts backwards enough to avoid Lan Wangji’s leg. 

“No,” Lan Wangji says irrationally, not releasing his grip on the front of Wei Wuxian’s robe. 

Wei Wuxian pats his hand gently, prying his fingers loose. “I have an idea,” he assures him, which has never *not* struck fear in Lan Wangji’s heart. Before he knows how to accommodate this turn of events, Wei Wuxian has climbed across him, dropping over to his good side. He taps Lan Wangji’s knee, the one that does not make his head spin in agony. “Lan Zhan. Open your legs.”

At Lan Wangji’s look, he rolls his eyes so dramatically they might fall out of his head. 

“So I don’t hurt the bad one,” he says. 

Oh. Lan Wangji… obeys. Wei Wuxian straddles his good leg, perching there, one knee between them, keeping most of his weight off of Lan Wangji’s thigh.

“How’s this?” he asks. “Hurts?”

Lan Wangji checks. He shakes his head no. 

“Good,” Wei Wuxian says. He licks his lips, surveying the options for his next course of action. He settles down a bit more, so they’re mostly face to face, resting his hands on Lan Wangji’s shoulders. Then he frowns, taking Lan Wangji’s empty hands, placing one on the back of his neck, the other safely at his waist, out of reach of the still-tender brand. “All right?”

*No.* Very much *not all right.* Very much *not ever going to be all right again.* 

Lan Wangji jerks his head in a nod. 

The smile returns, the one from before, the slow-blooming one, full of delight and lazy provocation. Wei Wuxian’s hands come back to rest on Lan Wangji’s shoulders. He leans in, close enough that his breath ghosts over his lips. “Lan Zhan?”

Lan Wangji, staring at the way Wei Wuxian’s mouth glistens, red as a berry, says, “Mn?”

“Kiss me.”

Lan Wangji finds his hands are shaking. This is… real, without the plausible deniability of impulse or frustration or even the helpful pretext of inebriation. He can’t help it, he freezes, too much to process at once, and if he does this wrong— 

Wei Wuxian huffs fondly, tips his face up and kisses him. 

It’s a *kiss.* Slow and real, and intent, not the clumsy crushing of mouths he had attempted. Lan Wangji’s grip tightens, fingers digging into his waist, into the nape of his neck. Wei Wuxian gasps softly. Heat that is not from the fire curls up Lan Wangji’s spine. 

Wei Wuxian, when they part, brushes his thumb across Lan Wangji’s cheek. “Ahh. Lan Zhan *does* blush,” he whispers, and more heat, more color floods beneath Lan Wangji’s skin. Grinning, Wei Wuxian bumps him with his nose. He kisses him there, then next to his ear, experimenting. “*You* wanted this, Lan Zhan,” he reminds him, dropping down to nuzzle his neck, a tender spot that sends a flurry of sparks cascading down through his body. 

Lan Wangji is going to combust. He will not get to fight a demon tortoise; he will be a pile of ash on the ground long before rescue comes. He makes a strangled sound in his throat—Wei Wuxian rewards it with laughter, a puff of air that chases shivers up and down Lan Wangji’s skin. 

“Wei Ying,” he croaks. 

“Mm?”

His protest dies a swift death on his tongue. It was reflex anyway, the habit of protesting anything Wei Wuxian does—useless when he would let Wei Wuxian do anything, as long as *anything* involves the delicate swirl of his tongue just below Lan Wangji’s ear. It feels exquisite. It’s mortifying. He makes another pained and very undignified sound, and Wei Wuxian detaches abruptly to look at his face.

“Lan Zhan, is that weird? If it’s weird, you can—”

Oh, for— In exasperation, Lan Wangji pulls Wei Wuxian back down to his mouth. Laughter spills out between them. Wei Wuxian’s laughter, his mouth falling open until the tip of Lan Wangji’s tongue brushes the tip of his own and his laughter chokes off into a soft, startled sound. 

It’s instinct, that’s all. It’s not knowledge or skill; just instinct that brings their mouths back together, deliberate this time as they both take a breath, Wei Wuxian’s eyes falling closed as Lan Wangji opens up and lets him all the way in. 

They both make a sound when their tongues touch. Heat floods odd places on Lan Wangji’s body—the inside of his elbows, his thighs, the top of his scalp.
