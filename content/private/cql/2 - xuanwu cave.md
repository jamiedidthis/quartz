Seven days. Trapped in a cave. At the time, it doesn’t feel like those seven days could determine the course of his life, or Wei Wuxian’s. 

And yet. 

---- 

Lan Wangji wakes up to the sound of exertion. 

It has scarcely been a day; already he has learned that any sound in the cave is less alarming than silence. His leg keeps finding new ways to ache, which means he’s kept trying new ways to slip past the pain—dozing, mostly, outside of his habitual sleeping hours, or meditation so deep it might as well be unconsciousness. Wei Wuxian scolds him, saying how are they supposed to count the days if Lan Wangji sleeps at all hours, *so undisciplined, really,* and still it’s easy to slip in and out of consciousness, his body overtaxed and more broken than it has been in a while. 

That is one thing he’s woken up to, the scolding. There was also the snapping of twigs, Wei Wuxian yelping when he pinched a finger while feeding the fire. There was what first felt like silence—but turned out to be the faint sound of water, Wei Wuxian coming up out of the pool to bring back a new layer of robes that he would have to spread out and dry. 

The actual silence, in which Lan Wangji basked for a single, decadent moment before he opened his eyes, had been Wei Wuxian an inch from his face, feathering a maple leaf over Lan Wangji’s skin. Wei Wuxian yelled and fell backwards, and then scolded Lan Wangji for so long that, eventually, the scolding helped calm the way Lan Wangji’s heart was trying to pound out of his chest.

So, the sound of exertion: a welcome thing. It gives Lan Wangji time to greet the pain in his leg, and to gather himself for the sight that awaits him. 

Wei Wuxian, on the other side of the fire, carefully moves through sword drills, testing his injured shoulder. 

He’s wearing the red inner robe, half-dry and streaked with the same dirt and soot that streaks his hands and his face. The sword, salvaged from a fallen Wen soldier, has no spiritual power behind it; it’s different from the way he wields Suibian with effortless grace. But he is still—Lan Wangji has the strength to admit this—an exceptionally skilled swordsman, an elegance and intensity to his movements that is arresting to watch. There is a kind of grace, Lan Wangji thinks, that is no less striking for the effort. Wei Wuxian wipes the hair out of his eyes and goes through the same drills again, and again, finally sheathing the sword with a grin of boundless delight when he catches Lan Wangji watching him. 

“You’re awake!” he says, dropping down beside Lan Wangji to poke at the fire. “I’m getting better. My shoulder.” He exhibits this range of motion, then rubs at his chest, wincing slightly. “Not that it really hurts but it’s good to keep stretching it out, make sure it heals properly. Shijie would make me eat lots of protein if I was at home, so my stomach keeps growling. Have you ever had lung fung soup? No, I guess not. It’s a Yunmeng dish. Or pork rib and lotus root? Nobody makes it like shijie. I’d get injured just to have it, it’s that good.” He rubs his stomach with a look of distress and longing. “I don’t know what’s worse, to think about food or to not think about it. How’s your leg, with the medicine? I’ll be ready to fight Xuanwu like we planned when you’re ready.”

Lan Wangji has followed this stream of talk the way he follows most things out of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, with effort and partial success. “Mn,” he answers, to the one question he deems relevant.

“Good,” Wei Wuxian says sincerely. “It’s from Wen Qing, so I knew it would help. You’ll feel better, Lan Zhan, and then we’ll fight Xuanwu, and if I die you have to tell everyone how brave I was.” 

He’s teasing. He flashes a smile so brilliant and full of life it says *how could I ever die?*

Lan Wangji, knowing better than to argue, says, “Mn.”

“I want at least three songs written about me,” Wei Wuxian requests. “Make sure they mention my beauty, not just how strong and fearless I am. You don’t have to lie about it—I’m modest too. Just say I was half as beautiful as the Second Jade of Lan, that makes me twice as beautiful as anyone else.”

Lan Wangji, through much experience, knows a ploy when he sees one. He is being provoked, into a scowl or a scoff or—Wei Wuxian probably hopes—the elusive eye roll. He refuses to rise to the bait. 

“That’s why you can’t die first,” Wei Wuxian is saying. “I’m good at music, but you’re better. Okay?”

“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says, since the edge of his robe is dangling in the fire he’s just stoked. 

“Oh,” Wei Wuxian says, patting out the stray sparks, tucking the robe safely beneath him. He doesn’t say thanks, but he nods, and then he bends down to check on Lan Wangji’s leg in the newly bright light. 

---- 

Lan Wangji is learning this about himself: he has had enough of caves for a lifetime. 

Wei Wuxian, for all of his self-professed boredom, appears to share none of this sentiment. He explores the cave with enthusiasm, wandering off and returning to their circle of light, faithfully reporting each finding in exhaustive detail, at length, often already mid-sentence by the time he returns to Lan Wangji by the fire.

There is a shallow pool in this chamber. There are no signs of fish; there might be snakes, he’ll keep looking. There are definitely bats, which means the water is not safe to drink—a fact he dwells on less than he does the squeaks and flaps of the little bats, so *cute,* Lan Zhan. 

There is plenty of firewood. There is no sign of an exit. The bodies are gone, which makes Lan Wangji’s eyes widen, even as Wei Wuxian decides this bodes well for them. If Xuanwu stuffs himself, he won’t need them as a meal. “I bet he’s just hungry, Lan Zhan. *You’d* be pissed off too if you’d gone hundreds of years without a good snack.” It’s only the second day of their fast, but this is close enough to the truth that Lan Wangji can’t dismiss it. 

This bodes well too: there *is* water. The Wen soldiers dropped flasks as they fled or fell, and Wei Wuxian gathers an armful, enough to last three or four days, more if they ration it strictly. There is medicine too—Wei Wuxian shakes him awake over that one, an incoherent story about a bottle that he’d lost and thought was gone but then finally found. Blearily, Lan Wangji accepts the two pills Wei Wuxian drops on his tongue, dutifully coughing them down with a sip of stale water. Wei Wuxian brushes his chin, then swallows one pill for himself. 

“—our cores,” Wei Wuxian is saying, something about the nourishment thereof. It’s not food, nor is it enough to fully quench the pain or the thirst, but after a while, Lan Wangji feels as if he could keep his eyes open for more than an hour at a time. The pain recedes slightly. It feels like pale spring sunlight inside him; not a surge of energy, but a glimmer—a hope.

“Knew Wen Qing could help us,” Wei Wuxian says happily, and performs another small miracle: for the first time in two days, he closes his eyes and his mouth, allowing them both a few moments of rest. 

---- 

“Have you ever broken a bone? Before this time, I mean.”

Later that day, or the next. Time bleeds like the wound on Lan Wangji’s leg before it had clotted. Wei Wuxian claims to keep track, but then again he has claimed it would take only two days for rescue, forgetting their rescuers have no swords to maneuver. Or maybe he does remember, but won’t say anything, chastened from when he’d already stumbled over the fact that help won’t be forthcoming from Cloud Recesses. Perhaps they are both politely keeping up fictions. Lan Wangji, trying to discipline his mind away from worst-case scenarios, has found that to his dismay the constant chatter helps. 

“Mn,” he says, which Wei Wuxian interprets correctly as *no.*

“Really? Not ever?” He is lying on his back, one arm folded beneath his head, idly twirling a stick through his fingertips. “I have, lots. It’s not so bad, once you get used to it.”

Lan Wangji cannot conceive of *getting used to* the kind of pain in his leg. He bears it, he ignores it when necessary, but the pain touches a deep core of anger inside him, something that cannot stand to suffer injustice. 

“I climbed lots of trees,” Wei Wuxian is explaining. “I’d sleep up there, then fall and break my arm. Once it was because Jiang Cheng threw me off a pier.”

Lan Wangji tries to conceive of that too, a brother who shows his affection with aggression. Picturing Lan Xichen throwing him off a pier, he might as well picture Lan Xichen cutting off his head. 

“I’ve gotten burned before too.” Wei Wuxian starts to hike up his skirt, then thinks better of it, dropping the fabric back down over, presumably, whatever scar lurks beneath. “I was old enough to know better, but shijie’s soup smelled so good, I tried to climb up to reach it and knocked the pot off the stove.”

*Old enough to know better should apply to everything that you do,* Lan Wangji refrains from saying. See, he can do politeness, and fictions. 

“Once,” he says, and then pauses.

Wei Wuxian, sometimes, knows when to wait out the pauses. He twirls the stick through a complicated series of loops, both of them watching his fingers. 

“Once,” Lan Wangji says again. “I slipped. With Bichen. I had only just begun training. It took weeks to heal.”

“Ooh, Lan Zhan.” Wei Wuxian flips over to face him, eyes bright with interest. “You do have scars.”

“No,” Lan Wangji says illogically. 

“No? It didn’t scar? Do you have secret medicines known only to the Lan?”

What Lan Wangji had meant was, *no, I won’t show you,* only to realize he hadn’t been asked. He blushes in the firelight that is too dim to show blushes.

“No,” he says again. 

“No secret medicines? Oh.” Wei Wuxian looks disappointed. Then he brightens. “That means you *do* have scars, though. You’re a man, Lan Zhan.”

*Manhood* does not constitute *scarring,* but Lan Wangji doesn’t feel like revisiting the headache of heroic gestures and pretty girls. “It was an accident,” he says in clipped tones. 

“Of course it was, but you don’t *tell* people that. You make up a good story. One where you’re brave and the hero.”

Lan Wangji tries to resist. He really does try to resist. “Like falling out of trees, or being thrown off a pier?”

Wei Wuxian’s face lights up the way only his face lights up when a worthy opponent bests him. “Ha!” he says. “Exactly. Or knocking pots off a stove.”

He is grinning, and waiting to see if Lan Wangji will join him. When he doesn’t, Wei Wuxian laughs, undaunted, and rolls back over to resume tossing the stick in the air. 

---- 

“It’s so boring. I’m so bored,” Wei Wuxian says for the third time that hour, as if this is Lan Wangji’s fault. 

The third day. Lan Wangji is reasonably sure of this, if only because of the hollow pains in his stomach, and the fact his leg can bear some weight. Wei Wuxian, sitting next to him, is tossing pebbles at a stick he’s stuck in the ground. He slumps halfway over, then pouts when this too fails to get Lan Wangji’s attention.

“Lan Zhan,” he says. 

Lan Wangji, who has been trying to meditate—albeit with modifications, as his leg doesn’t allow for his preferred lotus pose—chooses the one response that is sure to provoke Wei Wuxian. Silence. 

“Lan Zhan?” A pebble clicks. “Lan Zhan.”

Lan Wangji waits for one more *Lan Zhan,* the one that stretches the last syllable into a whine, before he opens his eyes. 

“Do you do this a lot?” Wei Wuxian asks, indicating Lan Wangji’s state of interrupted serenity, as if this was the urgent question that just had to be asked. 

Lan Wangji looks at him. 

“You do, don’t you? Like for days at a time, by yourself?”

“Self-discipline is good for proper cultivation.”

Wei Wuxian screws up his face, disapproval mixed with contemplation. 

“Don’t you meditate?” Lan Wangji asks, afraid to hear the answer. 

“Of course. Once a day, usually. But lots of other things too. That’s not *all* I do.” A long pause, during which he tosses a pebble. “Don’t you get lonely?” 

Lan Wangji blinks. He had anticipated scorn, at the very least gentle teasing. Wei Wuxian looks at him, serious. 

“I’d get so lonely,” he says. He flicks another pebble with precision at the stick. “I like having people around, to do things. It doesn’t have to be much. Just to talk to, at least. Don’t you like someone to talk to, Lan Zhan?”

*No,* is the obvious and correct answer to that—the word sticks on his tongue, Lan Wangji unable to make himself say it before Wei Wuxian continues. 

“It’s nice to have that, especially when you’re not used to silence all the time. Lotus Pier isn’t quiet, like Cloud Recesses. There’s always something to do. Swimming, or fishing. Picnics. Flying kites. What’s your favorite thing to do, just for fun? Do you like flying kites?” 

Lan Wangji watches a pebble skid wide. “I do sword drills,” he says. 

“That’s work, Lan Zhan. I said fun.”

“I read books.”

Wei Wuxian looks at him again.

“I *like* books,” Lan Wangji says. 

“Lan Zhan,” he says. “Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan.” Wei Wuxian cups his palm, passing him a handful of pebbles. “Of course *you’d* rather have *books* than swimming in rivers.”

Lan Wangji rolls a pebble on the pad of his thumb. He hesitates, then tosses it. It neatly taps the stick. “There are cold springs for bathing.”

Wei Wuxian doesn’t have to say *bathing* isn’t *swimming.* “If we were in Yunmeng, I’d take you to the river,” he says. “It’s so hot in the summer, you’d have to live in the water. You’d probably get sunburnt and the skin would peel off your nose, but I’d help you stay in the shade. We’d catch carp, with our bare hands. Have you ever done that, Lan Zhan? I’d cook them for you on the fire, just like this, and you could sleep in the grass while our clothes dried, tired out from all the times I chased you underwater.”

A pebble skitters, landing short. Lan Wangji selects another. 

“You’d like that, I know, even though you’d never say it. Then I’d be such a good friend, you could meditate for hours and read all the books we have at Lotus Pier.” 

Wei Wuxian bumps his shoulder. He smiles at him sideways as his pebble lands closer than Lan Wangji’s did. 

“I win, Lan Zhan,” he says, although there are no rules and no score and they haven’t really even been playing. He collects another handful of pebbles and starts over again. 

---- 

“*No,*” Lan Wangji snaps, pain clawing in every direction as he moves too abruptly, blindly shoving the tangled mess of black hair and red ribbon off of his lap. Wei Wuxian, bleary with sleep, recoils backwards, affronted.

“What the—? Lan Zhan!” 

“*No,*” Lan Wangji says with force. He is bleary with sleep too. And pain. And anger. And helplessness. 

He has *possibly* overreacted. But Wei Wuxian in his lap, sound asleep, had not been a scenario he anticipated waking up to.

“The ground is so rocky. You *told* me to sleep,” Wei Wuxian says.

“Sleep. Over *there,*” Lan Wangji says, his usual economy of words reduced even more. 

Wei Wuxian looks at the designated stretch of rocky ground. “It’s not like I hurt you,” he grumbles. “You just sleep sitting there, anyway. I didn’t jostle your leg. It’s the other side. I was *careful.*” 

It is indeed the other side, which has also kept Lan Wangji closest to the fire, but they aren’t discussing these considerations.

“I thought you wouldn’t care,” Wei Wuxian goes on, exaggerating his contriteness for sympathy. He yawns. “I’m so *tired.*” 

Lan Wangji closes his eyes, then opens them quickly in case that encourages Wei Wuxian to put his head back in his lap. “You can’t—” he says.

Wei Wuxian waits. 

“You can’t just—”

Wei Wuxian yawns again, not putting it on this time. “I didn’t think you would care,” he repeats more seriously, which has to be the biggest lie he has told in recent memory. Of course Lan Wangji always *cares* about being touched, or hauled around, or having his ribbon stripped off and tied around other limbs. Wei Wuxian knows these things and does them anyway, and it’s been a long time since Lan Wangji has done anything but allow it.

Wei Wuxian retreats, taking the outer robe he had draped across Lan Wangji and pointedly crumpling it into a pillow to stuff under his head, well out of reach, on the other side of the fire. He glares at Lan Wangji, laying his head down with a sigh of long-suffering. 

Lan Wangji leans back, closing his eyes, willing his heartbeat to subside to a reasonable pace. Pain stabs him like a knife, his leg throbbing. He counts through a few breaths, trying to release the worst of the ache, along with the tension that is laced in tight knots through his shoulders.

His mind proves harder to quiet. He is unable to sweep his thoughts away, make his mind a blank slate. Self-awareness creeps back in, as does reason. As does a not-insubstantial amount of shame. The fire crackles calmly, and it’s with dread curling in the pit of his stomach that he finally says, “Wei Ying.”

Wei Wuxian is not sleeping. He continues pretending he is. Lan Wangji could do that too, accept the excuse with gratitude and face it all again in the… whatever passes for morning in the dark underground. 

“Wei Ying.”

Wei Wuxian stirs, performatively sulking a little. 

Lan Wangji says it a third time, “Wei Ying,” and Wei Wuxian cracks an eye open in his direction. 

Lan Wangji sighs. He is not going to make this easy. Or maybe he is, because then Wei Wuxian says, after the silence goes on too long, “What, Lan Zhan? Is that you saying, ‘sorry, Wei Ying, I was being ridiculous’?”

Lan Wangji nods, once. It’s Wei Wuxian’s turn to sigh. 

“Fine. Whatever. It’s okay. I’m… sorry too.”

Somehow that makes it worse, this pit of dread and shame writhing in Lan Wangji’s belly. It’s not okay. It never has been. “I—” There are words that won’t form, a whole language that has never been at home on his tongue. That might not even exist. “I don’t—”

Wei Wuxian rolls onto his belly, propping up on his elbows, his hair falling out of its ribbon and over his shoulders. “I didn’t mean to freak you out, okay? I mean, lots of times I do. It’s fun to tease you. Need Lan Zhan to cough up blood? I’ll get naked! I *thought,* though, that it was maybe because you actually… you know, you’d thought about it so that’s why it…” Maybe there are words that fail Wei Wuxian too. He clears his throat, cheeks pink, and tries again. “You know, how there are things you’ve decided you can’t have because you’re ridiculous and a Lan but you like it when I make you do them anyway. Like eat sweets. Or miss curfew. Or…”

*Kiss you,* Lan Wangji thinks. A knot is lodged in his throat. It’s the closest they’ve come to acknowledging that happened.

Wei Wuxian is going valiantly on. “—wouldn’t ever if you didn’t really want me to, though. I thought you did, is all. But if you don’t…”

Lan Wangji swallows. He nods before Wei Wuxian can finish the sentence. Before he can realize he’s nodding and stop himself. 

Wei Wuxian falters, face on the verge of falling. “You don’t?” 

No. No, he meant—yes. He meant that Wei Wuxian is right. Yes to all of it. He wants it all, and he wants the plausible deniability of pretending he does not want, and perhaps it has reached the point where he can no longer have both. He closes his eyes, tired and hungry and miserable enough to admit which one he would rather give up. “Yes,” he says, making his throat form the word. 

“Yes, what?”

“Yes I do. Want that. I…”

The admission almost chokes him, even with no one else around for miles. There is a long dreaded silence. Only because it is so long does he hear the slight scraping of pebbles, someone trying to move silently in the dark. He opens his eyes, and Wei Wuxian is there. He has crawled over quietly, helpfully. Uncertainly. The sulk has fallen off his face; he looks as vulnerable now as Lan Wangji has ever seen him. 

Lan Wangji’s heart feels like a bruise, raw and tender in his chest. He had thought he was the only one who felt desperately vulnerable. Wei Wuxian doesn’t fear anything. Wei Wuxian fights dire owls and demon tortoises; he taunts Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu with merry exuberance. The look on his face says that Wei Wuxian fears this.

Lan Wangji doesn’t move a muscle, which makes Wei Wuxian tentatively respond to that welcome, crawling down and resting his head cautiously on Lan Wangji’s lap. 

The panic still flaps in his chest, the same as when Wei Wuxian says things like *I’ll carry you* or starts stripping off clothing. It flaps, but then it—settles. Touch, the thing he’s been so frightened of, does not obliterate him after all. Light as a bird that is still fledging its feathers, he rests his hand on Wei Wuxian’s head.

Wei Wuxian peeks up. “Lan Zhan, do not throw up on my head.”

In reply, Lan Wangji digs his fingers into his hair and tugs sharply. 

Wei Wuxian gasps, then snuggles down, apparently reassured of his welcome. When Lan Wangji politely removes his hand, Wei Wuxian politely places it back. Unaccustomed to this, Lan Wangji hesitates, then haltingly strokes the tangled mass of his hair. Then he strokes it again. It is silk, and he eventually and carefully begins to unknot it, combing his fingers down through the long length, allowed to have this, a gift received more than given. 

Wei Wuxian almost purrs, drowsy with contentment. Lan Wangji’s mind snags on that, flooded suddenly with a memory nearly a decade old. He couldn’t have been more than eight; they kept a sleek gray mouser in the kitchens, and he was the first to discover the litter of kittens she had birthed in secret. His little heart had nearly burst with wonder, lap full of tiny, warm, wriggling things, falling all over themselves to let him pet and cuddle them for hours on end.

He had been punished for that, discovered when he never heard the bell calling him to the evening meal. He was pulled to his feet, marched back to the dormitories, harshly scolded for lack of discipline, and for weeks he had searched through every nook, cranny and bolt-hole he could find in Cloud Recesses but the kittens were never seen again. 

Wei Wuxian, in his lap, has turned his head up to look at him. Lan Wangji’s hand has gone still; Wei Wuxian is checking, uncertain again, to see if the permission has been revoked. 

Lan Wangji resumes stroking his scalp, unsnarling a strand of hair from the red ribbon. Satisfied, Wei Wuxian settles back down, closing his eyes and allowing himself to drift back towards sleep. 

---- 

“I like your cold springs cave better,” Wei Wuxian decides, the fourth day. “Lan Yi was nice, and it was beautiful, and there were bunnies to play with.”

The steady chill, the stale air, has made Wei Wuxian overcompensate with the fire. He’s built it up too high, and they’re enduring it, sweating through their robes. Even so, it is a preposterous statement—one Lan Wangji is willing to allow for the sake of distraction.

“Mn,” he says, neutrally enough that Wei Wuxian will not be able to easily discern whether it means yes or no.

Wei Wuxian lifts up his hair, piling it on top of his head, leaning back against the wall. A bead of sweat slides down his neck. “Winter. Cloud Recesses. Lan Zhan. Tell me stories.”

Lan Wangji can feel the sweat prickling his scalp, pooling on his spine. He makes himself look sharply away from Wei Wuxian’s glistening neck.

“Lan Zhan. Winter. Cloud Recesses,” Wei Wuxian repeats like snapping his fingers to get his attention. He closes his eyes and sighs dreamily. “There must be so much snow.”

Lan Wangji is worn out enough, his defenses down enough, that *snow* twists in his heart, another lingering sense-memory that should have faded long before now. “There is snow,” he agrees.

“And it’s beautiful.” 

“It’s very beautiful.”

Wei Wuxian hums appreciatively. “Have you been in the cold springs when it’s winter?”

He has been in the cold springs in every type of weather imaginable. He has been when snow drops on the surface, when the air is so bone-chilling that his teeth clack uncontrollably, so cold the water’s almost warm, his senses all confused. He has followed cold down through the very concept of cold, down through pain, out to some heady precipice where it just feels effervescent and numbing. It’s like… he’s not exactly sure what it’s like. He once sat down with ink, brush, and paper, tried to put it in a poem, and failed.

He tells Wei Wuxian the first part, the way the snow touches the water and doesn’t immediately melt.

“You’d *have* to get naked then,” Wei Wuxian muses, almost to himself. “If you got out in wet robes you’d freeze to death on the spot before you could get dry or warm.” 

So then there’s heat now, more of it, just when Lan Wangji had almost conjured the mental sensation of cold. He can feel his skin, livid. He is tired and filthy and it’s not too dramatic to say he is dying of hunger—this should not be difficult.

“Lan Zhan, *do* you get naked?”

“Wei Ying,” he tries to say sharply. Instead, he sounds a little hoarse. 

Wei Wuxian says nothing, which is so unprecedented that Lan Wangji makes the fatal mistake of opening his eyes to look.

Wei Wuxian is smiling. He is lounging back against the rock, one arm on his head, a pile of inky hair slipping down his neck, like a picture in a book that Lan Wangji should not know exists. He is watching Lan Wangji, and smiling. Not even wickedly. Just a smile that is lovely and knowing, that could make a man walk off a cliff and fall to his death.

“*Wei Ying,*” Wei Wuxian growls softly, imitating Lan Wangji’s voice. 

“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says, since that seems to be all he can say.

Wei Wuxian’s face changes. He reads Lan Wangji’s face, finds something there that makes the knowing drop away, the pure loveliness remain. Lan Wangji’s breath catches. The moment stretches out like honey pulled out of its comb, their gazes locked, the blazing heat on his face and the crackling glow of the fire.

Which one of them tips forward first, he doesn’t know. All he knows is that Wei Wuxian meets him, already there when Lan Wangji lays their faces together and touches his lips with the dry, burning heat of his own.

Wei Wuxian kisses him back, a *rightness* about it that threads down his spine. It’s a shiver, in the heat. 

They don’t pull apart; the kiss ends, and they stay close, breath mingling. So close that it doesn’t take anything, Wei Wuxian’s fingers sliding around the back of his neck, to pull him back in. 

Lan Wangji has not had a drop of liquor this time. His head swims with it anyway, the soft press and drag of Wei Wuxian’s mouth, lips chapped from days of rationing water. He is dizzy with the knowledge that he can have this again, dizzy with the slightly clumsy way Wei Wuxian is pressing against him. Dizzy with the way he’s kissing Wei Wuxian back. Clumsy too, mouths pressed together, a strange feeling—*joy*—humming through him. His stomach clenching with pleasure. Wei Wuxian hisses softly like hot stones hitting water. 

Lan Wangji’s hand has slid down over his chest, where it hurts, where the brand is. He pulls it back, stricken. 

Wincing, Wei Wuxian rubs at the wound, then shakes his head, leans back in.

This time it is the sharp intake of Lan Wangji’s breath that stops them, pain searing down through his leg when Wei Wuxian brushes against it. “Sorry, Lan Zhan,” he whispers, sucking in air through his teeth, wincing on his behalf.

The reality of their circumstances is demanding attention. There is nothing ideal about it—they are hot, cramped, trapped, exhausted, lightheaded from hunger, in pain. They bump noses, adjust their weight, shift position, try again. And then Wei Wuxian is pulling back, letting his hands drop away without Lan Wangji’s permission.

It is like before, the kiss pulling out like the tide, leaving Lan Wangji on the shore. To clutch at it is to have it slide through his fingers like water. 

At least this time there is no pledge to never speak of it again. Wei Wuxian sits back, still close enough for their sleeves to brush. He picks a piece of ash off Lan Wangji’s robe, then smoothes a wrinkle, fussy little touches that don’t help calm the racing of Lan Wangji’s heart. And then Lan Wangji is looking up because he’s gotten to his feet. 

“I should—” Wei Wuxian says, and trails off. He gestures instead, a vague flop of his arm, picking up his black robe and disappearing into the darkness before Lan Wangji can make his tongue form the words, *come back.*

---- 

“Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says. 

Later that night, by the fire. Wei Wuxian has returned, freshly scrubbed from the pond. Bringing his damp robe for Lan Wangji to wash the soot and sweat off his skin. His outer robe, flimsy and dark, which has been wrung out and dried so many times there’s not much fine fabric left to ruin. Tomorrow Wei Wuxian will don it again, along with his belt and vambraces, and they will fight a monster. 

That accounts partially for the mood at the fire. Wei Wuxian is subdued, lost in his thoughts as he runs his robe through his hands, drying it over the flames. Tomorrow will be the last, best chance they have. Lan Wangji’s leg can bear more weight than yesterday; if they wait longer, they’ll be weaker. Together they’ve shared the nightly ration of water, the last of their medicine. The little burst of spring sunshine arrives, fainter now, but still there.

Another small stretch of quiet. “Wei Ying,” Lan Wangji says again. 

Wei Wuxian looks up, blinking. “Hmm?”

“I—” Lan Wangji says. 

Wei Wuxian, sensing something that needs his attention, folds the robe up, discarding it. He scoots back, reclaiming his place by the wall. “What?” he prompts Lan Wangji, nudging his elbow, after a fraught moment of silence. “Oh no.” He gasps. “Lan Zhan is going to tell me he’s sorry. Tell me how much he likes Mianmian.”

It’s a tease, like the first time. Wei Wuxian drawing him out, never as careless or oblivious as he lets on. But he says it a little bit recklessly, as if nerves get the better of him despite trying to hide it.

“No,” Lan Wangji says. 

“You *are* going to say sorry. That’s your sorry voice.”

“No.” 

He is not going to say that. It twists in his gut, like the way his hands twist in his robes, how un-sorry he is. But—there is something, Wei Wuxian is not completely wrong. 

“I never—I have only—” Lan Wangji swallows. He can do this. “If I did something badly, it would be helpful to know.” He announces it to the fire, his palms damp where his fists rest on his knees.

Once again, though, he finds himself looking over when Wei Wuxian doesn’t answer. 

“You mean— Lan Zhan. How would *I* know?” Wei Wuxian asks him sincerely. “How many people do you think I have kissed?”

Lan Wangji was not expecting that question. He tries to think, safely. “…Many?”

Wei Wuxian’s smile is slow-blooming and lazy and utterly provocative. “One,” he says. 

“One…?”

“*You,*” he says, in case Lan Wangji is slow. “So I’m flattered I am so obviously excellent at it that I must have kissed hundreds of people, Lan Zhan, but alas, I am naturally gifted, only you, I have been perfectly virtuous, saving myself for—ow!”

It feels wonderful to throw a handful of stones at him. Only once before has Lan Wangji given into that physical impulse—in the library, tearing an explicit book to shreds in his hands. It helps him rebalance, calm the head-spin from *one, you, only you.*

“So if you would like to do it again—”

“Yes.”

Wei Wuxian halts mid-sentence. It is wonderful too, to throw him so badly. Even if Lan Wangji blurted the word before he could think. 

“Huh?” Wei Wuxian says. 

“Yes.” Lan Wangji nods.

“You want to—”

Lan Wangji nods.

“Here?”

Nods.

“Now?”

Nods. 

“But your leg?”

“Is not falling off.” There are limits to Lan Wangji’s patience. 

Wei Wuxian gulps, bravado slipping. Lan Wangji, committed to this path of destruction, watches the slide of his throat. 

“Now?” he says again. 

Lan Wangji, sometimes, is forced to take initiative. He can’t exactly rise up on his knees; instead, he drags Wei Wuxian over by the front of his robe into the full force of his kiss. 

Wei Wuxian kind of—*mmumphs.* They collide. It does jar his leg, but Lan Wangji is briefly beyond caring. He does not let Wei Wuxian go; when he finally pulls back, Wei Wuxian stares at him, eyes huge, then coughs and breaks into laughter that sheds more warmth than the fire. 

“Lan Zhan!” he exclaims, scandalized, and pushes their mouths back together with no finesse whatsoever. He is half in Lan Wangji’s lap before good sense arrives and he darts backwards enough to avoid Lan Wangji’s leg. 

“No,” Lan Wangji says irrationally, not releasing his grip on the front of Wei Wuxian’s robe. 

Wei Wuxian pats his hand gently, prying his fingers loose. “I have an idea,” he assures him, which has never *not* struck fear in Lan Wangji’s heart. Before he knows how to accommodate this turn of events, Wei Wuxian has climbed across him, dropping over to his good side. He taps Lan Wangji’s knee, the one that does not make his head spin in agony. “Lan Zhan. Open your legs.”

At Lan Wangji’s look, he rolls his eyes so dramatically they might fall out of his head. 

“So I don’t hurt the bad one,” he says. 

Oh. Lan Wangji… obeys. Wei Wuxian straddles his good leg, perching there, one knee between them, keeping most of his weight off of Lan Wangji’s thigh.

“How’s this?” he asks. “Hurts?”

Lan Wangji checks. He shakes his head no. 

“Good,” Wei Wuxian says. He licks his lips, surveying the options for his next course of action. He settles down a bit more, so they’re mostly face to face, resting his hands on Lan Wangji’s shoulders. Then he frowns, taking Lan Wangji’s empty hands, placing one on the back of his neck, the other safely at his waist, out of reach of the still-tender brand. “All right?”

*No.* Very much *not all right.* Very much *not ever going to be all right again.* 

Lan Wangji jerks his head in a nod. 

The smile returns, the one from before, the slow-blooming one, full of delight and lazy provocation. Wei Wuxian’s hands come back to rest on Lan Wangji’s shoulders. He leans in, close enough that his breath ghosts over his lips. “Lan Zhan?”

Lan Wangji, staring at the way Wei Wuxian’s mouth glistens, red as a berry, says, “Mn?”

“Kiss me.”

Lan Wangji finds his heart beating wildly. This is… real, without the plausible deniability of impulse or frustration or even the helpful pretext of inebriation. He can’t help it, he freezes, too much to process at once, and if he does this wrong— 

Wei Wuxian huffs fondly, tips his face up and kisses him. 

It’s a *kiss.* Slow and real, and intent, not the clumsy crushing of mouths Lan Wangji had attempted. His grip tightens, fingers digging into Wei Wuxian’s waist, into the nape of his neck. Wei Wuxian responds with a gasp. Heat that is not from the fire curls up Lan Wangji’s spine. 

Wei Wuxian, when they part, brushes his thumb across Lan Wangji’s cheek. “Ahh. Lan Zhan *does* blush,” he whispers, and more heat, more color floods beneath Lan Wangji’s skin. Grinning, Wei Wuxian bumps him with his nose. He kisses him there, then next to his ear, experimenting. “*You* wanted this, Lan Zhan,” he reminds him, dropping down to nuzzle his neck, a tender spot that sends a flurry of sparks down through Lan Wangji’s body.

Lan Wangji is going to combust. He will not get to fight a demon tortoise; he will be a pile of ash on the ground long before rescue comes. He makes a strangled sound in his throat—Wei Wuxian rewards it with laughter, a puff of air that chases shivers up and down Lan Wangji’s skin. 

It feels safest to take back control of kiss. He does, pulling Wei Wuxian back up to his mouth, but Wei Wuxian is not so easily deterred. He nips at Lan Wangji’s mouth, not a kiss. Brushes their lips together, not a kiss. Licks at him, teasing—not a kiss. Then he slides their mouths back together, waiting until instinct has Lan Wangji opening up a fraction and letting him in. 

They both make a sound when their tongues touch. Heat floods odd places on Lan Wangji’s body—the inside of his elbows, his thighs, the top of his scalp. It feels like being born, or like dying. Nothing has prepared him for Wei Wuxian in his mouth making soft, desperate noises, the slick heat of his tongue, drinking Lan Wangji in like he’s the water they’ve had to ration to keep from dying of thirst.

When they pull back the next time—nothing is left of the arrogant, loose-limbed flirt. Wei Wuxian is trembling. Lan Wangji is sure he is too, the kisses dragging sensation over his skin like dry grass. 

“That,” Wei Wuxian says. Licks his lips. “That was. Is that—Lan Zhan, is that the best we can do?”

Lan Wangji drags him back in. A laugh bubbles up, trapped between them. Lan Wangji kisses him quiet, Wei Wuxian pressed against him, one hand on the wall behind Lan Wangji’s head. It is Lan Wangji’s turn to make soft, desperate noises, clinging to him, until Wei Wuxian shifts again, gentling the kiss just a little, winding his arms around Lan Wangji’s neck.

They kiss like that for ages. They kiss and kiss, sinking down into it, Lan Wangji learning every curve of Wei Wuxian’s lips, every hitch of his breath, each warm, wet angle of Wei Wuxian’s mouth. They find a pace they can sustain and apply themselves to it. They kiss breathlessly, endlessly. They kiss sloppily, playfully. They kiss so slow and so long that they need to pause, parched, and drink from their precious ration of water. Kiss until their lips are bruised; until Lan Wangji’s jaw aches, until his leg is numb with pins and needles. Kiss until they are giddy with it, then serious all over again.

“Wei Ying,” he finally rasps, Wei Wuxian’s hips in his hands. Slithery hips that won’t stop *moving.* They are a hairsbreadth from a *rhythm,* from—Lan Wangji meeting him, moving too. It is taking his last thread of willpower and quite a bit of pain to stop him. And even then—

“We could, though,” Wei Wuxian says. Breath hot on Lan Wangji’s ear. He is panting a little. He says it lightly, the way he once said *you could kiss me, you know. Just as friends. I wouldn’t mind.* One hand has slipped beneath the outer layers of Lan Wangji’s robe, skimming up and down his side where the thin robe fits his body. “We could, Lan Zhan. I wouldn’t hurt you. I promise. I could just—”

Lan Wangji screws his eyes shut, leaning back against the rock. He wants to. He wants to so much. He has possibly never wanted anything more in his life than he wants to just let it happen, let their hips press together, where he is so hot and so hard, feel the aching relief, the release of arousal. He can’t even recall a reason for *not* letting it happen. They are here—not ideal, but also, as they’ve established, not entirely prohibitive. His leg—but Wei Wuxian is right, they could be careful, they would try not to hurt him. It is simply habit to fight it. He has been fighting it for what feels like half of his life. 

“No, I know,” Wei Wuxian says, conducting his own conversation with Lan Wangji’s silences. “I do. I know. I know we can’t.” 

“Wei Ying,” he says again, and doesn’t know what the plea is for. 

Wei Wuxian makes the choice for them. He kisses Lan Wangji again, a long, slow dip into a pool that is so warm, so all-encompassing, it makes tears spring behind Lan Wangji’s eyelids. His throat closes up, his senses too overwhelmed to do anything but cling to him. And then Wei Wuxian brings it to an end, resting their foreheads together for a moment before he pulls back to look at Lan Wangji. Holding his face in his hands, he smiles bravely, barely faltering. It’s his smile of utter reassurance, conveying, *there is nothing you can do to make me like you less, you have nothing to fear.* 

“Can I think about this sometimes?” Wei Wuxian asks him. His hair so wrecked and mouth so kissed that Lan Wangji’s hands tighten vice-like on his hipbones. “Back home. In bed alone. When I think about Lan Zhan late at night, and want to remember how he feels, so I can…” He trails off suggestively.

He is twinkling again, a little bit wicked. Making it safe for them. Making it normal. Playing the fool. Trying to scandalize Lan Wangji. It will take a lot more than that, even though the flush rises, predictably, all over his skin. 

“Yes,” says Lan Wangji, since that scenario means that Wei Wuxian will be home and safe. 

Wei Wuxian laughs from his belly, dragging Lan Wangji in to smother him with a hug. He drops a kiss on his hair, on his forehead, on the bridge of his nose like a *ridiculous* person. 

“You may do the same,” he offers gravely. Then shakes again with mirth, one last kiss in response to the look on Lan Wangji’s face. 

---- 

After a while, they bank the fire. Tend to the few necessities. Wei Wuxian is quiet again, serious, as he checks the bandages on Lan Wangji’s leg. Tomorrow looms over them, once again unavoidable, no more distractions to keep it at bay. 

Side by side, they stretch out. The ground is still rocky, the embers popping softly, the coals still shedding warmth. Lan Wangji breathes in and out. Stomach rising and falling beneath his folded hands. 

He turns to look at Wei Wuxian. 

“Hmm?” Wei Wuxian says, an arm’s length away in the dark. 

After a moment, he affects a sigh, obeying the silent order as he drags himself over, arriving as bidden, bedding down snugly at Lan Wangji’s side. 

“Better?” Wei Wuxian asks. He reaches for Lan Wangji’s face, mouth puckered, a genuine smile when Lan Wangji swats him away. Satisfied, he rests his arm across Lan Wangji instead, laying his head on his shoulder. 

Lan Wangji, who is still wearing multiple layers of robes, and who is closest to the fire, tucks the dark outer robe around him. 

“Hmmph. *Now* he’s nice to me.” Wei Wuxian grunts drowsily against his chest. “All I had to do was seduce him with my virginal wiles… ow.”

Lan Wangji pinches the soft flesh inside his elbow. 

Wei Wuxian rubs it, hissing, then nestles back down. “Okay gege, I’ll behave.”

---- 

It is achingly intimate, even more so than Wei Wuxian’s tongue in his mouth, to have Wei Wuxian’s voice in his head. If only it could always be so simple—to merely think and have his thoughts arrive in Wei Wuxian’s mind, unobstructed by his own clumsy tongue.

It is like the dire owl, in the forest. Like the dancing fairy; like the kiss. They work together, instinct that defies all logical thought, the push and pull, the give and take, of being in accord with each other. As fluid as a dance; a life and death dance that they almost lose, right up until they… win. 

It doesn’t feel like a win. It feels like Wei Wuxian’s dead weight in his arms, hauling him limp from the water. It feels like his cold, clammy pallor, his weak, erratic pulse. It feels like Lan Wangji’s own hands, shredded to ribbons, slick with blood, helpless to do anything except offer the very last thread of his spiritual energy. His heart seizing when Wei Wuxian coughs and smiles weakly. 

And asks him to sing. 

----

Time truly stops, this time. Lan Wangji only thought the hours bled out before. One day, possibly—possibly two. It ceases to have any meaning, any unit of time that isn’t the ragged space between Wei Wuxian’s breaths. 

Rescue, when it comes, finds him clutching Wei Wuxian the way Wei Wuxian clutches the sword. It is a cacophony, disorienting, a nightmare, a blur—Lan Wangji is shaken awake, spoken to like an irrational child about how they are here now and he must let Wei Wuxian go. 

Up above, it is blinding. He drinks all the water they’ll give him, eats a few bites of mild rations, and doesn’t leave Wei Wuxian’s side. 

“What’s that ugly thing he’s got?” Jiang Wanyin demands. 

“It’s his,” is all Lan Wangji says. 

“Whatever.”

Hours pass. Half a day. He needs to go. They’ve told him all the news they’ve heard from Gusu. Not much. He needs to go. Jin Zixuan can spare a few men to send with him, and provisions. He pleads in silence, *wake up,* which is no more effective than it was in the cave. 

*I’ll come find you,* he vows, mentally pressing the words into Wei Wuxian’s mind the way they had done underground. *In Lotus Pier, I’ll come find you. As soon as I can. They’ll take care of you now.* 

Duty might tear him in two. Carefully, Lan Wangji pulls a strand of hair back from Wei Wuxian’s sweat-streaked, pale face. They’re alone, but too many Jins and Jiangs mill about to kiss him. 

*I’ll come,* he swears, leaving. *As soon as I can. No matter what.*

----

He is not able to change anything. Find his brother, save Cloud Recesses. Make his uncle well again. It either happens or it doesn’t, regardless of his presence. 

So it haunts him—what if—what if Wei Wuxian—*after.* What if he had stayed. If he had been *there,* instead of elsewhere, and helpless. 

Would it have mattered? Would things have changed?
