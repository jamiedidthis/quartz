One month. In that way, it’s easier this time—it was in Yiling where Wei Wuxian went missing before, presumed dead for three months, and now it has only been one. Not dead, not missing, but cut off from the cultivation world like an unwelcome limb.

Lan Wangji is with Xichen the day the letter arrives. Xichen unfolds it, reading in silence for several long minutes without changing his expression. 

“Brother,” Lan Wangji says, when he can stand it no longer. 

Brushwork that elegant, paper that fine; it can only be from Lanling. Xichen looks up, relaying Jin Guangyao’s account of how he has been working day and night in preparation for the wedding. 

That is not Lan Wangji’s concern. “And?” he says. 

An infinitesimal pause; an infinitesimal shake of his head. “He won’t be attending,” Xichen says. “They thought it prudent… not to inform him.”

Birds flit in the autumn-bright branches around them, unaffected by the news, by the petty, bloodless cruelties humans will inflict on each other. *Not inform him.* It’s only the marriage of the person he loves most in the world. (To the person he despises most in the world.) Jiang Yanli is not behind this, of that at least Lan Wangji is certain. 

“He should know,” Lan Wangji says, trying to keep his voice neutral. 

Xichen does not disagree. “But that is for his clan, and the Jins… it is not our place to say.” 

Not their place. The blood feud between the Jins and the Wen refugees—not their place. Cultivators killed, Wei Wuxian exiled—not their place. 

“Wangji,” Xichen says, warning. “It wouldn’t be wise, if you wrote to inform him.” 

“No,” Lan Wangji agrees. 

“Promise me that you won’t.” 

“Write to him? I won’t,” Lan Wangji says.

Yiling buzzes like a wasp’s nest. It’s almost comforting, really—Wei Wuxian must be nearby.

The intensity of the rumors, the wild distortions, are worse here than in Gusu. Yiling-laozhu, they’ve started calling him, the kind of puerile game one doesn’t always outgrow in childhood, creating monsters or villains in order to play the hero. Lan Wangji can only imagine how much Wei Wuxian is feeding these rumors himself, entertained by the tales. This isn’t supposed to be a *game.* 

Every teahouse, every tavern, has a variation of the tale, each more outlandish than the last. Of course it’s not only that—other minor rumors and dramas still grip the populace too. But that’s what Lan Wangji’s ear is tuned for, and so that is what he hears. 

Ghouls and demons—no, fierce corpses! *Armies* of the dead. Virgin orgies; infant sacrifices. *If anything, Wei Wuxian would not be that organized,* Lan Wangji thinks wryly, would tell anyone who would listen. 

Nobody is interested in the truth. The lies that bother him most are the ones that most closely echo what was said in Jinlintai. Wei Wuxian is a traitor; Wei Wuxian is mediocre at best; if not for the mercy of the Jiangs he’d be on the streets where he belongs, and look what he’s done to repay them. 

Or—worst of all: someone like him doesn’t deserve to live.

It’s that last one that drives Lan Wangji out of the teahouse into Yiling’s bustling main street. The harsh glare of sunlight, stares from the crowd. A tiny, dusty child in brown robes who collides with Lan Wangji’s legs, depositing himself at his feet. 

Lan Wangji stares down. The little boy clings like a limpet, a bright-eyed grin that says no one has taught him this is not a proper thing to do. “No…?” Lan Wangji says, afraid it comes out like a question. Of the two of them, he’s not the one who bursts into tears.

*This* is your fearsome Yiling-laozhu, Lan Wangji thinks more than once, once he is able to think. 

It is a heartstopping sight, Wei Wuxian parting the crowds like the clouds that can’t hide the sun. Collecting the boy by the hand—because of course Wei Wuxian has somehow acquired a *child* when he’s supposed to be busy raising armies of corpses. Drying his tears, dusting his robes. Swordfighting with toys in the street, flying paper-winged butterflies, the two of them turning twin grins upon him like they are *trying* to stop Lan Wangji’s heart.

This is the Wei Wuxian he knows. The undimmed sunlight of him, none of the fury from Lanling, or the cold and miserable distance the last time he reappeared from the dead. He is changed—still, again—frighteningly thin and shabbily dressed—but the old goodness shines through him, scrubbed clean and unclouded, at ease with himself in a way that Lan Wangji has not seen in a very long time. 

He feels mauled by it, this unexpected turn of events, so far outside his experience that all he can do is be himself, slightly stiff, slightly bitchy, warm all over when that’s the Lan Wangji these two accept unequivocally, delighted with him, laying claim to him as easily as they do with each other.
