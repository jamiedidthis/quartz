This is one of those thought technologies I notice all the time now, seemingly everywhere I look.

> ==When futurist Roy Amara said “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run,” he wasn’t really making a statement about technology, he was making a statement about human cognition.== We’re pattern-seeking creatures whose minds tend to think in linear terms within the near future, a tendency which served us well in our evolutionary history when trying to predict when it’s safe to reproduce and where the mammoths will be, but which is absolutely useless in predicting large-scale movements which may be nonlinear. It’s possible that the only reason the predictions the hippies were making about the “great awakening” that started in the sixties was solely because of this cognitive bias Amara spoke of. Perhaps we overestimated the short-term effects of that shift and underestimated its ongoing effects in the long term. —[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], [The Humans Are Waking Up](https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/the-humans-are-waking-up-eb47bcfe6fac)

It’s gotta be true about the internet/technology in general — we’re caught in the muck of it right now but there’s no way connecting billions of human brains globally won’t be a massive shift from what came before. I see it in reference to the covid-19 pandemic too, bemoaning that we haven’t learned anything from it or that we’ve gone back to how it was before, but we *haven’t*… the seismic shifts (and fractures) are just in the very beginning stages of a ripple.

I think that’s why it always boggles me that people expect instantly visible change, or a linear progression of events. Change doesn’t work like that. Time doesn’t work like that. 5–10 years is absolutely nothing on a planetary time scale — hell, 5–10 centuries isn’t even a blip. The long term effects of anything take decades if not centuries to catch up to us… think the industrial age, the invention of lightbulbs on our circadian rhythm, germ theory (which arguably caused the population explosion that threw our ecosystem out of whack), and so forth.

Amara’s law? https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/01/03/estimate/
