I’ve realized that when I want to “be kind,” it’s always directed outwardly to another person. Not inwardly. It takes effort to think of “be kind” when I mean myself.

What does that look like relationally? If I do live according to my principle of kindness, but it includes–or nay, even prioritizes–myself?

Would that mean I wouldn’t tolerate anyone’s unkindness towards me? Besides, being kind to others definitely doesn’t mean putting up with their awful behavior just to keep them comfortable.

How often do I conflate the two?
