It’s not a stretch to say that every book I’ve read has shaped my thinking in one way or another, even the bad ones (grrr, Harari). But there’s a group of core texts that are so foundational, that have had such a lasting impact, you couldn’t reconstruct my current map of the world without them. It’s descriptive, not prescriptive—I couldn’t even time travel to dump these books on my younger self and hope to recreate their effect, because I had to encounter them at the right time, with all the surrounding context and compost that nurtured the ideas to take root. 

But take root they have. If not these texts, it would have been others. And indeed, the list continues to evolve. 

In no particular order: 

- [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]], [[series/terra ignota|the Terra Ignota series]] (*[[books/too like the lightning|Too Like The Lightning]], [[books/seven surrenders|Seven Surrenders]], [[books/the will to battle|The Will to Battle]], [[books/perhaps the stars|Perhaps the Stars]]*) — literally rewired my brain for how the flow of history works, and how change happens. Each time I re-reread it, it unsticks something further. Instead of being so tied to the present and my limited point of view, it gives me tools to think about the future we could build, and more importantly, what cannot be controlled or foreseen. 
- [[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language]]* — daily affects how I think about language and communication, especially the rapidly evolving language of online memes and texts. We’re not breaking English, we’re building it into something more emotive, relational, and fluid. 
- [[authors/ursula k le guin|Ursula K. Le Guin]], “[[notes/the carrier bag theory of fiction|The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction]]” from *[[books/dancing at the edge of the world|Dancing at the Edge of the World]]* — completely infected the way I think about narrative and structure, and ~~heroism~~ botulism. Seek the carrier bags, not the spears. (All of Le Guin, really — particularly *[[books/the left hand of darkness|The Left Hand of Darkness]], [[books/the lathe of heaven|The Lathe of Heaven]], [[books/the dispossessed|The Dispossessed]],* and *[[books/always coming home|Always Coming Home]].*)
- [[authors/kurt vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut]], *[[books/galapagos|Galápagos]]* — much like *Terra Ignota,* although years before it, it shapes the way I think about the past and the future, and how it knocks us off our pedestal. Humans are far, far from some mythical pinnacle of evolution, it’s going to keep taking us into weird and unknown territory.
- [[authors/italo calvino|Italo Calvino]], *[[books/the complete cosmicomics|Cosmicomics]]* — quite a bit of Calvino is foundational for me, but this one is particularly a treasure. It sparked my interest in cybernetics and feedback loops, all with storytelling, not science.
- [[authors/jo walton|Jo Walton]], *[[books/lent|Lent]]* — I will never think of Girolamo Savonarola the same way, which means I think of many notorious historical figures in different ways. It blew the doors off my mind in a way that erased the last vestiges of fundamentalism clinging around in my brain—and by that I mean, the anti-fundamentalism of someone who had left a fundamentalist system but hadn’t unlearned that thinking, had just put it in a different set of clothes. 
- [[authors/lao tzu|Lao Tzu]], *[[books/tao te ching|Tao Te Ching]]* — many different translations to piecemeal it together, but the very fact that Le Guin’s faithful/less rendering is the one I pick up most often speaks to the core of what draws me to the text. No purity, no perfection, no dogma, just a clear deep well to drink from, full of lightness, paradox, and humor. 
- [[authors/david graeber|David Graeber]] — the entire corpus of his work, even what I haven’t read yet.

## Politically inclined

The books that have been the most helpful in giving me a clear-eyed view of the world.

- Anything by [[authors/arundhati roy|Arundhati Roy]], particularly *[[books/capitalism|Capitalism: A Ghost Story]]* as a primer or *[[books/my seditious heart|My Seditious Heart]]* as the omnibus 
- *[[books/manufacturing consent|Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of Mass Media]]*, [[authors/noam chomsky|Noam Chomsky]] and [[authors/edward herman|Edward Herman]]
