That common claim that people are so stupid—particularly that one’s fellow Americans are so stupid—yeah, it’s not about being stupid. It’s about being abused.

> Have you ever tried to help a friend or family member get out of a cult? It’s not easy. In fact, most times it’s nearly impossible and it requires more love and patience than many of us have in the tank. Cults are held in place by a few key factors — to be a good cult leader, you have to isolate your members from normal society, frighten them regularly into a state of dissociation, hypnotize them while they’re in that state of dissociation with your commands, present yourself as their savior, and suck them dry of their resources while presenting enlightenment/heaven/salvation/the rapture/Trump’s impeachment/single payer healthcare as just around the corner.

> The corporatist propaganda machine does all of these things with alarming efficiency. So what we have here is not a stupidity problem, it’s a propaganda problem. It’s an abuse problem. It’s a cult problem. All the things you would expect to see in a cult victim, you see in today’s American. Stockholm syndrome is an especially sticky symptom.

Me. 🙋🏻‍♀️ I was born and raised in a cult. I got out of the cult, and have helped some of my friends and family get out of the cult. The similarities aren’t even similarities—it’s the exact same thing, especially the utter fear and confusion. Get someone that afraid and confused—which escalates into terrified and disoriented—and they will cling to whatever life raft you throw them, no matter how nonsensical it is.

I see it big time on the right, which is just a larger extension of the hardcore evangelical cult I know all too well, but it’s exactly the same on the left, just swapping out the names and team colors. Different carrot, same stick.

It does take a lot, a lot, a lot of love and patience to get someone out. With my mom, it took about twenty years. But gentleness and love is the key. Harshness or mockery chases them back into what feels safe—exactly what any authoritarian wants. 

IMO, the best thing is curiosity, humor, lack of judgement, warmth. Realizing you’ve been fooled is, as Caitlin says, a horrible quiet internal foot-fall of hot-faced humility.
