Nooooo. I thought I had finally found the holy grail, cycling fiction (nay, romance!) that *actually represents the sport of pro cycling with a modicum of accuracy.* The dedication is to Wouter Weylandt. (!) There‚Äôs a glossary of French terms and race classifications. Four pages in she‚Äôs name-dropping Garmin-Sharp and Fausto Coppi. My expectations, below sea level, started to gain elevation.

Energy gels are ‚Äúpackets of high-carb, electrolyte-laden goo that tasted like chemical fruit with the consistency of semen.‚Äù (lol.) Her Italian cyclist knows English, French, German, Spanish, and ‚Äúenough Flemish to insult Belgian riders‚Äîit‚Äôs important to insult them so they understand.‚Äù (Ha! Accurate to message boards I‚Äôve been on.) Pillow talk is Contador, Pantani, and Big Mig. Great choice, no notes. üëå

And then. And then.

I don‚Äôt know how an author could research enough to get the above details correct, yet have it go so off the rails! By chapter 5, I was side-eyeing a couple things. By chapter 14, my rant-notes were getting extensive. By chapter 21, I had so many WTFs that I wrote myself the note to ‚Äúwalk it off, Jamie, walk it off‚Äù‚Ä¶ and then I did, pacing around the room to cool down.

As I‚Äôve established [[books/racing to you|multiple]] [[books/the black jersey|times]], what a cycling fan wants is to be entertained and to nitpick. I damn well made it to the end, so allow me to indulge in the pleasure of WTF-ing all over the place with my 20 years of nutso cycling fan bonafides.

### The Facepalm Index

- [Team Garmin-Sharp](https://www.cyclingnews.com/teams/2013/garmin-sharp/). Aw, 2012‚Äì2014 nostalgia! A training camp in Boulder, CO is also accurate for that team, and thankfully Singer places her MC cyclist, Luca Biondi, on the fictional team Antano-Clark instead of alongside Vandevelde and co. A bit of a stretch that a second world tour team would do altitude training in the US instead of Europe, but I can handwave it. **0/10 facepalms.**
- Luca‚Äôs palmares includes winning the white young rider‚Äôs jersey at La Fl√®che Wallonne, which‚Ä¶ no. Fl√®che is a one-day classic, the classics do not give jerseys like the stage races. Hopefully this is just a grammar mixup since they also discuss grand tours in the same sentence. **1/10 facepalms.**
- More nostalgia! Luca‚Äôs first on page race is Driedaagse van West Vlaanderen, which became [Dwars door West-Vlaanderen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwars_door_West-Vlaanderen), and then ceased to exist after 2018. Not to be confused with [Dwars door Vlaanderen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwars_door_Vlaanderen), a different event altogether and still a key part of Flemish Cycling Week. **0/10 facepalms.**
- The bib numbers are inept! üò´ In cycling, the numbers change with each race and are a wealth of information at a glance: the first 1‚Äì2 digits are the team number, the last digit is the rider‚Äôs number. The previous year‚Äôs winning team is #1, then each World Tour team is numbered either alphabetically or by ranking, followed by the continental teams alphabetically or by ranking. With Luca in bib #141 at a 2.1 race (so, not as many pro teams), I spent a several minutes thinking Antano-Clark was a continental team and thus Luca‚Äôs career was much worse off than I thought. Oops. **2/10 facepalms.**
- At least #141 does designate Luca as team leader (the last digit is a 1, given to the team leader for each race, and then the rest of the team is numbered in alphabetical order). But the opening stage is a time trial, and she has each rider going off in numerical order (#136 five slots before #141, etc). Just‚Ä¶ no! A prologue time trial[^1] will give each team *x* number of time slots throughout the day, and barring bad weather, the best riders (i.e. pro teams and their leaders) usually get the later slots. The Olympic time trial champion[^2] would‚Ä¶ well, not be racing Driedaagse at all, but if he was, would NOT be #199! For one, #199 wouldn‚Äôt exist for 8 man teams, but if by a wild fluke it did, or if we say #198 instead, it would be the most no-name of no-nome continental team domestiques, who never have the budget to specialize in the highly technical time trial discipline. This will only bother me but it really bothers me, **4/10 facepalms**.
- She throws a little shade at La Mondiale‚Äôs ugly brown shorts and this is correct, everyone mocks the ugly brown shorts! (2024 is the first season in at least two decades where they changed their brown kit, and I am shook.) **0/10 facepalms.** 
- However she calls it a uniform, not a kit. **1/10 facepalms.**
- There‚Äôs no sprint points or king of the mountains in Driedaagse, nor does the leader wear a yellow jersey. Noooo. **6/10 facepalms.**
- A *climber* winning a *sprint* and getting a *timegap* from a *breakaway* in Driedaagse‚Ä¶ hell no. **6/10 facepalms.**
- 
- By my count she‚Äôs invented two teams, Antano-Clark and Duclos-Wurth. The rest are all IRL teams circa 2013‚ÄìLampre, Sky, Euskatel-Euskadi, Argos-Shimano, Cannondale. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about this, but the names she invents blends seamlessly with the real ones, **0/10 facepalms.**
