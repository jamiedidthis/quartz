I always collect brilliant opening lines, but how is this for an opening paragraph, from [[authors/ursula k le guin|Ursula K. Le Guinâ€™s]] *[[books/the lathe of heaven|The Lathe of Heaven]]*: 

> Current-borne, wave-flung, tugged hugely by the whole might of ocean, the jellyfish drifts in the tidal abyss. The light shines through it, and the dark enters it. Borne, flung, tugged from anywhere to anywhere, for in the deep sea there is no compass but nearer and farther, higher and lower, the jellyfish hangs and sways; pulses move slight and quick within it, as the vast diurnal pulses beat in the moon-driven sea. Hanging, swaying, pulsing, the most vulnerable and insubstantial creature, it has for its defense the violence and power of the whole ocean, to which it has entrusted its being, its going, and its will.

(And Haber calls George Orr a moral jellyfish, and a queer fish.)
