[[authors/lynn margulis|Lynn Margulis]] coined the word “holobionts”—multispecies assemblages that are both more and less than one. All organisms are effectively “chimeric.”

> A holobiont is an assemblage of beings that create a larger whole. The word was first used in 1991 by Lynn Margulis in an attempt to explain her studies of hosts and inherited symbionts. … The closer we look at our bodies, the flimsier the idea of an individual, bounded self becomes. We are walking communities, swarms in suits and ties, skin-silhouetted Towers of Babel. —[[authors/sophie strand|Sophie Strand]], *[[books/the flowering wand|The Flowering Wand]]*
