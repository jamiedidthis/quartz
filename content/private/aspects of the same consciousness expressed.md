I like the thought experiment that takes animism, or Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism), or a myriad of various philosophies, sciences, or spiritualities one step further.

What if everything on earth… is me? What if I am every person who has lived or died? What if every one of us is? It’s a Buddhist practice to open the doors of compassion, or a Hindu belief system, or a radical metaphysical theory, but taken conceptually, seriously, literally… how would that shift my perception? 

Many spiritual disciplines suggest that’s what enlightenment is, the revelations that we are all manifestations of the same consciousness. Extend that (like I do) to include [[notes/the indigenous attribution of agency|the indigenous attribution of agency]], and every river, every leaf, every birth and every death… is me.
