I like expanding the definition of cults and cult-like ideologies—most are too narrow, pretending that the Jonestown or Moonies version is all that exists. It does not. In my experience, the most effective cults are the ones who can point to The Real Cults and say, *see! We’re not like that! You’re crazy for even suspecting it!*

The core traits of a good cult: 
- exclusive access to the truth
- 
- fragments your reality — *see how crazy and confusing things are? We have all the answers!!*
- isolates you from reality — *hey, you should only listen to us, everyone else is lying to you*
- appeals to your inner goodness — *everyone else is deceived/backwards/hopeless, this is how we save them* 
- 
- demands 100% loyalty — *ooh, even questioning one thing, that’s a slippery slope… that’s just what \[insert bad guys here\] wants!*
- feeds the ego — *you’re special/saved/enlightened/intelligent/worthy/the hero* (bonus points when this comes with extra special false humility, *oh* I’m *not special, I’m just humble and normal)*
- puts you in the in-group — *you’re soooo much smarter than all the unwashed, gullible masses over here! Ugh, look at them, aren’t you glad you’re special/saved/enlightened/intelligent/worthy/a christian/an atheist/a democrat/a republican
