## Ep 1
- WWX resurrecting in Jin color robes 😂 cannot fully appreciate the irony of this the first time around 
- Lan clan using the lure flags he made; already innovating 😭
- SZ recognizing Wuji from LWJ playing it in Gusu 😭 (ALSO, he would be not realizing he recognizes it from WWX playing it in Burial Mounds)
- Btw Lan Yuan (愿) means “wishes” and Lan Si Zhui (思追) means “miss you and chase you”, so basically Si Zhui is a love letter to Wei Ying from Lan Zhan

---
## Ep 2
- Is WWX your dad? / No he’s my idol. 🤣🤣
- Per JL: MZ didn’t have enough spiritual power to cultivate (so now you’ve resorted to evil tricks)
- (Also if JL was smart, here’s how to know it’s not MZ—he doesn’t recognize  JL or know what happened to his parents)
- LWJ already zapping ppl (JL) trying to hurt WWX  😭 
- JC to LWJ in front of WWX: you really are where the trouble is; are you looking for someone; you’ve been a lot of places the last 16 years (he asks are you looking for someone before he’s really spotted WWX/MZ—so this is just a common occurrence / annoyance for him??)
- SZ best boy at diplomacy, doing all the talking for LWJ
- Silence spell for JL 😆 
- LWJ such a good dad: “Go do your work. Just try your best. Don’t force yourselves.” (Especially compared to JC) 
- (Beautiful lingering face of WWX listening to this in the special edition)

- LWJ knows it’s WWX, but all about making him feel safe 😭
- “I thought I could be indifferent to the world, but nobody can repress their feelings after all” 😢 
- SZ at the Wen graves, doesn’t know that’s his people or where he lived before 😭 
- Jingyi using one of the monster compasses that WWX invented 😀 (*did* he invent it, or did he steal it off that impersonator dude?? lol)
- JL super archery skills like WWX 😭 
- Dancing fairy an illusion to get WWX to summon WN. NHS knew, there when WWX and LWJ sealed her
- Start of flashback: JY says they have **10 days** before the ceremony starts

- LWJ already staring up at the rooftop having mad feels
- Wen Ruohan: “West of Dafan, east of Gusu, north of Yueyang—where is the last shard of Yin Iron?” (XY: I’ll tell you where after I get the one in Yueyang)
- So WR already knows there’s a fifth, and it’s in Xuanwu?

---
## Ep 4
- LWJ pretty feisty against the Wens—wanting to jump into the fight like WWX, but gets the headshake from LXC
- The presentation ceremony is the first day (WWX already writing lines, lol)—he’s telling NHS about the fight with LWJ “last night”
- Did 40 copies the first night (of his first batch of 300, then sentenced to 1000 more) — but even reading them takes hours in class 
- 1300/40= 32.5 days to finish them all (probably longer because of dawdling, mistakes, more added, etc.)
- One of the Lan principles—“don’t indulge in pleasure”
- Distracted by NHS’s canary during the “don’t take evil paths” part 😆 
- NHS being the matchmaker with MY and LXC just like with WWX and LWJ 😂
- Orchid House = classroom

- First calls him Wei Ying after the pornography book 😂
- “It was my pleasure to help him break the rules.” 😂
- Beautiful smile @ 13:14, not one of the usual ones
- LWJ calls him Wei Ying when talking to LXC
- “Fuddy duddy put me in confinement for **three days**” — so the show makes it look like a very short period of time but they’re actually in Cloud Recesses for six months soooo 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
- LWJ: no no no / LXC: so you wanted them to come
- LWJ’s long pause at the bed in the room 😆

- Comb is an emblem of lovesickness
- LWJ: what WWX said is not unreasonable 

---
## Ep 6
- I don’t know how the Lans of Gusu put up with you / hey, I’m adorable (3:40, while they’re drinking) (actually says hey, what’s wrong with me; mistranslation)
- (In special edition ep 2, WWX says “to come early is not as good as to come in time,” referenced again in ep 37)
- We killed the aqua demon **today**—so library>biling lake>drinking>Yin Iron happens in like 3 days
- In later ep (36?) LWJ says he’s never tasted Emperor’s Smile, but he has—but under the spell so doesn’t really count?
- I bet no one thought someone high and mighty like you would one day follow my lead (bad bg music though :/ )
- WWX toast to LWJ: *May we never forget what is worth remembering, or remember what is best forgotten.*
- LXC says **a few days ago** I took some students to Biling Lake… 
- [You are one of the people I approve. And I wanna be friends.](https://youtu.be/sCwJaqV23Xc?t=1219) A lot of benefits come with being my friend.
- The tiny smile and nod from WWX at LWJ after he ties on the forehead ribbon and retrieves his sword
- Like this is THE MOST BLATANT wedding of all the weddings
- LWJ tugging WWX around by the ribbon like WWX does with the binding talisman
- “Wangji has been diligent since he was a boy, he would never fool around with Wei Wuxian.” —LQ, famous last words, meet your future nephew in law (literally RIGHT THIS MOMENT LWJ is marrying him in a cave 🤣)
- Hundreds of years ago when the Yin Iron was whole, the burial mounds was a celestial land
- WWX: if the Yin Iron can absorb natural energy, turn it into a good use / LWJ scolds him but Lan Yi thought the same

- JY and LWJ doing their first tag team to calm WWX the fuck down
- Calls him Wei Ying to break up the fight with fancy dude for dissing Yanli—right after the rabbit lantern, and the vow to stand always for justice and live without regrets. Which is after the ribbon in the rabbit ice cave too. 
- Calls him that again, next scene, at the punishment—thinks WWX is crying but he’s really poking ants 🤣🤣
- [THE ANTS](https://youtu.be/LIJboa3vbV0?t=1510)
- “After **half a year** together, can’t I say goodbye?”
- WWX so unhappy to hear they’re leaving

---
## Ep 9
- LWJ just lowkey reminding WWX of his insight, that the puppets aren’t dead
- WWX to JC: it was my idea, don’t blame LWJ

- WWX chain around his neck at the tree, neck bruised
- A-Yuan!! Too young to remember WWX and LWJ showing up together 😭

- WWX saying dancing fairy only attacked LWJ; LWJ looking at him; is it surprise because WWX clever enough to figure this out when he hadn’t?
- **Dichroa Red liquor of Yueyang** (so this is what LWJ drinks in ep 35/36)
- By Yueyang, WWX has changed clothes, neck healed; LWJ same robes tho
- How much time has passed??
- Big shift in LWJ through here; done playing it cool, done even trying to say boring and keep distant (until the broken leg part, haha, but arguably that’s about sparing WWX more notice/punishment from WC)

- “To attempt the impossible, do nothing until you achieve something.”
- WWX wanting to take the punishment from Uncle Jiang (but doesn’t understand when LWJ did the same)

- Special edition dialogue goes: don’t say things like that unless you mean it / unless… / what do you want to say? (LWJ wants to know)

---
## Ep 14
- Now they’re doing telepathy instead of silence spells 😂 
- When they do the telepathy can they hear every thought or only the “conversation”? 😆 
- Xuanwu digests spiritual cognition as well as human flesh—it’s LWJ who says it’s just like Yin Iron
- First diagetic Wuji, right?? Woohoooo

- Has the scruff after his research at WQ’s but not after seven days in a cave 🤣
- TOTALLY a kiss, look at that drawing on the bed

- Who is watching when JC comes off the mountain? Just a Wen soldier?
- **Three months later** 
- Thought he went to find you **in Lanling**

---
## Ep 20

---
## Ep 21
- WWX reputation as a untamed character 
- When WWX meditating, startles and reaches down to his waist for the spirit bag with the Yin Iron—so that’s what he’s reaching for too, in front of the leaders. Same gesture
- [image:025387F5-EF5D-4901-88E4-995B53DD58D3-1209-0000010770B88256/Screenshot 2023-01-22 at 1.07.36 AM.png]

- LWJ: “Things change. How could it be the same?”
- Says thank you to LWJ for Lan temperament techniques
- Not wicked tricks, crafty tricks

- Mianmian standing up for JY too 😭 
- LWJ and JY tag team to calm WWX the fuck down
- Qishan is as hard as an iron cask, but can be penetrated with water 
- Jin Guangyao is who hides LXC after Cloud Recesses burns 😭
- LXC: we’re fighting with our backs against the wall, no way back

---
## Ep 23
- Plum blossoms outside (and inside) the rooms in Qishan—**the plum normally blossoms in mid-winter during January and February when all flowers die and the land is pale in colour**
- LXC knows JGS and JGY are hunting anyone who knows anything about Yin Iron—Wen, Jin, or Jiang (so knows there’s a threat to WWX, and LWJ by proxy)

- Jingyi calling JL Young Mistress Jin (wasn’t there to hear WWX the first time, so who picks it up from the other?)

- SZ has a finger tattoo! 😆

- LWJ saying suibian, “whatever,” when WWX is worried about how he’ll have to bluff 
- In YT version: “I’m just afraid of losing you face.”
- Is that Bacao, the maid from eps 45/46 behind Qin Su?
- WWX already in the food before JGY can make his speech

## Ep 42
- LXC: Gusu disciples were on a night hunt **in Yiling** when they passed Mo’s Manor…
- LWJ: hands off. Su She: *you* should keep your hands off 😂 
- Su She not back on his bullshit—he stays on his bullshit
- So sacrifice summon was a Yiling-laozhu idea? Or maybe with his manuscripts, bc something obscure he found? In Wen manuscripts? Collab w WQ? Or actually a Jin document but trying to pin it on him?
- Good memory: remembers what LWJ asked him in Cloud Recesses
- In special edition it’s “trust” instead of “believe in”
- “Lan Zhan, you fuddy-duddy,” with great affection when LWJ won’t leave his side
- According to the book, curse mark on his leg is lifted by the time he’s stabbed
- NHS has the body, so this is when he puts it in the temple coffin??

- His lip split by the time they arrive @ Burial Mounds
- “This body of mine lacks spiritual power”
- Jin Chan, the little brat who was trying to beat up Jin Ling, is the one mouthing off in the cave 😂
- JL tells him to shut up when he’s attacking WWX 
- “They haven’t come back in days…” —but has it really been that long? It’s Jingyi, who would say that after 15 min

- WWX saving JC with the flute when his powers go 😭 
- WWX saving JC and LWJ saving LQ 😭 
- SZ saving everybody by realizing there’s a magic circle in the cave (and then the juniors backing him up)
- LQ mending the magic circle
- LQ draws his sword on WWX 
- JL says still have spiritual power after trapped there for **two days** (if LWJ and WWX stop in Yiling, and maybe elsewhere, there is time for the jrs to get kidnapped after they leave CR)
- WWX to Su She: who are you? 😆
- The juniors all doing the Q&A with WWX like they would during night hunts 😭 
- WWX’s face @ “who dares to drink the water in burial mounds?”
- LWJ silencing Su She so WWX can talk 🤣 
- Blame the silence spell as WWX wicked trick, but no it’s Lan — more of the gray area 
- WWX asks LQ a question, LQ tells him to ask LWJ
- LWJ watching LQ listen to WWX
- Jingyi talking back to LQ?? During Su She interrogation 
- At second siege—they can tell their spiritual power is weak (pulse) but looks like only the doctor can say if golden core still intact

## Ep 46

- Flashback of saving a-Yuan; **the same day** the Wens were captured and killed
- So LWJ @ Burial Mounds x2? Goes to find WWX, finds a-Yuan instead; then goes back for siege after WWX dies
- First thing WWX does is defend JC to LWJ, which hits so different for LWJ now that LWJ KNOWS 
- The right time for lotus seeds — usually early harvest is July–Aug, late harvest is Oct–Nov

- You know now that i watched this episode again Wei Ying has clouds on his clothes. You will see it when they are playing music together and at the very end. It is so sweet I think that is the production guys way of doing the wedding thing like in the novel. Just a way to hide it from censorship made me cry though.

## Translation notes
- Courtesy name 
- Cloud Recesses also translated “Where the Clouds Retreat”
- Hanguang Jun, also /one who possesses the light/
- Bichen, also “Eluding the Dust of the Mortal World”
- Liebing is the name of Lan Xichen’s flute. The name means Cracked Ice
- Btw Lan Yuan (愿) means “wishes” and Lan Si Zhui (思追) means “miss you and chase you”, so basically Si Zhui is a love letter to Wei Ying from Lan Zhan
- *chenqingling*, anything from “a song to explain myself” or “a song of past relationships” or “a song to command the world”
- *chenqing*… to lay out my feelings, *to reveal myself fully*, to express the song of my heart …
