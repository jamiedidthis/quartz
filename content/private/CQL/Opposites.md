In my epic “oops this is supposed to be 5k words now it’s 50k words and basically a two-part novel” Untamed fic, I’ve been stumped on the end of chapter one for at least… six months now. 

Even getting *there* was ‘round my elbow to get to my nose, since I started with chapter 2 (Xuanwu cave) {% include marginnote.html marginnote="This was supposed to be the whole fic, the cave bit but from LWJ’s perspective, and then I was like, oops, I think they’re going to kiss—does it make sense that they’d kiss??? So then I wrote chapter 1, and then the whole scope of the fic changed, but then they accidentally kissed in chapter 1 also (OOPS, SURPRISE), so now I had to bridge between the two and make it make sense" marginnoteID="xuanwu" %}
