This is just what I was in the mood for, a 300+ chapter, 6000+ page sapphic slow burn court intrigue. The prose (and/or translation?) is more functional than beautiful on a sentence level, but on a plot level, with the overall character arcs, it’s mad skill. Especially when the author was writing as she went, chapter by chapter, serial style. 

Every time I thought we’d reached a point where it was going to drag, nope, there’s a twist, a plot development, a time skip. Never a dull moment, which is more than I can say for most 100-page books, much less any clocking in at this massive length.

Of course it helps that I am gaga for complex court politics played out at this scale. And morally gray (to put it kindly) heroines.

- If you’re gonna do a romance where one (nearly both) of the protagonists is underage at the beginning, then a 20-year timespan is the right choice to make
- The crown is detrimental to the happy ending 
- The way the stress ruins Qi Yan’s health is so much more relatable and satisfying than the superhero protagonists who sail through unscathed
