This is just what I was in the mood for, a 300+ chapter, 6000+ page sapphic slow burn court intrigue. The prose (and/or translation?) is more functional than beautiful on a sentence level, but on a plot level, with the overall character arcs, QJMX has some mad skill. Especially when she was writing as she went, chapter by chapter, serial style. (Says me, who can’t plot my way out of a paper bag.)

Every time I thought we’d reached a point where it was going to drag, nope, there’s a twist, a plot development, a time skip. Never a dull moment, which is more than I can say for most 100-page books, much less any clocking in at this massive length.

Of course it helps that I go nuts for complex court politics played out at this scale. And morally gray (to put it kindly) heroines.

A few more thoughts in list form:

- If you’re gonna do a romance where one (nearly both) of the protagonists is underage at the beginning, then a 20-year timespan to get to the happy ending, with a complete flip of power balance, is the right choice to make
- Hurrah! It does the thing I love where obtaining the throne is not the happy ending—it’s detrimental to the happy ending, a problem to be solved
- The way the stress ruins Qi Yan’s health is so much more relatable and weirdly gratifying than the superhero protagonists who sail through plots unscathed
- There’s an absolutely bonkers side plot where QY offs a lecherous prince by kidnapping the young man he’s been aggressively harassing, drugging the young man, covering him in a poison that interacts with the liquor in the prince’s system (he’s an alcoholic) and makes the prince drop dead at first kiss. The extensive groundwork is laid for this, it’s a two-birds-one-stone solution to a problem, and it’s non-con as hell, but I was so far in the suspended reality of this book that I was equally impressed and appalled by the creativity. 😆
