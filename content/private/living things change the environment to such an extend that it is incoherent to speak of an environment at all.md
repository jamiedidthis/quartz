Lovelock’s and [[authors/lynn margulis|Lynn Margulis’s]] central insight was that living things change the “environment” to such an extent that it is incoherent to speak of an environment at all; Gaia is the open, interlocking biotic systems that determine her condition. Stengers admits that “Lovelock perhaps went a bit too far in affirming that this processual coupling ensured a stability.”
