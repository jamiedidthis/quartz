Hi! I’m [[info|Jamie]], and this is part scratchpad, part library, part second brain, a repository of whatever I’m reading or learning at the moment, evolving as I do.

I think in [[notes/bottom-up processors are associative thinkers|nonlinear fashion]], so the content is more of [[notes/rhizomatic thinking is non-hierarchal and relational|a web of connections]] than a chronological blog. Choose your own adventure—there’s no wrong place to start.

## About me 👀

I’m a freelance graphic designer, [[notes/vocateur|vocateur reader]], [[notes/an amateur is one who loves|an amateur is one who loves]] writer, artist, and book collector living in rural NC. The <a href="/books" class="internal-link">book collection</a> here is actually highly incomplete, find me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/jamieharris) for the more extensive (yet still not exhaustive) list. I also occasionally appear on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/jamiedidthis) when I’m not in hibernation.

## Field guide 🌳

Internal wiki-type links are [[notes/we are wiggles|underlined]], external links are [bold text](https://theuselessweb.com/). You can browse by <a href="/tags" class="internal-link">tags</a> (for <a href="/notes" class="internal-link">notes</a>) or by <a href="/genres" class="internal-link">genres</a> and <a href="/shelves" class="internal-link">shelves</a> (for <a href="/books" class="internal-link">books</a>). Tags are different than genres or shelves—it’s the only way I could make the book sorting work—so it doesn’t hurt to look <a href="/tags/pleasure-and-play/" class="internal-link">both</a> <a href="/shelves/pleasure-and-play/" class="internal-link">places</a> for a topic.

Books can also be sorted by <a href="/authors" class="internal-link">author</a>, <a href="/publishers" class="internal-link">publisher</a>, and <a href="/series" class="internal-link">series</a>.

My spoiler policy for books is haphazard at best, but occasionally I will tag for a particularly spoilery bit. If you see redacted text like the following, you can click to spoil yourself. %%It was a ghost all along! 👻%%

## A working philosophy 🍄

There’s actually 2+ years of brainstorming and philosophy behind this fairly simple site. I was burnt out on the social feed, but also frustrated by the chronological demands of a blog. I wanted something book-centric, partially inspired by Mandy Brown at [A Working Library](https://aworkinglibrary.com/), but even more [[notes/rhizomatic thinking is non-hierarchal and relational|interlinked]] and [[notes/linguistic play as a writing exercise|informal]]. I started mapping how I read, think, and write (lots of links, citations, and lots of [cf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf.)’s), and started from scratch about a dozen times over to figure out a system that works for me.

My goal is that eventually, there won’t be a dead end, and each note and book will link to another. An endless network of trails to wander down and get lost.

## Back-end workflow 🍑

[Bear](https://bear.app/) gets all my raw thoughts, dumped in there like a junk drawer. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) gets my edited, slightly-more-comprehensible notes. This site is built on [Quartz 3](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/releases/tag/v3.3), which then takes the markdown notes from Obsidian and generates a  [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based static site, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jamiedidthis/quartz). 

Huge thanks to Jacky Zhao for [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)[^1], even though I customized the heck out of all the layouts and taxonomies. 😊

[^1]: [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is even more impressive, but I’m stuck with v3 for now due to how well Hugo suits my needs.
