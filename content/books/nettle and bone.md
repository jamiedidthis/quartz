So this is everything a fairy tale should be. The only thing that didn’t work for me 100% was the romance side plot, but it was very sweet nonetheless, and I do understand that’s a common ingredient in fairy tales, and that for most it would be necessary. Everything else was \*chef’s kiss\*, top notch, especially Bonedog and the chickens and how the gravewitch and the fairy godmother got to ride off into the sunset. (I was way more invested in their happy ever after than Marra and her knight. Oops.)
