This was so close to being great. SO CLOSE. But overall, the book felt kind of like the menagerie on board the ship, let loose in all directions, refusing to be corralled. There were some structure/plot/writing choices that left me more stumped than dazzled. Maud’s and Violet’s POV seemed really interchangeable for the first half, which is... not great when one is a supposedly scandalous, sardonic, shrewd actress and one is a sheltered, capricious, stubborn young girl.

The biggest gap in logic for me the whole time: they’re sending MAUD on this transatlantic mission of life and death importance? Who… checks notes… has no experience, no training, no actual qualifications other than being Robin’s sister, supposedly no magic…  

Just… WHAT. Especially when they have Adelaide or others like her in the ministry who would be smashingly competent and trustworthy?

I know Maud wanted adventure, but come on. That stressed me out.

Anyway, I have another theory for why this series, despite some high points, has been rocky for me so far… book 3 will have to confirm or deny. What worked for me completely was Hawthorn and Ross butting heads in the background, so I’m cautiously optimistic.

_Spoiler alert: since I’m so behind on posting these reviews, I’ve already read [[books/A Power Unbound|book 3]], and theory is confirmed._
