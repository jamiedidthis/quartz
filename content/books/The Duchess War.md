Finally I didn’t bounce off a Courtney Milan! Granted, the [Norfolk Southern disaster](https://perfectunion.us/ohio-railroad-disaster-explained/) had me in the mood to read about labor organizing, and that part worked for me better than the romance. 

(In theory, I liked Minnie and Robert together, but they didn’t make me *feel* it, you know. Also, it left a lot on the table re: Minnie being raised for twelve years as a boy.)

But the radical fantasy of a duke working from within to abolish the peerage—too many duke-centric romances haven’t dared to go that far. If you’re writing a fantasy, go all the way.
