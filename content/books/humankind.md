On [[authors/thomas hobbes|Hobbes]] v. [[authors/jean-jacques rousseau|Rousseau]], Bregman sides clearly with Rousseau. I’m more of a mind with *[[books/the dawn of everything|The Dawn of Everything]]*, wondering what we’re excluding by limiting ourselves to that binary. But I also think a little Rousseau-ism is a necessary and overdue corrective. It’s like when there’s a virus, so an antibiotic is needed, but then a return to healthy gut flora is this other third thing.
