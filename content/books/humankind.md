On Hobbes v. Rousseau, Bregman sides clearly with Rousseau. I’m more of a mind with [[books/the dawn of everything]], wondering what we’re excluding by limiting ourselves to that binary. But I also think a little Rousseau-ism is a necessary and overdue corrective. It’s like when there’s a virus, so an antibiotic is necessary, but then a return to healthy gut flora is this other third thing.
