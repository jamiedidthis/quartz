What even is Otava Heikkilä’s brain? There are nuns and orgies and authoritarian patriarchal tentacle gods, and it maps completely onto the experience of being outcast in our world, for simply being true to yourself. As with *[[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]]*, the images are more powerful than words. There are two pages I kept flipping between: Aru thrown off the mountain, then surrounded by the rest of the broken, unfit exiles, arriving to carry them home.
