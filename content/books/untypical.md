Part memoir of a late-diagnosed autistic person (straight white British male version); part comprehensive outline of accommodations that would make the world a safer, more autistic-friendly place. Some are so laughably trivial that it’s shameful they even have to be requested in the first place—but alas, that’s the world we live in. A good entry into the burgeoning autistic memoir genre, and a great resource for anyone wanting to better understand the autistic people in their life. (Because everyone has an autistic person in their life, whether they know it yet or not.)
