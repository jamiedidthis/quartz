This should have been book 1! Or I should have done my typical thing of reading out of order and started here! The _one_ time I try to be responsible and read a series in order, this is what happens.  
  
Technically, these are “twin novellas,” but IMO, Mokoya is the emotional core of the story, followed by Rider, and Akeha in *[[books/the black tides of heaven|Black Tides]]* is an interesting prequel. Everything about this one is an emotional knockout, especially the way it deals with grief and love. It had me in tears by the end. In a good way.  
  
Also, thankfully I have the paperbacks because I want to display these covers like the masterpieces they are.
