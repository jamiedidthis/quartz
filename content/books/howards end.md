At least this one holds up to my initial perception; it’s still my least favorite of the Forster novels.* The energy and wit are a feast for the senses, especially in the dialogue, but it’s so much about England and Empire, it gets, dare I say… tiresome? Perhaps only because we know how Empire turns out.  
  
But to write it when he wrote it? Dude. So basically, [what my friend Kat says in her review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/160803351): “I really liked it just until the last few chapters, when I only liked it. But I still love Forster for all the things he does well, especially for when he did them. I feel we may be kindred spirits on the astral plane.” Yes.
