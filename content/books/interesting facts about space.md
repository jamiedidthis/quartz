Me \[page 1]: I’m worried I read too much about [[notes/autism|ASD]] into *[[books/everyone in this room will someday be dead|Everyone in This Room Will Someday be Dead]]*. This time I’m gonna look for all the ways it’s not autism. I will counteract my bias.  
Me \[page 20]: This is autism.  
Me \[page 25]: This is autism.  
Me \[pages 26–239]: THIS IS AUTISM.  
Enid’s therapist \[page 240]: diagnoses her with PTSD, anxiety exacerbated by her disability (Enid is deaf in one ear), and refers her to a specialist for, wait for it… AUTISM  
Me: I FUCKING KNEW IT 😭🥰  
Enid \[page 259]: “I am crying more than the situation calls for.”  
Me \[page 259]: I am crying more than the situation calls for.  
Me \[page 270]: more tears  
Me \[pages 297-302]: crying and laughing now too  
  
There’s a reason I tag these books as comfort food. (Even though technically it would be more hurt-comfort, I guess.) (No, I think it’s just pure and regular comfort.) Emily Austin, thank you for putting them into the world.
