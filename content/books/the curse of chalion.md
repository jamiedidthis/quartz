It’s been easier lately for me to review the books I don’t like than the ones I do, because the ones I do, it’s just love, love, love. And it’s often difficult to articulate why.

This is one of the above. I just loved the… _gentleness_ of it. The kindness and the intelligence. The storytelling. The theology. It unfolds at its own pace and yet doesn’t get boring because the characters are so good. I wanted to dwell in this world as long as I could, and I also couldn’t put the book down; the ultimate dilemma of the reader, and the ultimate compliment to the writer. I foresee re-reading this one and its sequels and the rest of Bujold’s oeuvre many, many times.
