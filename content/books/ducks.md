Reading this alongside a friend who grew up in Alberta around the oil sands… oof. (Who has also been an internet friend since back in the livejournal/Hark! A Vagrant era.) It’s universal by being so specific. It’s also more dystopian than some dystopias I’ve read, yet done with nuance and empathy. Nothing but respect for Kate Beaton, and nothing but heartache for the devastation wrought (environmental, economic, cultural, communal, personal).
