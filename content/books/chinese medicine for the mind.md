Receiving the ARC for this one did its trickâ€”I ordered a copy once it was published. The sections on insomnia, anxiety (shaking exercise!), and trauma are especially helpful. Instead of isolating a few neurochemicals, it approaches the body and mind as a whole.

(Note: the type is quite small in the print edition. If vision is an issue the ebook may be better.)
