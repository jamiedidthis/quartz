Sometimes when things connect, they really connect. I picked this up because I was ready for another Bujold, and this is what the library had, and what is right there when I open it up? Renaissance Italy! Borgias, Florentines; Sforzas, Medicis; Guelphs and Ghibellines.  
  
Three true things: itâ€™s a gem in the rough; Thur is my boy; every Bujold, even vintage Bujold, is the best Bujold.
