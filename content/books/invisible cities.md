Still my least favorite Calvino, strange as that may seem when many people rank it his best. Let’s take it for granted that I’m weird and they’re right. It suffers more this time from _[[books/kalpa imperial|Kalpa Imperial]],_ which has much the same vision but with people included. I look forward to when I return to it one day and find it’s finally my book.
