So we’re completely changing protagonists AND writing style AND partially the genre too? Hell yes! Basically it’s the official report on the fallout of the [[books/the red threads of fortune|second book]], done epistolary style (with redactions!), introducing major revelations of its own.  
  
Loved it. Definitely doesn’t stand on its own—don’t start here. And the covers are still BOSS.
