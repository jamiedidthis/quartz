Sublime. Carefully constructed, nuanced, warmly empathetic, passionately human, complex. If you want a rose-colored ideologue that purports to fix problems with simplistic utopias, look elsewhere. If you want an accounting of our society’s ills, and alternatives that are just as complicated and imperfect, you’re in the right place. She doesn’t shout, preach, or point, just shifts the frame of reference in order to examine our assumptions. Each word choice has weight. Quiet, lovely, and profound. And just as timely now, nearly 50 years later.
