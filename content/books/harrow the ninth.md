Amount of times this book made me cry: \[redacted]. It is a sum equal to or only slightly less than the amount of times it made me cackle, gasp, and yelp.

> “I cannot behold that apocalypse, Harrow. I think you are one of the only Lyctors who can really and truly understand _apocalypse_… It is not a death of fire. It’s not showy. You and I would almost prefer the end if it came as a supernova. It is the inexorable setting of the sun, without another hope of morning.”
