Necromancy, assassinations, prison breaks, poisonings, stabbings (so many stabbings!I), pranks on Michelangelo… dude lived a _life_. Come for the adventure, stay for the fascinating glimpse into Renaissance life and art. I read because [[authors/lois mcmaster bujold|Bujold]] based part of _[[books/the spirit ring|The Spirit Ring]]_ on Cellini and said fact was stranger than fiction… she was not wrong.
