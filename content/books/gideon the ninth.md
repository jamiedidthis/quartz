WOULD HAVE HARROWHARK’S BABIES.  
  
I mean, it’s a good thing I like nice people in real life, because in fiction, Harrowhark is 10000% my type.  
  
And just, 10/10 on working through your Catholic upbringing by writing meme-filled fic about blood sacrifice and redemption and necromancy and lesbian saints and cavaliers. Muir is a genius and should be protected at all costs.
