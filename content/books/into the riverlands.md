Our traveling cleric Chih wanders into a wuxia novel, crossing paths with a pair of martial sisters and a polyamorous triad of rogue cultivators (MORE FANFIC ON THAT PLS!). It‚Äôs a road trip novella, replete with multiple stories within a story, rumination on reality vs. myth, and Almost Brilliant being brilliant. Right after Nghi Vo writes all the [[books/on the fox roads|queer Jazz Age fanfic]] for me, she can write all the wuxia for me too. üòçüòç And actually, reverse those priorities‚ÄîI‚Äôll take the wuxia first, please.
