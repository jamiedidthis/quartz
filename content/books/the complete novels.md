My aunt Brenda gave me this edition in 2007, and it’s the copy I use for all my annotations, so I can flip back and forth between books easily. The introduction by Karen Joy Fowler favors the Hollywood Jane much more than [[books/jane austen the secret radical|the political Jane]], and she gets some things flat out wrong (like claiming the quote about Emma, “a heroine no one by myself will much like,” is from Austen herself, when we have no record she said it). 

The [[publishers/everyman’s library|Everyman’s Library]] editions are the books I first read, back in the day. You can see my full commentaries there. But for reasons both practical and sentimental, I treasure this edition too.
