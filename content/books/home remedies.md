A collection of short stories, of which my favorite (of course it is, since diving is my favorite sport of the summer Olympics) is the pair of Olympic-level divers, trained to be each otherâ€™s shadow, one in unrequited love with the other. Sharp writing, skillful stories of China and its diaspora.
