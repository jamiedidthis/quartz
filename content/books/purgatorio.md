Reading this alongside Guido Ruggiero’s *[[books/the renaissance in italy|The Renaissance in Italy]]* is A+ recommended. Once again, vastly more interesting than my first exposure, where school curriculum wanted it read like it was _Pilgrim’s Progress._ I needed the Bondanella introduction back then to dispense with the nonsense: “Such allegorical abstractions are simply not what Dante’s great poem is all about.”
