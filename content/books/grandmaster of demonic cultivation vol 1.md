Back when I first read this, only the first Seven Seas volume had come out in the US. I thought I could just dip my toe in, get the gist, no harm done. I’d only read [[books/heaven official’s blessing vol 1|one other xianxia]] at that point and it was by the same author, so I’d just read others in the meantime to have more points of comparison by the time I got around to evaluating MDZS as a whole.

Well, jokes on me, because I read the fan translation, then another fan translation, then forgot to ever *stop* watching *[[notes/cql meme post i|The Untamed]]*, and by the time we had all five volumes in print I could speak no more rationally or coherently about it
