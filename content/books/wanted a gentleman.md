She had me at “gothic novelist” and “lonely hearts columnist.” This is wonderful. I love it when Charles just unleashes her id.

Note: I’m including the epilogue *Wanted, an Author*, in which Corvin from *[[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]]* makes a cameo and Theo’s gay gothic erotica novel *Jonathan: or The Struggles of Virtue* is at the top of my list for books-within-a-book that I most need to read.

(At least *[[books/the henchmen of zenda|Zenda]]* gives us the henchmen HEA, and *Jonathan* shows up again in *[[books/a noblemans guide to seducing a scoundrel|A Nobleman’s Guide to Seducing a Scoundrel]]*.)
