Speaking of [[books/proper english|sapphic murder house mysteries]], Alexis Hall has the contemporary version on lock.  
  
There are few things I like more than an established relationship romance—so very difficult to do well—and here it’s a marriage very naturally on the rocks for very relatable, natural reasons, just the living of life and complexities that ensue. That grounds the absolutely bonkers story going on around it, where there’s a blizzard and a castle in Scotland and organized crime and bodies dropping like flies, and a supporting cast straight out of Clue. (Spotting those shoutouts throughout the book was a treat.)  
  
You can take your pick of what book you want out of this: a gothic Christie-esque mystery, a be-gay-solve-crimes murderino podcast in book form (the main character Liza is the host of just such a podcast), a madcap homage to Clue, or the lowkey romance of two lovers rekindling their relationship. All of them are fantastic, and woven beautifully together, and a treat to partake of.
