Non-negotiable: read [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer’s]] five-part (plus?) [series on Machiavelli](https://www.exurbe.com/machiavelli-s-p-q-f/). I’ll wait. She makes sense of the enigma, the real Machiavelli, neither lionized nor maligned. The brave thinker; the frightened statesman. Charismatic, unorthodox, forming a response to the Borgia tyranny, trying to save his beloved Florence, playing pranks on the monks, centuries ahead of his time.  
  
It’s the reason I read this book again. I liked it the first time; the context, of which I had grasped only part, makes it even more remarkable now.  
  
Although credit where due: the introduction to this translation does a fair attempt at that context. It’s too Borgia-lite to paint the full bloody picture, but it has Savonarola right there on the first page, so it’s on the right track.
