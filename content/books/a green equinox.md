Sometimes you’re just in the mood for moody, queer af British novels with all the fraught gender politics and literary melodrama of the 1970’s. What can I say! So odd and compelling, like a fever dream. (Often literally, as there is an outbreak of typhoid that infects the course of the story.)

No regrets for picking up this pretty little McNally Edition either, which, apart from the banging cover, is a tactile pleasure to hold. It’s my favorite trim size, more tall than wide, with generous line-height and margins, but not so much that it pads out the page count and makes you feel cheated. Graphic design is my day job, but if I were a publisher, these are the specs I would choose.
