Verdict still stands after book three: would have Harrowhark’s babies.

The end of [[books/gideon the ninth|Gideon]] had some pacing things, the start of [[books/harrow the ninth|Harrow]] had some pacing things; Nona was the one I barreled through in 1.5 days because I could not put the book down. Based on that, I was going to deem book three my favorite, at least until book four appears. 

But then I went back through the pages where I had big feelings, and 9/10 of them were from Harrow. (Did NOT have Ortus making me cry on my Locked Tomb bingo card. ORTUS!) 

Soooo, now the latter half of book two might prove to be my top fav. Or book three. Or the whole of book two, when I reread. Or book three. 

Aaaah, we shall see. Or book four will just blast into existence and render all debate moot. 

Cannot wait.
