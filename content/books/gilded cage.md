Yes, this is Susan Lazarus from [[series/sins of the cities|Sins of the Cities]]. I love a prickly, ruthless heroine. I love jewel thieves and morality that is questionable at best. I love all that the most. This one didnâ€™t _quite_ click all the way with me despite all of the above, so I will be revisiting to see what I missed. Besides, femdom is too rare so any little hint of it is YAY.
