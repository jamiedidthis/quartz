The only thing I’ve had brain space for this week is Alexis Hall, and I say that as the highest compliment. He brings so much heart, joy, and snark even when he’s writing Sherlock Holmes fanfic with jilted vampires and witch kings and interstellar chicanery. Or should I say, *especially* when he’s writing Sherlock Holmes fanfic with jilted vampires and witch kings and interstellar chicanery.

Come for the fun, stay for the feels. The Alexis Hall special. Further proof there isn’t a genre he can’t write.
