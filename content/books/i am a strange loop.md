An excessively discursive book that just gets more and more sanctimonious as it goes? (Or stoned.) We parted ways strongly over the big-souled, small-souled, no-souled thing ([[notes/thinking people are stupid is the gateway drug to worse ideas|eeesh]])([[notes/the indigenous attribution of agency|also this]]), and he never won me back over. Given his other smug dismissals throughout the book, Iâ€™m sure heâ€™d say I missed the point, and Iâ€™m okay with that. I probably donâ€™t exist anyway. ðŸ™‚
