I didn’t love this quite as much as [[books/a lady's guide to scandal|book two]]. (Read them out of order, oops!) Lots of promise, but I think the difference in POV—floating omniscient instead of tight third—didn’t work quite as well for me, possibly because it’s such a high bar of difficulty, possibly because it’s much closer to Jane Austen’s voice, which means the differences in quality are glaring. Really though, it’s probably just because the MMC goes full Darcy, and I miss Max. And Margaret!
