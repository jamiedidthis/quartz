Reading nonfiction like fiction
Definitely not the binary of Rousseau vs. Hobbes

There’s a lot of repetition and rambling, but the gist is: ask better questions. Look at a problem with new eyes, rethink assumptions, ask if there aren’t more interesting and important questions we could be asking? 

For example: trying to locate the so-called “agricultural revolution” means we look only for the traits we expect and overlook anything that doesn’t conform. We’re not looking for play, or seasonal variations of social structures, or the essential involvement of women, so that has been left out of the story. 

I co-sign all of that. I also co-sign overturning this false binary of Hobbes v. Rousseau, like those are the only two options. Selecting either one of those as our origin myth is like having a Garden of Eden, there was once some “original state” more natural than the rest. It’s a false premise, a false binary, helpful once upon a time to shake out some older ideas, but now it’s getting us nowhere.

A lot of the negative reviews seem to want a new level of certainty, backed up by Facts™, and I can’t help but think that’s missing the point of the book. We’ve been certain for a long time, and we’ve been wrong. It’s time for some curiousity and speculation, and a return to the humus.

Stray notes: 
- Adopting either Hobbes or Rousseau as an origin myth is like having a Garden of Eden, there was once some “original state” more natural than the rest. A false premise, a false binary.
* “Inequality” is almost a fatalistic acceptance, some condition that can only be tweaked instead of ended (kings or governments can be overthrown, a vague notion cannot).
* This different view of the past is basically [[notes/science fiction futures|science fictional behavior]].
* Seasonal variations of social structure (reminds me of seasonal gender in [[books/the left hand of darkness]]
* Schismogenesis
* Also seasonal flooding with flood retreat farming, cf. [[notes/seasonal time]],
* When we tell these stories of losses of primordial innocence, women get written out of the picture, cf. [[notes/carrier bag theory of fiction]].
* History’s first city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the environment, or on each other
* I was keeping an eye out for Alfred Kroeber’s work (it’s there, first referenced on page 199, the 378!), but they do me one further and cite [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Le Guin]] herself, specifically ‘The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas’.
