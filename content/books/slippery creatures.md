My favorite KJ Charles yet.

I should probably wait till the end of the trilogy to make declarative statements, but there’s WWI spies and bookshops and gentle friendship despite odds and this is as far into my wheelhouse as you can get until, like, sheep herding or Belgium is involved. Oh wait, Belgium is involved. It’s my favorite plot structure too, and my favorite types of characters. Not sure who I like best, actually: Will, Kim, Phoebe. (It’s Will, but the others do have a chance at the title, which says something.)

So, yes. Her best yet, my favorite yet, and I say that as someone who just re-read *[[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]]*. I can’t wait for more.
