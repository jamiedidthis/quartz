Just what I wanted for October: brilliant gothic fanfiction of *The Fall of the House of Usher* with even more fungi than Poe. Creepy and exquisite, and thatâ€™s not just the cover art.  
  
(With a bonus Beatrix Potter relative, clever worldbuilding linguistics w/r/t gender, and a hat tip to Prisoner of Zenda!)
