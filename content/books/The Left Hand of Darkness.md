The David Mitchell foreword 
Picture if you will reading this book when it was published, 1969, the year of Stonewall

Gender, sex, romance, desire, power, nationalism, oppression… they’re all just stories we tell ourselves. And we can tell different stories if we choose. (Afterword, Charlie Jane Anders)

> Light is the left hand of darkness 
> and darkness the right hand of light.  
> Two are one, life and death, lying 
> together like lovers in kemmer, 
> like hands joined together, 
> like the end and [[Tao Te Ching|the way]].
