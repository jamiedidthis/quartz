When KJ Charles is on, she’s _on_. This book is all the things: fun, ridiculous, hilarious, swashbuckling, hot, FUN. The high pulp style suits her so well because she can pack the book full of joy and all the sneering and sniding she likes to write works because it’s comic and joyful.

On top of that: she upends the classic _Prisoner of Zenda_ and I love stories that do that. It never hurts to remember who writes the official accounts and what likely happened instead, even when it’s pulp fiction.

One of my favorites all year.
