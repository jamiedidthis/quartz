For the first half of this, it’s very much a sister-book to *[[books/the saint of bright doors|The Saint of Bright Doors]]*. If you didn’t like that one, you probably won’t vibe with this one. But if, like me, you loved *Saint*, then *Rakesfall* levels up and then some. More hallucinatory, more vertiginous. Deep time and myth cycles into the deep past and deep future. There was a point where I wasn’t even sure all the threads could tie together at the end, but holy hell, DID THEY. Chandrasekera is writing like no one else out there. Or if he is, PLEASE TELL ME, I want their books too.

Note: I don’t want to spoil anything because the book just needs to be experienced, but I really need to highlight this part: when one twist is that the trillionaire techbros have achieved their coveted immortality, but they must spend it trapped on the earth they’ve ravaged into oblivion… let’s just say that was cathartic AF.
