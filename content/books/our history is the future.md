An excellent re-issue of a book that's been on my to-read list since it first published in 2019. I'm glad it finally prompted me to get to it. Itâ€™s the history of two centuries of indigenous activism in the context of even broader indigenous exploitation and resistance, and it needs to be more widely known. The introduction alone, how water is kin, how rivers are sovereign beings who should be protected in their own right, not just for the way it affects our human health, should be read loudly and often.
