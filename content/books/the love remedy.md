I noped out hard at the kiss during a panic attack(!!!), and it never won me back. I did skim through the rest to find out whodunnit, which means I was annoyed by whodunnit (it’s just nonsensical based on the characterization within the book!), with bonus annoyance that there’s some minor kinkiness (yay blindfolds!) that goes completely to waste, ruined by the violation of trust that is the panic attack groping sesh. Thumbs up for the social commentary but not much else worked.
