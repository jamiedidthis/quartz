An argument against theories of social Darwinism that emphasize competition and survival of the fittest and against the romantic depictions by writers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who thought that cooperation was motivated by universal love. Instead Kropotkin argues that mutual aid has pragmatic advantages for the survival of human and animal communities and, along with the conscience, has been promoted through natural selection.

Kropotkin’s actual argument is far more interesting.[^1] Much of it is concerned with how animal cooperation often has nothing to do with survival or reproduction, but is a form of pleasure and play in itself. “To take flight in flocks merely for pleasure is quite common among all sorts of birds,” he writes. 

Life is an end in itself, etc.
