Truly grisly horror with a truly touching love story. Most fairytale retellings (here, *The Little Mermaid*) course-correct from the Disney versions back to Hans Christian Andersen territory. This overshoots Andersen by quite some distance, landing in the realm of rapacious colonizers and ghoulish Mengele-style war crimes. I loved the sharp teeth of it, literally speaking. And the little flame of hope and tenderness it cradled amongst the gore.
