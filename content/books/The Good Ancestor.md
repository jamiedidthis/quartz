Krznaric suggests a number of strategies, including:  
  
- “[[Deep time]]” mindset: thinking about the long-term consequences of our actions, and how they will affect the world in the millennia to come
- “Intergenerational dialogue”: having conversations with people from different generations and learning from their experiences and insights
- Aanticipatory governance”: taking a proactive approach to addressing long-term problems rather than reacting to them as they arise
