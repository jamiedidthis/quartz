This is a romance with two characters named Emma Woodhouse and George Knightley—and that’s where the resemblance to Jane Austen ends. A few more plot lines and characters sneeze in *Emma*’s direction, but it’s the Wikipedia summary version, none of the tapestry of complex characters with rich inner lives of their own, propelled by the roles society forces them to inhabit, who can’t be reduced to stereotypes like “country bumpkin” or “sleazy misogynist.” Instead of trenchant social commentary, we get fashion designers namedropped like glitter in a world where the Bates barely exist on page, while way more time is given to Knightley Capital (!!). That shifts the dynamics of the story beyond recognition. (And I’m sorry, but a gay hairdresser, greenwashing the investments of your [horny] venture capitalist, or taking a few swipes at nepotism does not a social commentary make.)

It’s the phenomenon that bothers me most in modern retellings, where what was subversive and fairly radical in Austen’s day is now old fashioned, so the point is missed entirely, and flattened into a generic HEA and token girlboss feminism, if not an outright regressive worldview. The Austen window dressing without the spirit, wit, or politics. (It works better if you say it’s a *Clueless* adaptation, but it still lacks the idealism of that one too, and the charm.)
