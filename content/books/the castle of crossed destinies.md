A lot of [[authors/ludovico ariosto|Ariosto]], a little of [[authors/giovanni boccaccio|Boccaccio]], a lot of Homer, Sophocles, and Shakespeare and a little of [[authors/dante alighieri|Dante]] too. Had I not been recently indulging in all of those authors, the story might have lost me, but now it’s just in good company. There’s even specific references to [[authors/marquis de sade|Sade]] that would have flown past me three months ago. So yes, this meta story on “the story that’s hidden in the warp of all stories” is, in Calvino fashion, a damn fine way to spend an evening. Everything does connect.
