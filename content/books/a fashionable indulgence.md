Ditto *[[books/a seditious affair|A Seditious Affair]]:* first read this years ago; out of order then in order; its politics are even more relevant now. There is a refreshing lack of drama between Harry and Julius—their conflict is external—and I greatly appreciate a romance with the guts to do that. Also, it plays out pretty much in tandem with _Seditious Affair_, so Dom falling apart in the background is like a basket full of easter eggs for those who know why.
