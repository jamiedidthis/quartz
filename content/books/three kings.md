Another for my collection of killer opening lines:

> _Ethan Shaw carried two knives, one for lilies, the other for veins._

And the book just gets better and better from there. It counters all my usual problems with [cozy witchy books](https://www.tor.com/2023/08/08/the-problem-with-small-town-witch-romances/), and sometimes [cozy fantasy in general](https://www.superdoomedplanet.com/blog/2023/02/26/on-travis-baldrees-legends-and-lattes/), not to mention the fraught subject of fertility. It’s full of lines that devastating in their quietness and truth.  

> _It was strange, sharing the silence with a man who’d always fit into his life like an organ, and a man who’d wandered into their home like a leak or a bear—capable of causing invisible damage or very real, very visible problems. That was the messiness, wasn’t it? The consequence that came with magic as intimate as necromancy._

There’s grief and loss too, and change, part of the messiness right along with love and hope. Just the vibe I want for a winter solstice read. Basically, everything about this little novella is exquisite, and what [M.E. Morgan](https://morlevart.com/) has done with the new cover art lives up to the gorgeousness therein.  

> _Ethan faced the moon again. He breathed because breathing seemed sensible; he wanted to remind himself it was possible to breathe right then, to inhale and exhale in the midst of change._
