One of the most accessible yet in-depth histories I’ve read. Lively and engaging. It’s been my tour guide through the past month of [[authors/dante alighieri|Dante]], [[authors/benvenuto cellini|Cellini]], [[authors/niccolo machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[authors/ludovico ariosto|Ariosto]], et. al. Highly recommended.
