Update: Yep. [[books/a noblemans guide to seducing a scoundrel|Second book]] delivers the very necessary half of the whole. I adored it, and now I adore this one on re-read. Everything that just felt a slight step off pace the first time was solved with a deeper, closer read, and the addition of Luke’s story. The pair of books together land firmly in the top of my KJC rankings, five stars and then some.

Original review:  
  
Wavering on the fifth star, and it’s only because I am so spoiled for choice with KJC, and have books (plural!) by her that have touched my soul, and this one didn’t _quite_ reach the upper tier of my rankings. I’ll be re-reading when book 2 comes out, and I’ll reassess then.  
  
But. But! What I loved, what _did_ touch my soul, is the Marsh. The setting, Romney Marsh, is basically a character in its own right, and it’s KJC at her brilliantest with the lush sense of place. Ever since she announced that was going to be the setting, I have been eagerly anticipating it, and every bit of it was what I hoped for and then some. The language, the natural history, the way it shapes the characters, I soaked it up.  
  
For example: Joss finally calling Gareth ‘Marshman’ was the more emotional scene for me, not the exchange of rings at the end. In fact, that may be one of the few things I bounced slightly off of: she hit more of the traditional regency romance beats, as one would for their first major trad-pub book (yay for that!), whereas my all-time faves are when she subverts more of those beats. (Think Kim and Will desperately trying to free themselves from an earldom, etc.)  
  
So yes. Thoughts! I have them! And feelings. Will see which wins out after book 2. (I’m betting on the Marsh.)
