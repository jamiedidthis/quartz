Bounced off it big time. I like the introduction, especially with Meg Jones Wall’s ex-evangelical background, but once she got to the cards, very little resonated. I feel at odds with her perspective and energy level, and not in a challenging, interesting way. I’ll stick with *[[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]]* and keep exploring.
