Great at painting a picture of 1st century Palestine. So many inaccuracies though! [[books/jesus apocalyptic prophet of the new millennium|Ehrmanâ€™s was better]].

## Pull quotes

> Nowhere is any such thing written: not in the Law of Moses, not in the prophets, not in the Psalms. In the entire history of Jewish thought there is not a single line of scripture that says the messiah is to suffer, die, and rise again on the third day, which may explain why Jesus does not bother to cite any scripture to back up his incredible claim. p. 177
