This book is good at: painting a more vivid picture of first century Palestine than most people are aware of. 

Also: introducing the conflict between Paul and the actual apostles (even if it does overreach a bit).

But ultimately way too many marks from my red pen where the info was wrong, and I’m not even a scholar, so I’m sure there are plenty more I missed. Bart Ehrman’s [[books/jesus apocalyptic prophet of the new millennium|Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]] is the much better scholarship.
