I love mythology turned feminist, but something about this was so on the nose that it didn’t quite pull me in. I may revisit in a different mood to see if I feel differently, or whether I’m comparing it unfairly to *[[books/home remedies|Home Remedies]]*, which was a better match to my taste in short stories.
