In my opinion, the definitive text. The Ursula K. Le Guin translation (and footnotes!) is everything. Nobody listens to language the way Ursula does. If *[[books/kalpa imperial|Kalpa Imperial]]* was an ideal pairing between text and translator, this is even more so.

From her introduction:

_“It is the most lovable of all the great religious texts, funny, keen, kind, modest, indestructibly outrageous, and inexhaustibly refreshing. Of all the deep springs, this is the purest water. To me, it is also the deepest spring.”_
