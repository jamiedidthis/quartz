“One might call society a game in the formal sense, if one bears in mind that such a game is the living principle of all civilization.”

Or: “In the absence of the play-spirit civilization is impossible.”

First published in Dutch, 1938, before the official outbreak of WWII. The Beacon Press book is based on the combination of Huizinga’s English text and the German text, published in Switzerland 1944. Huizinga died in 1945 (the year World War II ended).
