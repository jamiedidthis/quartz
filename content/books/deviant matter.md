It’s a bummer that I am so very interested in the premise of this, but the dense academic writing, chock full of jargon, makes it nearly inaccessible. It’s especially a bummer that for someone purporting to “queer the narrative,” it’s impenetrable to those without the author’s credentials. I liked the bits I gleaned from it, particularly the compostocene (cf. [[authors/donna haraway|Donna Haraway]]) and administrative violence (cf. [[authors/david graeber|David Graeber]]). I’m used to reading above my head, but this was one of the worst offenders in a while. I would have liked to like it more, had it not been written, as Graeber might say, for the cloistered elite. :/
