Maybe don’t read this over lunch like I did? By which I mean, it’s fanfic of *Sweeney Todd*, it’s grisly horror, and it’s very good and effective, because KJ Charles. She can write anything from [[books/band sinister|Georgette Heyer homages]] to penny dreadfuls and it’s worth the ink. I’d read more about all of these characters, especially Ingestrie, and he gets the least page time as any. Maybe not over lunch, though. Yeah, maybe not over lunch.
