Aah, this was so fun! It righted some wrongs from *Persuasion* (I’m not a Wentworth fan, okay—don’t @ me), and threw in enough hijinks that it didn’t have to be a faithful retelling. The only character I adore more than Melville is Margaret; I’m in love with them both. The only note I would give is that I personally wished Eliza would have been delighted that %%Melville fooled her%%; I get why she’s not, but it would have been a refreshing twist if she was like, “ok, now we’re soulmates, well done,” even if she still made him pay for it. But that’s just me.

The whole ensemble cast is great. The banter is top-notch. If I elope with Margaret or Melville (or both!), don’t come for me, ’kay?

> “Did you just cut me direct?”  
> Eliza turned quickly, to find Melville standing directly before her, head cocked. Her mouth fell open in horror.  
> “I—ah—” she stammered, her face growing hot.  
> “You did!” he crowed, intrigued and delighted.

(Also, if you’re going to illustrate a cover, that’s how to do it.)
