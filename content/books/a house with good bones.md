Yay, vultures save the day! A horror novel where racist grandmothers and roses are the problem, not the bugs and the vultures. That, along with the fantastic characters and very specific (and accurate!) North Carolina setting, makes this spooky book a treat.  
  
(Out of 247 pages, I have 152 highlightsâ€”mostly lols, entomologist rants, and perfect encapsulations of NC life.)
