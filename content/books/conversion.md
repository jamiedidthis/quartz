A 12th century missionary finds shelter in a blizzard with a gruff, kindhearted hermit. The conversion is his own, shedding the self-loathing shame for genuine tender romantic connection. Like with *[[books/shattered spear|Shattered Spear]]*, Heikkilä does so much with so little, spare art and spare dialogue packing a punch of emotions.
