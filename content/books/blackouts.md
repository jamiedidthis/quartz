All the different layers of meaning to the title—the blackouts our narrator experiences due to PTSD, the blackouts of Juan and his fading memory, the failure of institutional memory, the queer erasure from history, the literal blackouts of the pages of the book. It feels like a work of art, not just a novel. Indeed, if you’re looking for linear storytelling, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Lives up to the hype. Could not put it down. Experience the book in print form if at possible—the art is so integral to the story that it *is* the story.
