Infuriatingly and terrifyingly relevant. Like, up to this very day, where you couldn’t even update the book with current examples because there are too many to choose from. Venezuela, Syria, Iran. Ad infinitum. It’s all following the same script. Where you could argue the book is dated, that actually further proves its point, such as the west’s support and glorification of Putin thirty years ago when he fit their needs in a different way. It’s all narrative. And it’s all managed to achieve an end.

Some of these case studies have been swallowed by history and the news churn; others (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia) still beg for a reckoning. Thirty years later, the lies debunked here remain the official account. The past is the future. Every bit of truth helps.
