Here, let me sum it up for you:

> Money is pure narrative construct. Debt is pure narrative construct. These things only exist to the extent that we all collectively agree to pretend that the stories about them are true. We are free to collectively end that agreement and create a whole new system at any time. â€”[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], *[[books/notes from the edge of the narrative matrix|Notes from the Edge of the Narrative Matrix]]*
 
The fact that this point is bubbling up from multiple different sources in multiple different ways is ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥  (never forget: [[notes/any human power can be changed by human beings|any human power can be changed by human beings]])

Graeber has lots more ways to think about the past, present, and future through this lens!
