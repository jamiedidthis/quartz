The coincidence of snagging this series on sale[^1] the night before I finished *[[books/rakesfall|Rakesfall]],* where [[authors/vajra chandrasekera|Vajra Chandrasekera]] names Premee Mohamed in his acknowledgments. 

Indeed, it plays on similar themes, albeit in an entirely different style. Here weâ€™ve got an action-adventure race across the continents when Johnny, young super-genius inventor/do-gooder in a kind of Greta Thurnberg mold, accidentally creates such a powerful clean energy reactor that it warps space and time and calls up eldritch gods from the deepâ€¦ which she knows full well because sheâ€™s made a deal with those same gods to exchange her mortality for the fame and brains to save the world. Her best friend Nick is along for the ride, and through his eyes, itâ€™s a rumination on power and corruption, on complicity, on the fate of humanity in one young girlâ€™s hands. Cosmic horror (and smartass banter) at its finest.
