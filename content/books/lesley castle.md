I like [the goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/39627078) that says “So you think you are a writer. Read this slim volume and weep.” Austen did this at sixteen, and it’s unpardonably good for any writer, much less someone that young. The one fault of the slim volume is that it is indeed slim.  
  
If I were compiling it, though, I’d give the top billing to her History of England. The sketches, the parody, the rending of garments for Mary Queen of Scots; it’s near perfection.
