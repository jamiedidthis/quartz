Iâ€™m not averse to anachronisms in my historicals ([[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]], [[authors/lex croucher|Lex Croucher]], et al. can get away with ahistorical murder), but there is anachronistic, and then there is untethered from reality. This was the latter, and not in a fun way. The info-dumping, the choppy writing, the shallow girlboss feminism, the hypersexual internal monologues, the plentiful (and destitute) dukes,[^1] the chaotic plot and even more chaotic characters, all of it made me bail earlier than usual. I think Howard and I just may not vibe in our tastes or sense of humor.

[^1]: Either write a working man or go the [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]] route (*[[books/the duke at hazard|The Duke at Hazard]]*) instead of these gymnastics just to get duke in the title? Why?
