How do you write the unimaginable? How do you craft art from the horror? How do you count your loved ones, now dead, in lines of poems? 

I read this twice, once fast, once slow, and let it break me. 50 years of occupation and apartheid. Years of [[books/on palestine|incremental genocide]]; now a full year of genocide, full stop. A farce of an election in the US with both parties fighting over who can kill the most Palestinian children. Mosab Abu Toha is one more voice [out of millions](https://www.medialens.org/2024/everyone-in-gaza-is-sick-injured-or-both-israels-2-1-million-victims/), asking us to bear witness. [Gaza tells us who we are.](https://caitlinjohnstone.com.au/2024/11/05/gaza-tells-us-who-we-are/) Now what?
