A goofy, over-the-top farce with the volume dialed up to 11. Which seems *absurd* to complain about, given how I just read and loved *[[books/something extraordinary|Something Extraordinary]]*—surely if anything is dialed up to 11 it’s the Tarletons. But [[authors/alexis hall|Alexis Hall]] grounds his farce with deep emotion and intimacy, using it to scratch away at the actual farce of a society that dictates such rigid, preposterous roles. I feel Erica Ridley wanting to do something similar, but it stays at the superficial level, with ripped abs and lust at first sight and a relationship that’s just as conventional as you please, apart from a heroine with a sword. I applaud the found family and the chronic disability rep, but without deeper character work, this veers into cartoonish and (she winces) boring territory for me.
