Whoa. Masterful use of dialect and structure to deconstruct the traditional bounds of genre and narrative. The way the characters code-switch their way through multiple registers and languages—well-known and invented—is reflected in the way the novella flips through genres like a catalog, exposing the expectations and limitations of each. 

My own expectations were high due to [this essay by the author](https://reactormag.com/the-poc-guide-to-writing-dialect-in-fiction/) on linguistics and dialect, but the reality impressed me even more.

Linguistically and mythologically it’s a marvel.
