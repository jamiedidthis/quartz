“Has someone written a romance about pro cycling?” was something I wondered last week. And voila, this book.

It actually:  
- Has some legit knowledge of cycling!  
- Addresses doping as a plot point  
- Addresses the extremely monastic and high-pressure lifestyle  
- Gets the team dynamic!  
- Has real races like Paris-Nice!

However, it also:  
- Has its hero winning races in a way that kind of rider wouldn’t win races… unless he’s Peter Sagan  
- Makes the hero basically Peter Sagan  
- Except he’s American and has none of the qualities of Peter Sagan, superstar of the cycling  
  
Overall, I did:  
- Laugh at the name of our hero’s team, which is all-too-realistic in the wacky world of pro sponsors  
- Like the way it tossed in a to-be-continued at the end  
  
Although:  
- It to-be-continued before the Giro. I want the Giro!  
  
Although:  
- Why a sprinter is racing the Giro when his target is the Tour, I have no idea  
  
Although:  
- Maybe this is one of those series that switches protagonists, and the sequel is Tom Dumoulin at the Giro. If not, can I pitch that?  
  
Final verdict:  
- Kinda like real cycling, but not like real cycling, just like it’s kinda Peter Sagan but not Peter Sagan  
- I was entertained, and could nitpick, and really, that’s all a cycling fan wants

Edited to add: the origin of my curiosity was how one might handle the sexy hunk aspect when in reality, you do not want a cyclist to take off their kit. She does mention the tan lines! That’s a start!
