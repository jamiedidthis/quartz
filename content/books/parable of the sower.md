I loved the Earthseed parts of this (God is Change), but the dystopia parts went the way of most dystopias for me, almost too limited in its imagination? It also feels like only half of a whole, so I think thatâ€™s part of it too. Will revisit these feelings after _[[books/parable of the talents|Parable of the Talents]]_.
