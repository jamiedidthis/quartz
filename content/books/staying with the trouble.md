Drawing from the Greek roots khthon (earth) and kainos ([[notes/concepts of time|time]]), Haraway coins Chthulucene as an alternative to the monikers Anthropocene or Capitalocene as labels for these turbulent times. 

> The Anthropocene marks severe discontinuities; what comes after will not be like what came before. I think our job is to make the Anthropocene as short/thin as possible and to cultivate with each other in every way imaginable epochs to come that can replenish refuge.

She proposes a radically different worldview, once that is weird and messy and achievable in the face of current devastations. (Haraway uses the acronym SF throughout her book and traces its possible meanings: “science fiction, speculative fabulation, string figures, speculative feminism, science fact, so far…”)

She references, among others, [[authors/ursula k le guin|Ursula K. Le Guin]] ([[books/the unreal and the real|The Author of the Acacia Seeds]]) and [[authors/octavia butler|Octavia Butler]] (*[[books/parable of the sower|Parable of the Sower]]*) for their visionary exploration of narrative and biological sympoiesis. Whatever the future holds, the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked in tentacular practices, and will require sym-poiesis, or making-with, rather than auto-poiesis, or self-making.
