Choosing to interrogate the state of matrimony, I should have expected nothing less from Alexis Hall. I had to read this twice to really like it, because I am so urgggggh about weddings, and I needed the ending spoiled to get fully on board:

%%THEY DITCHED THEIR OWN WEDDING AT THE ALTAR WOOHOOO%%

 Plus, it borrows a pretty solid structure from *Three Weddings and a Funeral*, the CRAPP gang is back in action, and we start to see hints of the characters from [[series/material world|Material World]]. No complaints, once I knew the wedding train was not headed to the obvious destination.
