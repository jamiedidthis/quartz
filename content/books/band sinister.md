If this isn’t everything that’s wholesome and good in the world, I don’t know what is. A tribute to Heyer indeed; it just includes those who paint with oils outside conventional lines. It cranked my heart open without being saccharine or heavy. One of those books where I have to be careful what I read next because it might not measure up.

_Re-read May 2020:_

After reading Heyer’s *Venetia,* I was in the mood to remind myself how great this book is. I’ve sat up two nights in a row, working puzzles while listening to the audiobook, and I don’t think I could have picked a better way to spend time. It’s wholeheartedly lovely, and everything good in the world, and the dose of courage I needed.
