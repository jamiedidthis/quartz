Lex Croucher’s lols-per-page cannot be beat.

Weirdly, the only character I was meh on was the love interest, just because he’s _too_ perfect. (My notes say “Col Brandon in a Henry Tilney body???”) I also would have been fine if this had swung more towards a coming-of-age instead of HEA romance, but I won’t hold that against it. 

The mean girls stole the show! I loved them all.
