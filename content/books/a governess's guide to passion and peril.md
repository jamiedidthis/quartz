The fourth in a series, and I read at least one of the first three during the fugue state years when my dad’s health was failing, so I have only the haziest memory of it. That’s to my disadvantage, because it never felt explained in the text why the other women hadn’t come to Jane’s aid before now, nor why Jane’s feelings for Adrian would evolve beyond a schoolgirl crush. The plot is sketched out, not fleshed out—the side characters are props, the culprit is telegraphed from his first appearance on page, and both the mystery and the romance are a series of scenes that happen without much tension or suspense. One thing that bothers me in romance is when the couple gets together by default: i.e. they’re young, attractive, and available, so poof, they belong together. Versus being drawn toward someone against expectation or reason, and all the complexity and growth that entails. It manifests a lot more often in straight romance than queer romance, for obvious reasons, which is why these m/f historicals keep failing me, even when I’m just in the mood for fluffy distraction.
