A thief and a private investigator team up to solve a theft, and the vibes are basically a case-of-the-week tv episode (think *Charlie’s Angels*, *Remington Steele*, *White Collar*, etc) playing historical dress-up. The plot is as straightforward as it gets—they search for a [macguffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin), they get a clue, they get another clue, they solve the case. No twisty characters or [[authors/kj charles|KJ Charles]]-level plotting here. I was all set to breeze through it and enjoy myself regardless, and then a bad case of instalove reared its head, along with ye olde hardcore gender essentialism, the kind that bums me out and turns me off. For example, a memorable scene where Harry has to dress like a dandy for an undercover recon (an *Italian* dandy, at that), and the author takes great pains to assure us that, “On any other man, the ensemble would have looked ridiculous, almost feminine, but on *him* the flamboyant clothes only served to accentuate his intense masculinity.”[^1]

Sigh. That’s on me for reading outside my lane, but my hope for a quick, fun read with heists and spies didn’t pan out.

[^1]: Compare with, say, *[[books/trouble|Trouble]]*, and how Croucher writes the MMC ship captain, rugged masculinity without the baggage. I’d like to teach a class on the difference and why it matters.
