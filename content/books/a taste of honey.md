That ending! Talk about an ending that twists everything you thought you read for the previous 159 pages (I dare say, happily so).

Kai Ashante Williams [[books/the sorcerer of the wildeeps|messes with the genre bounds again]], melding psionics and telekinesis and Greek oracles as fluently as his languages. The only thing I missed was the wild linguistic experimentation of the first book, but this one is its own fantastic thing too.
