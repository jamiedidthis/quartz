Look, realistically, the destiny stuff did not work for me. They’ve known each other a handful of weeks; saying, “I really, really like you, we’re both hot messes, let’s try to make this work” would have been much more my speed.

But. I love Astrid Parker SO MUCH. She is my kryptonite, the cast iron bitch who can’t stop melting all over the place like the gooiest cinnamon roll. It would have meant SO MUCH to younger me to hold a book like this in my hands. 

So I don’t even care. Destiny-shmestiny. I loved it, flaws and all. _Astrid Parker._
