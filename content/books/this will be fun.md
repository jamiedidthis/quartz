[[authors/lex croucher|Lex Croucher]], this is not. This landed on the wrong side of cheesy for me, and whoever compared it to *The Princess Bride* should have to answer for themselves. It’s a second-chance romance twice over, with two different couples who seem better off apart (although the lesbian couple was marginally better). The writing is clunky in a way that I hope gets improved before the final publication. I often like to read new authors unawares, but had I looked up the three authors behind the pen name I would have known ahead of time that this wasn’t for me.
