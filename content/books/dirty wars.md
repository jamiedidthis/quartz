[Insert string of obscenities] at the things the United States has done. The best thing this book does is make it perfectly clear there isn’t right-wing or left-wing. It spans two crucial presidencies (Bush II and Obama), and the substantive difference is that the former worried how far they could push things and the latter did not care. Even now, another half-decade down the road, another two years into a disastrous presidency, the headlines we read and the stories we don’t are the fulfillment of the events in this book. What more can you say when it’s the Nobel Peace Prize-winning president who institutes Terror Tuesdays? What do you think the ones who come after will do?  
  
The enemies we do have in the world, we’ve made them. I take back what I said above; the best thing this book does is put you in their shoes.
