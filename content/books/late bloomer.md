In a way, it’s not the author’s fault that this book let me down. If you have characters named Pepper and Opal, set the book in NC, and give the front cover major Bess and George vibes, there’s no way I can restrain my imagination or my expectations. I had already head-canoned the book I wanted this to be, so when the real book fell short, the fault might just be my own, and Jenifer Prince for such dreamy cover art. It’s still going to make me happy every time I spot the paperback on my shelf.
