You could put trigger warnings on this for child abuse, incest, and cannibalism(!), and still the anguish of being forced to conform to society—”The Factory”—at the expense of all well-being forms the core of the horror. Particularly how women are reduced to wombs like factory components. Speculative fiction? Magical realism? Straight-up psychological horror? Yes. It’s harrowing and weird as fuck, and I liked it immensely, but maybe I’m Not Like Other Girls too.
