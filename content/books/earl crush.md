Listen, I’ve just about sworn off m/f romance after so many recent flops, but this one snuck in under the wire, as I was already committed to the ARC. It’s good! Not *amazing*, but good, in the fulfilled-the-brief, let’s-not-overthink-it kind of way I’ve been looking for [[digest/books of august ’24|since August]]. A few pacing niggles here or there, especially in the latter half, and I called both plot twists. The fact this did not deter me is basically a ringing endorsement at this point. I might even read more from Vasti when I’m in the mood again.

- The climax with pistols—done to much better effect here! Pretty much exactly [[notes/on firearms, trust and historical accuracy|what I was talking about in my recent rant]]. Lydia worries about her aim and any ricochets, and saves the day by smarter means.
- After reading *[[books/jane austen the secret radical|Jane Austen, The Secret Radical]]* and *[[books/i’m sorry for my loss|I’m Sorry for My Loss]]*, the epistolary epilogue full of multiple childbirths had me *stressed*. Vasti definitely puts the fantasy gloss on that one.
- The gold standard of and-then-there-were-children epilogues belongs to *[[books/a lady for a duke|A Lady for A Duke]]*, don’t @ me.
