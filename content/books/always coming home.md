I’ve been saving this one because [[notes/the carrier bag theory of fiction|the Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction]] has been such a foundational text for me, and this is where Ursula, more than ever, puts that theory to practice. 

As Shruti Swamy says in the introduction, what is on offer here is a profoundly different way of looking, seeing, even thinking.

> What I’m saying is that there is great fun to be had here, Ursula is having it, she is running wild as the oats through the Valley of her novel, hooting with delight. She’s willing to argue with the novel as much as we are, ready to poke holes in the perfection of this utopia—the idea of utopia at all—to allow in stinging insects and menstrual blood, men and boys who want to make war, girls who are restless with the sameness of Valley life, and grandmothers wrapped up in insane blood feuds. And don’t even get me started on the amazing audacity of creating a cassette tape of Kesh folk songs to go along with the first edition. I marvel, revel in this, the utter luxuriousness of watching a writer say yes to herself—the discipline she has to allow herself such freedom.

I plan to take my time, reading slowly all month (all year?). More to come.
