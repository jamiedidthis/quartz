> _For to think in deep time can be a means not of escaping our troubled present, but rather of re-imagining it; countermanding its quick greeds and furies with older, slower stories of making and unmaking._  
  
Three different siren calls for me: geology, linguistics, and deep time. Make that four: storytelling. Brilliant, beautiful, haunting, and thought-provoking book.
