Once again Alexis Hall takes away the book I thought I wanted and replaces it with the book I actually need.

Reading this at the same time as _[[books/the body keeps the score|The Body Keeps the Score]]_, though, just means I’m peeking between the lines of all the parental neglect and trauma and thinking, dearest Paris, get thee to some somatic therapy, medication is just a start. ♥️
