So good to read this while steeped in Florentine history. These are real people and real places, not just an abstract Lewis-esque allegory. Now I wish I knew Italian to read his _terza rima_ original, especially since I’ve had to dig through the Longfellow to see what’s underneath. (I’m comparing translations, which translates to realizing all translations suffer.)
