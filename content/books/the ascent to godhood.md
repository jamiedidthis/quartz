There are [[notes/mosaic novel|mosaic novels]]—these are mosaic novellas. I can see being disappointed with one if you picked it up standalone, but as a collective, each book a different facet of the whole, it’s some brilliant, satisfying storytelling.  
  
The villain of the first three books? Yeah, this is her story, told by her lover. What a way to end the series.
