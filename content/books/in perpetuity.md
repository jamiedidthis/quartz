Melancholy little novella about vampires stuck out of time in our modern world, besieged by the violent noises and smells as civilization encroaches upon them. The author has written other autistic characters; it seems like he has first hand experience of the nerve-wracking world of sensory overload to render it so accurately. Moreover, the language is a feastâ€”mannered, formal, elegant dialogue about Airplane Mode and bicycle helmets, all dislocated in time. *It seems as if everything has been everything, at least once, and all these fast-moving, fast-dying people forget it.*
