[As KJC says](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2602050279): In which we stick it to a duke. 

What *[[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]]* was to 2018, _Any Old Diamonds_ is to 2019. It’s SO good. An instant favorite. I might have to re-read both to decide which one I like best, and if it’s too close to call, which only means I should read them a third and fourth time, I won’t mind a bit.

(It could be recency bias, but I do think _Diamonds_ wins it. I mean, jewel thieves in love. Come on.)
