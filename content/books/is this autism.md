Once again I have read my way up from beginner to clinical level on a subject in the space of a year. I’m going to make a declarative statement that this is currently the best resource out there, full stop, on ASD and the myriad of ways it presents. The research is still in its infancy, but we’re starting to make strides in understanding it, especially how differently it can present in the non-male, non-white population. Therapists, psychiatrists, and clinicians, take note. (Pairs well with [[books/the autistic survival guide to therapy|Steph Jones]], which illustrates why this knowledge is desperately needed.)

Note: I also read [the blue book, the companion guide to diagnosing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175355864-is-this-autism-a-companion-guide-for-diagnosing?ref=nav_sb_ss_2_14).
