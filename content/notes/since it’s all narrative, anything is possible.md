> Because here’s the thing: since it’s all narrative, anything is possible. Those who see this have the ability to plunge toward health and human thriving without any regard for the made-up reasons why such a thing is impossible, and plant seeds of light which sprout in unprecedented directions that never could have been predicted by someone plugged into to establishment how-it-is stories. Together, we can determine how society will be. We can re-write the rules. We are re-writing the rules. It’s begun already. —[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], [Society Is Made Of Narrative. Realizing This Is Awakening From The Matrix.](https://www.caitlinjohnst.one/p/society-is-made-of-narrative-realizing)
