title: "Anthropocene"
---

Climate change scientists proposed use of this term at the start of the millennium and adopted it in 2016. There has been pushback, however, with anthropologists and philosophers claiming it limits the conversation and misplaces the blame, failing to account for the political and economic systems that drive our destructive practices.

> One problem with the apocalyptic “Anthropocene” is that it tends to inspire a disturbing level of “cynicism,” “defeatism,” or indeed “passive nihilism” by granting the disaster the seemingly inexorable status of a geological epoch: there is, it might seem, nothing to be done—no way to live otherwise.
> 
> Moreover, the Anthropocene falsely universalizes these destructive agents as “the anthropos,” when the blame lies not with “humanity” as such but with its particularly ecocidal, white Euro-American, industrial-capitalist subspecies.
> 
> In fact, this very terminology might be preventing us from imagining worlds otherwise.[^3]

The problem isn’t humanity as such, but the wealthy inhabitants of overdeveloped nations who have built their industrial worlds upon the desceration of others’ worlds. Hence there is increasing support for labeling it the “Capitalocene” over “Anthropocene.”[^1] “The anthropos, if there is such a thing, isn’t the problem.“[^2]

> We should beware, Donna Haraway cautions, of capitulating to the alluring “cosmofaith in technofixes.” After all, such technologies—which reliably promise to deliver profit as well as a habitably hacked planet—are the product of the colonially and genocidally fueled white-industrial capitalism that created the disaster they now endeavor to fix.[^4]

Indigenous, eastern, and non-dominant Western perspectives on the concept of “world” (i.e. [[animism]], [[pantheism]]) can help unsettle the increasingly omnipresent language of “the Anthropocene” and let us imagine [[notes/science fiction futures]].

In [[Staying with the Trouble]], [[Donna Haraway]] proposes the “Chthulucene” is a more expansive elswhere to the Anthropocene and Capitalocene, acknowleging the [[notes/a messy plurality|messy plurality]] of it all, where humans and non-humans can thrive together in kinship and a healthy, sustainable ecosystem.

> The unifinished Chthulucene must collect up the trash of the Anthropocene, the exterminism of the Capitalocene, and chipping and shredding like a mad gardener, make a much hotter [[compost]] pile for still possible pasts, presents, and futures.
