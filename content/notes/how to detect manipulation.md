If you feel muddled, scrambled, disoriented, that’s a sign of psychological manipulation/distortion, or often downright abuse. If you feel clarity, even if it’s challenging and uncomfortable, you’re likely on to something true. 

Note: to me this is different than feeling uncertain. Uncertainty is an honest and even necessary state, open to inquiry and reflection. Disoriented/scrambled is more of a dishonest state, where you don’t even have enough clarity to know which way is up, much less start seeking the truth. 

But being stuck is the first step. *Awareness* of being stuck is the first huge step. [[notes/noticing the block means you’re ready to do the work|Noticing the block means you’re ready to do the work]].
