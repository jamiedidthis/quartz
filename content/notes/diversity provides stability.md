In nature, diversity provides ecological stability. Monocropping/monoculture leads to a very precarious existence, prone to disease, collapse, and death. But the more diverse the ecosystem, the more robust and healthy it is.

> Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Fungi are also dependent on very stable conditions and support other species underground, protecting them from complete collapse and ensuring one species of tree doesn’t dominate. —[[authors/peter wohlleben|Peter Wohlleben]], *[[books/the hidden life of trees|The Hidden Life of Trees]]*
