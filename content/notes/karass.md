A group of people linked in a cosmically significant manner, even when superficial linkages are not evident.

Coined by [[authors/kurt vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut]] in 1963, as a Bokononist term in the novel *[[books/cats cradle|Cat’s Cradle]]*. Other karass-related terms:

- _duprass_ – a karass of only two people, who almost always die within a week of each other. The typical example is a loving couple who work together for a great purpose.
- _granfalloon_ – a false _karass_; i.e., a group of people who imagine they have a connection that does not really exist. An example is “Hoosiers.” Hoosiers are people from Indiana, and Hoosiers have no true spiritual destiny in common. They really share little more than a name.
- _wampeter_ – the central theme or purpose of a _karass_. Each karass has two wampeters at any given time, one waxing and one waning.
- _foma_ – harmless untruths
- _kan-kan_ – An object or item that brings a person into their karass. The narrator states in the book that his _kan-kan_ was the book he wrote about the Hiroshima bombing.
- _sinookas_ – The [[notes/rhizomatic thinking is non-hierarchal and relational|intertwining “tendrils”]] of peoples’ lives.
