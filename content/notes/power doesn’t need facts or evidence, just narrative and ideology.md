> Power doesn’t need facts or evidence, even when its claims are self-evidently disruptive to the democratic process. It exists chiefly in the realm of narrative and ideology. This is a story, just like Corbyn’s “antisemitism crisis”, that is made true simply through repetition.

> Because power is power, its narratives can defy the most elementary rules of logic. After all, how could an unverified, evidence-free *narrative* about Russian interference on behalf of Sanders’ campaign be more important than *actual interference* by anonymous “US officials” intended to damage Sanders’ campaign? How could such undemocratic, unaccountable efforts to interfere in the outcome of the US election be so readily peddled by the media unless the entire press corps is incapable or unwilling to engage their critical faculties in favour of the democratic principles they claim to uphold? Unless, in truth, they are not there representing us, the people, and our interests, but are instead simply servants of what amounts to a power-cult. —[[authors/jonathan cook|Jonathan Cook]], [How we stay blind to the story of power](https://www.jonathan-cook.net/blog/2020-02-24/story-of-power/)
