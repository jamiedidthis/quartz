Funny how “changing the system from within” produces the same results as not even trying to change it at all.

> I call Obama’s particular brand of establishment sycophancy Nice Guy Fascism. It’s just like regular fascism, enabling the brutal dominion of a few depraved and bloodthirsty tyrants, except you get to look like a nice guy while you’re participating in it. You claim you want to help people, but you put on the uniform of fascism and advance its pernicious ideology in order to do so. To “work within the system” you have to climb into the system, ingratiate yourself to the system, and keep the system sufficiently pleased with you so that it won’t reject you like a mismatched organ transplant. You’re covering yourself with feces and then running into the crowd trying to wipe the dirt off them with your hands. —[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], [Trying To Change The System From Within Is Like Trying To Dry Your Hair With Rain](https://caityjohnstone.medium.com/trying-to-change-the-system-from-within-is-like-trying-to-dry-your-hair-with-rain-71bac2211d6c)
