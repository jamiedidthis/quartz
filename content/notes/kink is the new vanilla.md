It’s funny, I’ve seen scattered comments lately, mostly on the r/romancelandia and r/ao3 subreddits, of people saying they prefer vanilla/chaste/closed door stories now because kink is basically the norm, so therefore predictable and boring.

1. Just like any sex scene, kink alone does not make it interesting or good—I’ve read absolutely dire representations of kink. (\*cough\* ahem the book *[[books/kink|Kink]]*)
2. Just like any sex, kink is highly personal, what floats one boat won’t float another.

But it does intrigue me that if any fringe idea becomes common and mainstream enough, then what was once common and mainstream becomes the new fringe (whether that’s just the perception or not).
