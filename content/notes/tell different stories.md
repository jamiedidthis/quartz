We often forget that our storytelling is rooted in millennia of oral tradition. Collaborative, mutable, fluid, living narratives that changed to suit different ecosystems and social scenarios. 

Written tales are more “permanent,” but they have a harder time evolving. So we’ve traded (a false sense of) permanence for the complex and evolving narrative lifeforms.

> Merlin’s story appears fixed. But then he shoots back with the transformative question: “Who told you this?” Who does this story belong to? Can we tell a different one? A written story becomes fixed, but a spoken question invites a response. The rhythm of call and response, collaborative creating, can show us that even when we feel stuck, there is always a trapdoor. A new story to tell.[^1]
