title: "Capitalism cannot solve the climate crisis"

Capitalism as an economic system cannot solve the climate crisis. Relying on production and consumption to “fix” the consequences of our production and consumption can only exacerbate the crisis. 

> We should beware, [[Donna Haraway]] cautions, of capitulating to the alluring “cosmofaith in technofixes.” After all, such technologies—which reliably promise to deliver profit as well as a habitably hacked planet—are the product of the colonially and genocidally fueled white-industrial capitalism that created the disaster they now endeavor to fix. As James Cone asks, “Do we really think that the culture most responsible for the ecological crisis will also provide the moral and intellectual resources for the earth’s liberation?”
