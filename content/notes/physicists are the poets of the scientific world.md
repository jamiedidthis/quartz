Physicists are the poets of the scientific world, more playful and less hidebound creatures than, say, biologists—once you can embrace alternate universes, dark matter, and quantum physics, it’s not much of a leap for other things.

> Curiously, it’s largely physicists who have proved receptive to such ideas. (Also mathematicians— perhaps unsurprisingly, since Peirce and Whitehead themselves both began their careers as mathematicians.) Physicists are more playful and less hidebound creatures than, say, biologists— partly, no doubt, because they rarely have to contend with religious fundamentalists challenging the laws of physics. They are the poets of the scientific world. If one is already willing to embrace thirteen-dimensional objects or an endless number of alternative universes, or to casually suggest that 95 percent of the universe is made up of dark matter and energy about whose properties we know nothing, it’s perhaps not too much of a leap to also contemplate the possibility that subatomic particles have “free will” or even experiences. And indeed, the existence of freedom on the subatomic level is currently a heated question of debate. —[[authors/david graeber|David Graeber]], [[notes/what's the point if we can't have fun|What’s the point if we can’t have fun?]]
