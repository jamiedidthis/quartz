[[authors/jo walton|Jo Walton]], in the foreward for *[[books/china mountain zhang|China Mountain Zhang]]*, discusses the difference between books of interconnected short stories vs. mosaic novels. 

> A normal novel tells a story by going straightforwardly at it, maybe with different points of view, maybe braided, but clearly going down one road of story. A mosaic novel builds up a picture of a world and a story obliquely, so that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.

[Per Joe McDermott](https://reactormag.com/five-mosaic-novels-you-should-read/), a mosaic novel fractures one or more story elements: plot, theme, characters, and/or setting, but then one of these elements binds the various story threads together and keeps the reader anchored in the tale as a whole.

That’s already mixing metaphors, which is why I like the term tapestry novel too, the [[notes/collective folk texts|weaving together]] of many different threads into a whole.

[[authors/kurt vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut]] claimed that his books “are essentially mosaics made up of a whole bunch of tiny little chips... and each chip is a joke.”[^1]
