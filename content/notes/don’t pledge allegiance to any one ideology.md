Make a patchwork quilt! That’s so much more fun, effective, and reliable than devoting yourself to any one ideology.

Ideology → purity → supremacy happens all the time. Or at best, you get tangled up in labels and abstractions, and the arguments thereof. 

The closest ideologies to my own values are an overlapping hodgepodge of taoism, anarchism, and indigenous animism, with a lil’ sprinkling of socialism, etc. (And indeed, [[notes/individuality is inseparable from community|they keep overlapping]].) But I am not an *-ist* of any one of those things.

I hold my core beliefs much more firmly, and therefore my ideologies much more loosely than that. Attaching to a label or doctrine is like putting a leash on your neck and asking to be led astray. And if we make a healthy world, it’s not going to come from one ideology neatly replacing another. 

[[notes/diversity provides stability|Diversity is stability]]; the healthiest world we can build will necessarily be a fecund and wildly diverse array of ideas. I might as well do what I can to start sewing the patchwork quilt now.
