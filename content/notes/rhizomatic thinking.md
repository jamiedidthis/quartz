Rhizome, from the ancient Greek: a mass of roots. In botany, it describes a plant system that extends roots and shoots from its nodes in every direction.

[The rhizome was adopted as a philosophical concept](https://literariness.org/2017/04/26/the-philosophical-concept-of-rhizome/) to describe a process of existence and growth with no clear heirarchy or single central point of origin. It doesn’t start from anywhere or end anywhere; it grows from everywhere, can reproduce from any node, and has no center, which makes it difficult to uproot or destroy. The internet is a rhizome. [[notes/language is a network|Language is a rhizome]]. 

In the modern western world, we have inherited an arborescent view of the world (tree-like, heirarchic). A seed or acorn takes root and grows into a tree; all subsequent Platonic philosophies are an outgrowth of Plato, etc.

It turns out, that model is incorrect even for trees—forests are superorganisms with interconnections much like ant colonies.{% include sidenote.html sidenote="[[Peter Wohlleben]], [[books/the hidden life of trees]], p. 3" sidenoteID="hidden-life-of-trees" %} Beneath the soil, mycelium is ecological connective tissue, the living seam by which much of the world is stitched into relation.{% include sidenote.html sidenote="[[Merlin Sheldrake]], [[books/entangled life]], p. 46" sidenoteID="entangled-life" %}

Indigenous and eastern philosophies have a much better grasp of this interrelationality. An arborescent worldview means we think in heirarchies, binaries, and dualist categories. In rhizomatic thinking, there’s no clear start or end, just the ever-proliferating jungle with a life of its own.
