Is ridding yourself of all “groupthink” another pursuit of purity? Does the quest for purity only happen within the groupthink/ideology? Are there elements of “groupthink” that are merely the human traits as a communal species? Like censorship, there has never been some ideal state without it, only existing to various healthy or toxic degrees??

Eschew the binaries and rigid frameworks even here?
