Hey! Here‚Äôs a thought! Do not yearn for the authoritarian school of social change! Do not force your ideas on anyone else! üíÄ

> I love people, but a lot of them‚Äîmaybe most?‚Äîyearn for their side to acquire absolute power. They seem to believe in the *authoritarian school of social change:* the only way to create a better world is for a strong central actor to force it on everybody else. They don‚Äôt think of this as *tyranny*, of course. They think of it as *doing the right thing.* And if a thing is right, well, duh, you should *make* people do it!

> The most hideous ideologies are often the ones we believe without even realizing it. They feel like breathing air and eating food, so natural and necessary that the alternative never occurs to us. I think the authoritarian school of social change is one of those. (Hence why its acronym is ASS-C.) ‚Äî[[authors/adam mastroianni|Adam Mastroianni]], [Good Ideas Don‚Äôt Need Bayonets](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/good-ideas-dont-need-bayonets)
