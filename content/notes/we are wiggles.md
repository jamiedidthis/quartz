The physical world is wiggly as all get-out! We are the ones who try to box things in with our concrete categories and straight lines.

> See, the physical world is *wiggly*. Clouds, mountains, trees, people—everything is wiggly. It’s only when human beings get working on things that they build buildings in straight lines and try to make the world unwiggly. But here we are—sitting in rooms with all these straight lines—but each one of us is wiggly as all get-out. —[[authors/alan watts|Alan Watts]], *[[books/out of your mind|Out of Your Mind]]*
