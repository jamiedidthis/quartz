Deep time, coined by John McPhee in [[books/basin and range|Basin and Range]], is a concept of geological time so vast it completely annihilates the scale of human history.

> Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time. Any number above a couple of thousand years—fifty thousand, fifty million—will with nearly equal effect awe the imagination to the point of paralysis.

> McPhee, *[[books/basin and range|Basin and Range]]*, p. 29


It decenters the human, and forces us to ask [[notes/good ancestors|are we being good ancestors?]]

> Seen in deep time—viewed even in the relatively shallow time since the last glaciation—the notion of human dominance over the planet seems greedy, delusory.
