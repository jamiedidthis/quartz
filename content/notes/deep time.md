Deep time, coined by [[authors/john mcphee|John McPhee]] in *[[books/annals of the former world|Basin and Range]]*, is a concept of geological time so vast it completely annihilates the scale of human history.

> Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time. Any number above a couple of thousand years—fifty thousand, fifty million—will with nearly equal effect awe the imagination to the point of paralysis.[^1]

It decenters the human, and forces us to ask [[notes/good ancestors|are we being good ancestors?]]

> Seen in deep time—viewed even in the relatively shallow time since the last glaciation—the notion of human dominance over the planet seems greedy, delusory.[^2]
