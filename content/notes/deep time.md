Deep time, coined by [[John McPhee]] in [[books/basin and range]], is a concept of geological time so vast it completely annihilates the scale of human history.

> Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time. Any number above a couple of thousand years—fifty thousand, fifty million—will with nearly equal effect awe the imagination to the point of paralysis.
