On the whole radical acceptance front, even confusion—*especially* confusion—can be enormously helpful in our lives. It points to where the soil needs to be tilled, old ways dug up and new ways cultivated and planted.

> The idea that confusion could have therapeutic value is powerful because it takes a human condition that’s generally thought to be negative and suggests that it could actually be a kind of crucible. It probes into the possibility that confusion could actually be an ideal time for working on our ancient and atrophied modes of seeing, moving, and knowing. —[[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]], *[[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]]*
