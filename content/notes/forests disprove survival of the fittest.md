In a forest, well-being depends on community and diversity. It’s not a race to the top for dominance, but a web of interdependencies, that depends on even the supposedly “weakest” trees for survival.

> It’s not survival of the fittest—their well-being depends on community. When supposedly feeble trees disappear, the others lose as well. The forest is no longer a single closed unit. Sun and winds can now penetrate to the forest floor and disrupt the climate. Even strong trees get sick a lot and depend on their weaker neighbors to survive. If they are no longer there, all it takes is a harmless insect attack to seal the fate even of giants. —[[authors/peter wohlleben|Peter Wohlleben]], *[[books/the hidden life of trees|The Hidden Life of Trees]]*
