In [Who Gets to Medicate Me?](https://sluggish.substack.com/p/who-gets-to-medicate-me), Jesse Meadows (@sluggish) interrogates the cultural, puritanical idea that pleasure is destructive.

> Psychoactive drugs have direct effects on us, and sometimes those effects feel good, which can be helpful in itself. Puritanical thought and anti-drug propaganda have led us to think of pleasure as destructive, but pleasure can be therapeutic, too. That should be reason enough to have safe access to a substance, but due to the past century of power struggles and profit motives, we’re no longer allowed to see it that way. 
> 
> “Recovering” from a “legitimate illness” is not supposed to have anything to do with pleasure. It’s just about tuning the body like a machine, getting back to that mythical state of normal, productive, efficient worker — a standard both people with ADHD and people who use drugs fall short of. We are not so different, and we could demand so much more together.

A big reason why I have *[[books/pleasure activism|Pleasure Activism]]* waiting to be read.
