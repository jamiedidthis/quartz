Vicarious joy, experiencing pleasure because of another personâ€™s pleasure. Basically the opposite of jealousy. 

Coined by the [Kerista Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerista "w:Kerista") in the 1970s, probably following the model of _dispersion_, so that use specifically applies to polyamorous relationships, the pleasure of your partner experiencing pleasure with someone else.[^1]

Not unlike the Buddhist concept of sympathetic joy (_mudita_ in Sanskrit). Or Neitzsche coining [[mitfreude]].
