Basically vicarious joy, the opposite of jealousy. Specifically applies to relationships re: polyamory, the pleasure of your partner finding pleasure with another person.

Coined by the [Kerista Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerista "w:Kerista") in the 1970s, probably following the model of _dispersion_.[^1]

Not unlike the Buddhist concept of sympathetic joy (_mudita_ in Sanskrit). Or Neitzsche coining [[mitfreude]].
