I was trying to find out if [[ada palmer|Ada Palmer]] coined vocateur in the [[Terra Ignota]] series, and just a cursory google search all give her credit for the term. Only early citation I could find is [a JSTOR article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26281186) from 1983 which, from the preview, seems to be discussing Arno Schmidt’s *Leviathan*. So maybe an obscure term (possibly in translation?) that Ada popularized, at least? 

Anyway. Vocateur (“voker” for short) is basically someone intensely devoted to their vocation. In the post-scarcity world of Terra Ignota, careers are a thing of the past, no one needs to earn their basic necessities, and one is not permitted to work more than a certain number of hours per week (10 I think?). Vocateurs apply for the permission to work extended hours on their passions. 

From [an interview with Ada](https://mrissa.livejournal.com/966088.html?): 

> I’ve been delighted to have a lot of readers respond enthusiastically to voker/vocateur, and I do think it’s something we see every day but don’t have a good name for, the difference between someone who works and then stops versus someone for whom work is an all-hours passion.  We have “day job” but that implies that it’s somehow not important, not the real you, whereas I have friends who love their jobs and are great at them but are still happy that the job ends when they clock out.  I like how voker/vocateur make clear that both kinds of relationship to one’s work are good and worthy of respect.

Appealing to that passion/love/respect makes the word useful to discuss the opposite too:

> I think the word “vocateur” is an important one to have as a tool for discussing job exploitation, how so many jobs that people are willing to do for love become riddled with exploitative practices (teaching, research, writing, animation, social work...)[^1]
