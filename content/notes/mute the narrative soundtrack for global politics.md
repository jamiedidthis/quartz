Much like mindfulness helps cut through the internal noise, muting the narrative helps cut through the external noise.

> Learn the art of perceiving life without the perceptual filter of narrative. Mentally “mute” the narrative soundtrack and watch where all the resources are going, where the weapons are moving to and coming from, who’s being killed and imprisoned etc, to get a clear picture of what’s going on in the world.
> 
> Almost everything in the news is empty/irrelevant narrative. The only relevant information is where the money is moving, where the resources are moving, where the weapons are moving, and where the people are moving. Everything else is narrative meant to justify, manipulate or distract from those movements. —[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], *[[books/notes from the edge of the narrative matrix|Notes from the Edge of the Narrative Matrix]]*

To help mute that soundtrack, here’s a hot tip: 

> There’s basically only ever one international news story: “Globe-spanning US-centralized empire tries to grow larger by absorbing more countries, and those countries resist.” All news about global politics is just different manifestations of that one story, seen from different angles. ([[books/notes from the edge of the narrative matrix|ibid.]])
