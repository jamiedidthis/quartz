Red flag for anything rationalizing “this is just the way things are,” or framing a problem as an individual one instead of a collective one. (Or worse, putting the onus on the victim instead of the offender.)

> Feminists know about power. Specifically, they know a lot about unequal power relationships; how they are systematically used, and how they are rationalised or explained away as ‘just the way things are’. Long before individual men abuse women, they internalise the logic of “[unequal power relationships between men, women and children embedded in social organisations like the family](https://www.secasa.com.au/pages/theories-on-why-sexual-abuse-happens/the-feminist-approach/)”. Abuse isn’t just pathological. It’s political. Where others might just see some behavioral problems that need fixing, one to one, a feminist sees the abuse of women and girls as something inevitable — even intentional — in patriarchy. So, just as we don’t fix climate change by individually eschewing plastic straws, we don’t fix our smartphones’ designed-in lack of trust by individually trying to spend a bit less time on Twitter. —Maria Farrell, [This is your phone on feminism](https://conversationalist.org/2019/09/13/feminism-explains-our-toxic-relationships-with-our-smartphones/)
