Copying this straight from *[[books/propaganda blitz|Propaganda Blitz]]* ([[authors/david edwards|David Edwards]] and [[authors/david cromwell|David Cromwell]]) because it‚Äôs immensely helpful to reference.

Propaganda blitzes are fast-moving attacks intended to inflict maximum damage in minimum time. They are:

1. based on allegations of dramatic new evidence
2. communicated with high emotional intensity and moral outrage
3. apparently supported by an informed corporate media/academic/expert consensus
4. reinforced by damning condemnation of anyone daring even to question the apparent consensus
5. often generated with fortuitous timing
6. characterised by tragicomic moral dissonance

Every one of these things, much less the concatenation of all of them, signals *red flag, red flag, red flag.* Do not fall for it! See below to expand on each item.

## ‚ÄãDramatic new evidence
- the basic theme: *this changes everything!*
- durability of the claims is not a chief concern; attention will rapidly move on (often distracted by another blitz)
- the hype may eventually be exposed as a fraud but it‚Äôs too little too late, and attention is intentionally diverted from it
- Examples: Gulf of Tonkin, the Iraq WMDs, Kuwaiti war crimes, Gaddafi/Benghazi, Syria chemical weapons, Corbyn anti-semitism, Venezuela regime change, Srebrenica massacre, Libya, Iran, Ukraine, Russiagate, literally too many to list 

## Emotional tone and intensity
- the tone is always shrill, vehement, and hysterical
- using this kind of outrage, the message to the public is that *there is no doubt*
- the picture must be clear-cut, the public made to feel there is no reasonable basis for uncertainty‚Äîthe ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù are absolutely appalling and must be removed
- relentless repetition for days, weeks, months, even years
- the implicit or increasingly explicit claim that if *you* are not equally outraged then *you* are despicable yourself

## Appearance of informed ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù
- certainty and outrage across the entire media ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù
- generates the impression that *everyone knows* the claim is truthful
- this is why the myth of a ‚Äúmedia spectrum‚Äù is so useful‚Äîthe snowballing consensus forces any dissidents to toe the line
- the consensus is ‚Äúall right-thinking people‚Äù‚Äîif you don‚Äôt join them you are despicable and wrong

## Demonising dissent
- to challenge the narrative is to risk becoming a target
- dissidents smeared as ‚Äúuseful idiots,‚Äù ‚Äúapologists,‚Äù ‚Äúgenocide deniers,‚Äù etc., or even ‚Äúsexist,‚Äù ‚Äúmisogynist,‚Äù ‚Äúracist,‚Äù ‚Äúanti-semitic,‚Äù etc.
- fake moral outrage
- extreme black/white thinking: if you question or speak out, then you support tyranny, dictatorship, fascism, etc.
- lasting damage to the dissidents‚Äô career and prospects
- thus, anyone in the media quickly learns to keep their head down and toe the line, lest they find themselves in the crosshairs
- the chilling message: *best to just keep quiet*
- examples: Julian Assange, Jeremy Corbyn, Edward Snowden, on and on

## Timing and fortuitous coincidences
- conveniently hits at the worst possible time for the establishment target, and/or with impeccable timing just ahead of key votes at the UN, Parliament, elections, etc.
- the ‚Äúofficial enemy‚Äù does *the one thing* most likely to trigger invasion, bombing, electoral disaster, and so on, at *exactly* the wrong time (i.e. Assad used chemical weapons exactly when chemical weapons inspectors entered the Syrian capital, etc.)
- calls on the Hollywood trope of idiotic blindly self-destructive Dr Evil villains, so you can think ‚Äúhe‚Äôs nuts, he‚Äôs really asking for it!‚Äù
- Milosevic, bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Ch√°vez, Gaddafi, Assad, Corbyn ‚Äì basically the same Bond villain over and over again
- examples: the almost daily terror warnings in US and UK ahead of the Iraq war, a ‚Äúsoftening up process‚Äù that was really a form of psychological terrorism Bush and Blair perpetuated on their own people; atrocity claims peaking in 2013 until Obama chose not to bomb Syria, at which point the daily headlines simply dried up

## Tragicomic moral dissonance
- targets are Official Enemies whose actual, alleged, and often invented crimes are dwarfed by the crimes committed by the western governments and their allies
- dissidents afforded vitriolic treatment that is never experienced by western presidents and prime ministers who devastate *whole countries* 
- judging the mere *words* of outsiders as worse than the *actions* of insiders that result in mass death
- example: raging at Gaddafi for allegedly *threatening* a massacre, but not a peep for US and UK leaders who killed over a million Iraqis, including 500,000 children
- propaganda blitzes never make moral sense
- ethical posturing generated by a structurally violent, greed-driven system for immoral ends
- pacifies the public so the powerful can do as they please

> There‚Äôs little or no relation between what the mass media direct people to care about and what actually matters. If you get all worked up about the Hot Topic of the Day like everyone else you‚Äôre usually just clapping along with a plutocratic puppet show made for stunted children. ‚Äî[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], *[[books/notes from the edge of the narrative matrix|Notes from the Edge of the Narrative Matrix]]*
