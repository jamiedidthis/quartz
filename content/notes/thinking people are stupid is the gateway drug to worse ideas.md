I’m highly allergic to the idea that other people are fundamentally stupid. It’s one small, flimsy step away from dehumanizing people completely, and once anyone is dehumanized, that leads to *a lot* of worse ideas.

When people like the things you hate, when they vote for the wrong guy, when they devote their lives to things you think are pointless, the easiest way to deal with them is to assume that God didn’t put enough neurons in their heads. If only their brain functioned properly, like yours does! Then they’d see.

When you write someone off as a moron, you suspend diplomatic relations; you declare war. This works the other way around, too—how can you have anything other than open hostilities with someone who has decided that your brain doesn’t work? —[[authors/adam mastroianni|Adam Mastroianni]], [The Radical Idea That People Aren’t Stupid](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-radical-idea-that-people-arent)
