You *knooooow* I will get on this soapbox all day long. [[notes/fanfiction is literature|All fiction is fanfiction]]. All art is fan art. 

Long before we had the (very super recent modern) idea that a book = a discrete, permanent object, we had [[collective folk texts]] that spread precisely because people remixed and remade them.

There could be no such thing as faithful reproduction. [[notes/all transmission is recreation|All transmission is recreation]]. The Iliad began as oral literature; Virgil borrowed a minor character and made him a hero of Rome in the Aeneid; Dante borrows Virgil and makes him his guide to purgatory in the Divine Comedy. Writing that builds on the universe of other writing is among our oldest forms of storytelling.[^1]

I like this definition of fanfic: [[notes/the culturally bound notion of authorship|the communal rewriting]] of a source text in conversation with each other.
