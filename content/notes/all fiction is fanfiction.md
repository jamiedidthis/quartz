You *knooooow* I will get on this soapbox all day long. All fiction is fanfiction. All art is fan art. 

Long before we had the (very super recent modern) idea that a book = a discrete, permanent object, we had collective folk texts that spread precisely because people remixed and remade them.

> There could be no such thing as faithful reproduction. [[notes/all transmission is recreation|All transmission is recreation]]. The Iliad began as oral literature; Virgil borrowed a minor character and made him a hero of Rome in the Aeneid; Dante borrows Virgil and makes him his guide to purgatory in the Divine Comedy. Writing that builds on the universe of other writing is among our oldest forms of storytelling. —[[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*
