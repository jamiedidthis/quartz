> I am talking here about the many prophets of doom who tell us that racism will never end, sexism is here to stay, the rich will never share their resources.

But in keeping with a capitalist-based notion of well-being, they really believe there is not enough to go around, that the good life can be had only by a few.

This concept of well-being only supports the [[notes/theology of capitalism|theology of capitalism]], aka the [[notes/myth of scarcity|myth of scarcity]] and [[notes/who is more deserving|who is more deserving]].
