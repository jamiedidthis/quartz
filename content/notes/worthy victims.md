Is one reason that we commemorate the Holocaust to the extent that we do because they were compliant victims? There was resistance in the form of escape, but not armed conflict. No brutal violence in return. Is it that same concept as [[notes/english poor laws|the worthy poor]], determining who deserves our sympathy and who doesnâ€™t? If there had been violent retaliation from the oppressed, would the history books tell a different story? Like Haiti, like Palestine, et. al.?
