[[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*: 

> A storyteller is a spinner of yarns, and the internetâ€™s founding metaphor is of [[notes/the internet is a rhizome|a web]]. If we go far enough back, before printing presses and cameras and photocopiers introduced the notion of faithful reproduction, all transmission is re-creation.

That hyphen can give it double meaning too. Re-creation. Recreation. [[notes/play gives meaning to life|Play]]. Fun.
