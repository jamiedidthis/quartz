Heyo, just like copyright, the notion of faithful reproduction is a very modern notion. And I’m gonna add Western industrialized notion—surely many if not all indigenous cultures still see the transmission of stories as re-creation.

> A storyteller is a spinner of yarns, and the internet’s founding metaphor is of a web. If we go far enough back, before printing presses and cameras and photocopiers introduced the notion of faithful reproduction, all transmission is re-creation. —[[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*

That hyphen can give it double meaning too. Re-creation. Recreation. Play. Fun.

- previously: [[notes/all fiction is fanfiction|all fiction is fanfiction]] — recreating (recreation) is basically the point
- on copyright: [[notes/we’ve had the right to adapt longer than we’ve had the right to prevent copying|we’ve had the right to adapt longer than we’ve had the right to prevent copying]]
- see also: [[notes/the internet is a rhizome|the internet is a rhizome]] — the founding metaphor may be a web, but now the internet has no beginning or no end
- see also: [[notes/play gives meaning to life|play gives meaning to life]] — do not forget to have fun
- tangent: on the subject of indigenous storytelling, when [[notes/animism is a dynamic, relational structure|animism is a dynamic, relational structure]], surely that gives rise to the notion that [[notes/healthy stories are fluid not fixed|healthy stories are fluid not fixed]]
