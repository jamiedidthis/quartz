Lynn Margulis coined the word “holobionts”—multispecies assemblages that are both more and less than one. All organisms are effectively “chimeric.”

Per Sophie Strand in [[books/the flowering wand|The Flowering Wand]]: 

> A holobiont is an assemblage of beings that create a larger whole. The word was first used in 1991 by Lynn Margulis in an attempt to explain her studies of hosts and inherited symbionts. … The closer we look at our bodies, the flimsier the idea of an individual, bounded self becomes. We are walking communities, swarms in suits and ties, skin-silhouetted Towers of Babel.

## Holobionts as God?

> This means that there are not just two, but an infinite number of holographic channels by means of which minds of all sorts could in principle conceive of God. Our monster is therefore not just a conflation of binaries, but rather an omni-faceted beast appearing under totally different aspects, depending on your point of view.[^1]

Lovelock’s and Lynn Margulis’s central insight was that living things change the “environment” to such an extent that it is incoherent to speak of an environment at all; Gaia is the open, interlocking biotic systems that determine her condition. Stengers admits that “Lovelock perhaps went a bit too far in affirming that this processual coupling ensured a stability.”

## We are collaborative compound organisms

> Yes, we are beginning to encounter ourselves—not always comfortably or pleasantly—as multi-species beings already partaking in timescales that are fabulously more complex than the onwards. driving version of history many of us still imagine ourselves to inhabit. The work of the radical biologist Lynn Margulis and others has shown humans to be not solitary beings, but what Margulis memorably calls “holobionts”—collaborative compound organisms, ecological units ‘consisting of trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi that coordinate the task of living together and sharing a common life’, in the philosopher Glenn Albrecht’s phrase.[^2]

 This thinking is not new, though, when viewed from the perspective of [[notes/animism|animist traditions]] of indigenous peoples.
