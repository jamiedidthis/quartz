It doesn’t take much to persuade us that censorship is good, when it aligns with what we fear or who we want to protect from harm. 

> We tend instinctively to call things censorship primarily when we perceive those involved to have bad intentions. But we tend to excuse or discount censorious actions when we perceive the motives to be good. To understand how real censorship works, we need to thank Orwell for the tools that he’s given us, but push back as well and reintroduce the fact that ==most censorship is not motivated by a sinister will to power, but by other motives including the desire to protect, a sense of crisis, fear, patriotism, even love.== —[[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]], [Tracing Censorship of Radical Ideas Across Centuries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HyXTIWcP4A)

> Real censorship tends to be motivated by the desire to protect, ==seeing itself as preventing harm, not an iron boot, but a gentle hug,== while other motives such as profit or power seeking tend to hide behind the excuse of protecting others, and those with other motives get to deny that they are doing “bad censorship.” —[[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]], [2023 Nuveen Lecture, “Why We Censor: from the Inquisition to the Internet”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&v=uMMJb3AxA0s)
