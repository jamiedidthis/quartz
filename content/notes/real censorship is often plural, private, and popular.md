When we only have one template for what censorship looks like—state-driven, authoritarian, Orwellian—we fail to see the myriad kinds of censorship that don’t resemble it. 

> Alarm bells go off the instant people see censorship which resembles Orwell, which creates a corresponding weakness or failure to observe when censorship begins that does not resemble Orwell. 

> Censorship is often plural, often private, often popular. And we learn more from the motives of the private citizen who cheerfully attends a book burning than we can from Orwell’s imagined O’Brien. —[[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]], [Tracing Censorship of Radical Ideas Across Centuries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HyXTIWcP4A)
