title: Multiple intelligence theory

Howard Gardner first outlined his theory in his 1983 book *Frames of Mind*, where he suggested that all people have different kinds of intelligence.

He proposed that there are eight intelligences, and has suggested the possible addition of a ninth known as “existentialist intelligence.”

1. **Linguistic intelligence**—a deep-rooted understanding and nuanced use of language, a proficiency that goes beyond fluency. Can manifest in diverse ways, like a deep grasp of language mechanics or a unique approach to storytelling.
2. **Logical-mathematical intelligence**—goes beyond the capability to perform arithmetic calculations, and involves skilled reasoning, pattern recognition, and deductive thinking. Uses logic to solve problems and structures the chaos around us into comprehensible forms.
3. **Spatial intelligence**—a highly developed capacity to think, visualize, and operate in three dimensions. Not limited to just physical navigation, but vital in fields like architecture, design, and even theoretical physics.
4. **Musical intelligence**—the ability to understand music, but also how one connects with the essence of life through rhythms, tones, and patterns.
5. **Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence**—a masterful control of one’s movements, coordination, and physical expressions. Can manifest as athleticism, dance, acting, even craftsmanship. 
6. **Interpersonal intelligence**—a rich internal life, deeply rooted in self-awareness, emotional understanding, and introspection. Often ponders ethical and existential questions. (This is the part that can branch off into the hypothesized existentialist intelligence.)
7. **Naturalist intelligence**—the unique ability to identify, categorize, and understand patterns in the natural world. A heightened sensitivity that speaks to our most primal instincts, developed over millennia of human evolution. 

Found via [While You Wonder](https://www.whileyouwonder.com/post/do-all-autistic-people-have-intellectual-disability-deep-div), which specifically applies the theory to the [[autism|autistic neurotype]].

With these definitions, I score higher in some areas than I’d think, lol. Like math. If it’s more about logic and pattern recognition than multiplying numbers, then yes! So even these types are mutable into subtypes.

(I’d guess I score highest at language and logic, lowest at music and kinesthetic…)
