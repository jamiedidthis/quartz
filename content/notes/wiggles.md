[[authors/alan watts|Alan Watts]] in *[[books/out of your mind|Out of Your Mind]]*: 

> See, the physical world is *wiggly*. Clouds, mountains, trees, people—everything is wiggly. It’s only when human beings get working on things that they build buildings in straight lines and try to make the world unwiggly. But here we are—sitting in rooms with all these straight lines—but each one of us is wiggly as all get-out.

It’s notoriously difficult to get control over something that wiggles. A fish is extremely wiggly—it takes a net full of holes to control and measure. 

> Any good scientist knows that what you call the external world is as much you as your own body. Your skin doesn’t actually separate you from the world—it’s a bridge through which the world flows into you, and you flow into the world. You’re just like a whirlpool. The whirlpool has a definite form, but at no time does water stay put in it. The whirlpool is something the stream is doing, just as [[you are the process|we are things the whole universe is doing]]. So if I meet you again tomorrow, I’ll recognize you as the same whirlpool I saw yesterday, but you’re moving. The  whole world is moving through you—cosmic rays, oxygen, the stream of steaks and milk and eggs you eat— everything flows right through you. ==You’re a wiggle, and the world is wiggling you.==
