Conveniently, the strategies for dealing with sociopathic manipulators are the exact same, whether itâ€™s a partner, a parent, a pastor, or a plutocrat. ðŸ™ƒ

1. Get clear on your own will
2. Watch where all the resources are going
3. Watch actions, not their words
4. Donâ€™t try to out manipulate 
5. Apply the manipulatorâ€™s rules in reverse

> Hereâ€™s the key: simply reverse the pronouns. When faced with a manipulator, everything he says about you, he is saying about himself, and everything he says about himself, is what he thinks of you. If heâ€™s telling you *youâ€™re* duplicitous and *youâ€™re* a liar and *youâ€™re* trying to take him for all heâ€™s got, heâ€™s actually saying *heâ€™s* duplicitous and *heâ€™s* a liar and *heâ€™s* trying to take you for all youâ€™ve got. If you have good grounds to believe you are being manipulated by someone, reverse the pronouns in your mind and let them tell you who they are. It works from personal relationships right up to the grand manipulators employed by the plutocrats. â€”[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], [How To Beat A Manipulator](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2018/08/17/how-to-beat-a-manipulator/)
