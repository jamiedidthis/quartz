> If humanity is to survive into the future and move out of its psychopathy-enabling competition-based models into a collaborative relationship with all of humankind and with its entire ecosystem, that future will necessarily come with an abandonment of our ancient impulse to control. Our impulse to control nations, to control each other, to control life itself. It will come with an abandonment of empire, an abandonment of power agendas, and an abandonment of the human ego. —[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], [On Psychopathy, Power, Empire And Ego](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2022/05/06/on-psychopathy-power-empire-and-ego/)

If that seems impossible, then remember: 

> The more control you exert over your environment, the more your environment is destroyed. The more control you exert over your citizenry, the more likely they are to put someone else in charge at the earliest opportunity. The more control you exert over your employees, the more likely they are to want to go work someplace else. The more control you exert over your friends and coworkers, the more likely they are to turn against you. The more control you exert over your family, the more likely they are to avoid you. The more control you exert over your lover, the more likely they are to stop loving you. The more control you exert over life, the more likely you are to suffer. —[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], [You are only as free as you allow your world to be](https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2022/06/07/youre-only-as-free-as-you-allow-your-world-to-be/)
