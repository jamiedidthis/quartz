The internet is not a textbook, or even a wiki, or any kind of single, linear, finite entity. The internet is a rhizome.

> When we thought of language as a book, we thought of it as linear and finite. A book can only have so many pages, so you have to decide what to keep in, what to fence out, and how to order what remains. If you and I buy the same dictionary, we read the same exact words, making it seem like there is a single, finite English language that everyone agrees upon, which can be contained between two covers. But the internet has no beginning or end, and it’s growing faster than any one person can follow. —[[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*
