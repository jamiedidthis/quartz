A proposition: what if amateur could outrank professional in terms of our respect? We tend to use *amateur* pejoratively, to indicate the lack of skill, but the word in French means *lover*. If you think about it this way:

Amateur: *one who loves*  
Professional: *one who is financially obligated*

Which one has the lack? I think it’s worth considering our knee-jerk moral judgements on the term. It’s perilously close to [[notes/all fiction is fanfiction|my fanfiction soapbox]], but I can think of so many instances where *love of, for intrinsic reward* is just as if not more commendable than *obligation to, for extrinsic reward*. 

Then we could introduce the term [[notes/vocateur|vocateur]], for those whose amateur pursuits become expertise.
