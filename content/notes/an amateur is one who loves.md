A proposition: what if amateur could outrank professional in terms of our respect? We tend to use *amateur* pejoratively, to indicate the lack of skill, but the word in French means *lover*. If you think about it this way:

Amateur: *one who loves*  
Professional: *one who is financially obligated*

Which one has the lack? I think it’s worth considering our knee-jerk moral judgements on the term. It’s perilously close to [[notes/all fiction is fanfiction|my fanfiction soapbox]], but I can think of so many instances where *love of, for intrinsic reward* is just as if not more commendable than *obligation to, for extrinsic reward*. 

Then we could introduce the term [[notes/vocateur|vocateur]], for those whose amateur pursuits become expertise.

anecdote 1/11/25: I was thinking about this today during the British cyclocross national championships. Most of the nationals in various countries weren’t filmed or broadcast, and a young British fan took it upon herself to [livestream and commentate as a spectator.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ecCeI02yts) She did a bang up job, and the little community of fans (several hundred!) watching and commenting on the stream, as well as the r/cyclocross subreddit, was full of joy, praise, and gratitude. It wasn’t that thing of just humoring a kid’s well-meaning attempt, either. It was total respect for her skills, amazement and admiration that she was doing this “job” as well as a pro would.

It was such a cool thing to witness. The fandom and love of the sport linking it all together was such a different feel from the paid professional broadcasters, as great as they are. The communal participation instead of one-way consuming. There’s no way to replicate that without an amateur creating something just for the love of it.
