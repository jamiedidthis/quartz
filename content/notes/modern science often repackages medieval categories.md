There is a longstanding tradition of borrowing older scientific or medical categories, merely updating the terminology but keeping the same (invalid) assertions.

> When the nineteenth-century medicolegal term “homosexuality” was brought into official Catholic speech, it replaced the eleventh-century theological term “sodomy.” “Homosexuality” took the place of “sodomy” in the way a substitute teacher takes over a class. It arrived, rushing and confused, to face an already fixed lesson plan. —[[authors/mark d jordan|Mark D. Jordan]], *[[books/the silence of sodom|The Silence of Sodom]]*

Other examples, a far from incomplete list:
- “Degeneracy” theory → “racial theory” ([[authors/francis mark mondimore|Francis Mark Mondimore]], *[[books/a natural history of homosexuality|A Natural History of Homosexuality]]*)
- Hysteria → PMS ([[notes/pms and other pathologies are culture-bound syndromes|PMS and other pathologies are culture-bound syndromes]])
- Hysteria → nymphomania (“Nymphomania was just a fancy new way of saying “madness from the womb,” really, with just as much going for it as a scientific concept.” —[[authors/jesse bering|Jesse Bering]], *[[books/perv|Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us]]*)
