> Spencer Brownâ€™s point is that a system which observes itself can never observe all of itself, and that, therefore, as our telescopes become more powerful the universe must necessarily expand. If I am continuous with the universe, if the physics of my body is the same as the physics of everything else, then I have the same relation to the outside world as to that much of my own body which I can see. Without mirrors I cannot see my back or my head. Even with mirrors I cannot see into my brain, and even if, like a neurosurgeon, I study other peopleâ€™s brains, I cannot study my own while I am doing it. This is utterly frustrating, but it has a marvelous and fascinating implication which is absolutely inescapable. ==You yourself are the universe which you are observing. You are trying to get at yourself when you love/hate other people.== I am going to leave it to you to work out the connection between the frustration and its implication (itâ€™s a wonderful trip), and only add that the aspect of yourself which you cannot see is obviously not any idea, image, or opinion of yourself that you have already formed. â€”[[authors/alan watts|Alan Watts]], *[[books/cloud-hidden whereabouts unknown|Cloud-Hidden Whereabouts Unknown]]*
