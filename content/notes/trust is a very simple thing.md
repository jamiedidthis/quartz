I often hear the line now, “when someone shows you who they are, believe them.” It’s come up in therapy, it’s shared around in different online groups I’m in. I hope that means it’s becoming common knowledge, because it really is that simple: trust is simple and often very obvious.[^1]

> Trust is a very simple thing: you can trust people to act out the behavior patterns they normally act out. Behavior patterns are generally pretty trustworthy. You can trust nurturing people to do nurturing things,[^2] and you can trust destructive people to do destructive things. ==As long as you’re trusting someone to do what they normally do instead of what they don’t normally do, your trust will probably be well-placed.== —[[authors/caitlin johnstone|Caitlin Johnstone]], [Stop Trivializing the Term ‘Coup’](https://caityjohnstone.medium.com/stop-trivializing-the-term-coup-notes-from-the-edge-of-the-narrative-matrix-fdc49a95fdd2)

[^1]: Although we’ve had the “actions speak louder than words” adage around for aeons and plenty of people still fall for the words.
[^2]: This makes me think of Katerina Kepler’s line from *[[books/everyone knows your mother is a witch|Everyone Knows Your Mother is a Witch]]*, by [[authors/rivka galchen|Rivka Galchen]]: “Anyone who takes gentle care of a cow is someone I trust. It’s a more telling characteristic of a person than taking Communion.”
