In Hinduism, the concept of lila is that all of life—indeed, the cosmos—is an expression of divine, cosmic playfulness.

> Lila (or leela) can be loosely translated as “divine play”. The concept of lila asserts that creation, instead of being an objective for achieving any purpose, is rather an outcome of the playful nature of the divine. As the divine is perfect, it could have no want fulfilled, thereby signifying freedom, instead of necessity, behind the creation.[^1]

This dovetails nicely with [[authors/david graeber|Graeber’s]] [[notes/play could be the basis of physical reality|theory of play as the basis of physical reality]], [[authors/pyotr kropotkin|Kropotkin’s]] suggestion that [[notes/cooperation is a form of pleasure and play|social cooperation is a form of playfulness]], a few central tenets of [[notes/taoism|taoism]], and so forth.
