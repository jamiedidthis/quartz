[[authors/alan watts|Alan Watts]], in [[books/out of your mind|Out of Your Mind]]: 

> If there was a big bang at the beginning of time, you are not something that is the *result* of that explosion at the end of the process. You *are* the process.
> 
> You are the big bang. You are the original force of the universe manifesting as whoever you are in the moment. You define yourself as Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. So-and-So, but you’re actually the primordial energy of the universe that’s still in process. It’s just that you learned to define  yourself as something separate.

I like this idea too: [[we are symptomatic of the universe]].

> You and I are as continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean. The ocean *waves*, the universe *peoples*.
