How fluid is our sense of the erotic? Like neurological plasticity, probably a lot more fluid than we think.

> Whether it involves livestock or people, this sexual-imprinting process (in which a highly circumscribed set of erotic targets is stamped early into the individual’s brain) appears to be a decidedly male characteristic. By contrast, the female sheep and goats that were able to “go both ways” after their intensive cross-rearing experiences, equally aroused by both their own biological kind and members of their adoptive species, were exhibiting “erotic plasticity” (in which one can be sexually excited by a wide range of stimuli). Interestingly enough, erotic plasticity is also strikingly more apparent in human females than it is in human males. Another way to say this is that a girl’s developing sexuality is more fluid or labile (and for once that’s not a pun) than a boy’s; it’s less prone to getting locked onto a specific category of erotic target during childhood. —[[authors/jesse bering|Jesse Bering]], *[[books/perv|Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us]]*

It’s so impossible to get real stats due to the decades/centuries of repression, plus the abysmal state of legit neurological studies on the phenomenon, gendered or no.[^1] But it makes me curious how much is biological or cultural, and if we can ever separate the two.

- see also: if [[notes/disgust is a culture-bound syndrome|disgust is a culture-bound syndrome]], and [[notes/pms and other pathologies are culture-bound syndromes|pms and other pathologies are culture-bound syndromes]], it stands to reason that our sense of the erotic is culturally influenced too
