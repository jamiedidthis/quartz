> What’s really fascinating is that hate is actually fueled by our need for connection. I call this *common enemy intimacy*. I may not know anything about you, but we hate the same people and that creates a counterfeit bond and a sense of belonging. I say “counterfeit” because the bond and belonging are not real, they hinge on my agreeing with you and not challenging the ideas that connect us. That’s not true belonging.
