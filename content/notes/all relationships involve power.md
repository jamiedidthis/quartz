Every relationship involves a power exchange, and learning the dynamics of power exchanges can be key to navigating relationships in general—and I’d argue *life* in general. It gets a hell of a lot easier to spot abuse and control.

> Just as all power relationships are relationships, all relationships also involve power. The power exchange relationships that we create are different only in that the power is explicit and intentional. But power is present in all kinds of relations between all people. And what that means is that learning the ins and outs of power relationships can make you better at navigating relationships in general. —[[authors/anton fulmen|Anton Fulmen]], *[[books/the dominance playbook|The Dominance Playbook*]]
