[[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]] has an excellent essay in Reactor Mag (formerly Tor) about the psychological and manipulative tactics of preventing free speech, and thus tools for thinking about free speech: https://reactormag.com/tools-for-thinking-about-censorship/

The whole thing is excellent and worth a read, but I wanted to copy down her five takeaways below: 

- The majority of censorship is self-censorship or middleman-censorship, but the majority of that is deliberately cultivated by an outside power.
- For this reason, we *cannot* consider state and non-state censorship separate things. State censorship systems work dominantly via shaping and causing private censorship. 
- No real censoring body has ever had the resources of Orwell’s fictitious Ministries—not even the Inquisition or the great totalitarian powers of modernity like the USSR, but they want us to think they do. *Real* censorship regimes tend to see themselves as constantly underfunded and understaffed, racing to grapple overwhelming crises, while attempting to seem all-reaching and all-knowing as a part of their own propaganda. We must analyze their actions remembering that the need to conserve resources and seem stronger than they are shapes everything they do. 
- Censorship aims to be visible, talked about, seen, feared. This increases its power. 
- Censors’ projection of fear and power is a form of deliberate psychological manipulation which can outsource censorship far beyond the censor’s sphere of control, even to citizens of other nations. We can only combat it if we work hard to cut through the Orwellian illusion and remember the realities of how censorship works.

- see also: [[notes/the most hideous ideologies are the ones we believe without realizing it|the most hideous ideologies are the ones we believe without realizing it]] — this definitely goes for the “authoritarian school of social change”
- note: I think a lot more goes into subtle censorship than this indicates, as in limiting what’s open to debate, keeping ideas off limits, dictating reality through repetition, etc. That veers more into psychological manipulation than outright censorship, but the effect is the same. Explore that more—Overton Window, psychological conditioning, *[[books/propaganda blitz|Propaganda Blitz]]*, etc.
