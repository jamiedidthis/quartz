Over on Sluggish, Jesse Meadows is talking about people getting ruffled “[because everyone online is autistic now](https://sluggish.substack.com/p/why-is-everyone-online-autistic-now).” It’s just the latest hand-wringing over autism as an internet trend (or insert any “-ism as an internet trend”), and the key argument is that the right people aren’t getting what they deserve, while “fakers” are taking resources away.

> And there’s that word, the one that crops up all the time in a world defined by scarcity.

Deserve. Some deserve, some don’t. What could be common ground becomes a fight for resources, rejecting people with varying levels of need because of the belief that there isn’t enough to go around.

bell hooks calls it “[[the capitalist notion of well-being]],” the belief that the good life can only be had by a few. Meadows cites the book *Health Communism*, tracing the deserving/non-deserving binary back to the early days of [[English Poor Laws]], which had to source the “surplus population” (look at that language already) into increasingly marginal, verifiable categories. Some citizens were “deserving,” while others were treated as waste, a strain on the productive (taxpaying) community who were the *real* sovereign citizens.

> The worker is told to beware of the degenerate influence of the surplus population and to root out those who would fraudulently claim state or private benefits as surplus; ==we are deputized by the state to surveil and judge others’ worthiness for aid.== *(Health Communism)*

(Note: big overlap with religion too! Hence the [[theology of capitalism]].)

What can we do? Stop believing [[notes/myth of scarcity]]. Reject this limited, binary framing. Recognize our solidarity. Refuse to be pitted against each other. [[notes/tell different stories|Tell different stories]].
