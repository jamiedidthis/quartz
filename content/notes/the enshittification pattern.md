Cory Doctorow on [the enshittification of TikTok](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/): 

> Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.
> 
> I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a “two sided market,” where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, raking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them.

Part of that has to be about consuming vs. creating. Kyle Chayka, in his essay [Why the Internet Isn’t Fun Anymore](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/why-the-internet-isnt-fun-anymore), says: 

> According to Eleanor Stern, a TikTok video essayist with nearly a hundred thousand followers, part of the problem is that social media is more hierarchical than it used to be. “There’s this divide that wasn’t there before, between audiences and creators,” Stern said. The platforms that have the most traction with young users today—YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch—function like broadcast stations, with one creator posting a video for her millions of followers; what the followers have to say to one another doesn’t matter the way it did on the old Facebook or Twitter. [[notes/social media is the third place|Social media “used to be more of a place for conversation and reciprocity,”]] Stern said. Now conversation isn’t strictly necessary, only watching and listening.

I’m not quite as doom and gloom as all that… everything has its life cycle, and a bunch of people tired of the consuming part are starting to [make the internet weird again](https://www.anildash.com//2024/01/03/human-web-renaissance/).
