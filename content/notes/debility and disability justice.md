In *[[books/the right to maim|The Right to Maim]]*, [[authors/jasbir k. puar|Jasbir Puar]] uses the concept of “debility”—bodily injury and social exclusion brought on by economic and political factors—to disrupt the category of disability and the neoliberal concept of disability justice.

> Puar uses the term debilitation to describe what happens to Mohammed and so many others in Gaza that our neoliberal frame of disability rights can’t capture. She explains that debility can’t be understood as an identity like disability, which is usually thought of as an event that happens to an individual, after which they just need accommodations, access, and personal empowerment to be included in society. Rather, debility is what happens when a state makes an entire population available for mass injury — a denial of disability rights altogether.[^1]

This leads to cognitive dissonance and egregious hypocrisy, where a state perpetuating *genocide* can nonetheless claim themselves a champion of disability justice within that framework of disability rights:

> Israel is, in fact, a signatory on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The IDF proudly claims to be the world’s largest employer of [[notes/autism|autistic people]], and in August, an ambassador told the UN that Israel is committed to eliminating ableism. But this disability rights frame, which for a long time, has been led and theorized by white disabled people who live in the US and Europe, doesn’t map onto the experiences of racialized groups who are targeted en masse by the state.[^2]

It’s back to that same concept of [[notes/worthy victims|worthy victims]] and [[notes/who is more deserving|who is deserving]]. The [entire essay from Jesse Meadows](https://sluggish.substack.com/p/what-does-disability-justice-mean) is worth a read. 

> When repression is globalized, our solidarity must be, too.
