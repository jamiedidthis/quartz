We are not tending language like a garden—its order is emerging from the chaos in a natural way.

> When we thought of language like a book, we thought of it as an unruly mess of words that had to be kept in order, like a Victorian gardener constantly retrimming the hedges into spirals and globes. When we think of language like a network, we can see order as a thing that emerges out of the natural tendencies of the individuals, the way that a forest keeps itself in order even though it doesn’t get pruned and weeded. —[[authors/gretchen mcculloch|Gretchen McCulloch]], *[[books/because internet|Because Internet]]*
