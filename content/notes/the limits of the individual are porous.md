As a fan of pro cycling, one of the most amazing things is watching the peloton guide along the tarmac at breathtaking speeds, a living organism that is unquestionably more than the sum of its parts.[^1]

> Its cohesion is so real that the limits of the individual are porous. Skewered by the marrow, every rider sheds some blood in the melting pot of the peloton’s formidable heart, puts existence and breath at the service of the monster with a hundred mouths. Even when you consider those who ride apart from one another, the effort of a rider is never totally independent from the efforts of all the others.

It’s one thing to watch a flock of starlings or school of minnows, it’s another thing altogether to watch a couple hundred flesh and blood humans on machines do it.
