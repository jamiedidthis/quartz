Top-down thinkers have a linear thought process, a deductive approach, a “concept-before-the-details” type brain. 

Bottom-up thinkers have an associative thought process, an inductive approach, a “details-before-the-concept” type brain.

[[notes/autism|Autistic people]] tend to belong overwhelmingly to the second category.[^1] 

Instead of fitting new information into a preexisting box, contextualizing based on prior knowledge–or even constrained by prior knowledge–the autistic mind takes in a bombardment of details and sorts it into a comprehensible picture.

Is this one reason you can give me [[series/terra ignota|Terra Ignota]] or *[[books/harrow the ninth|Harrow the Ninth]]* and I glom it like candy? The whole real world is basically [[notes/puzzle-book worldbuilding|puzzle-book worldbuilding]].
