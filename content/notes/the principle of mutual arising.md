> It is basic to the Taoist view of the world that every thing-event (*shì* 事 or *wù* 物) is what it is only in relation to all others. The earth, and every tiniest thing upon it, inevitably “goes-with” the sun, moon, and stars. It needs them just as much as it needs, and consists of, its own elements. Conversely, the sun would not be light without eyes, nor would the universe “exist” without consciousness—and vice versa. This is the principle of “mutual arising” (*xiāng* 相 *shēng* 生) which is explained in the second chapter of the *[[books/tao te ching|Tao Te Ching]]*. —[[authors/alan watts|Alan Watts]], *[[books/tao the watercourse way|Tao: The Watercourse Way]]*
