Oops, [[notes/individuality is inseparable from community|once again this is analogous]] to [[authors/pyotr kropotkin|Kropotkin’s]] anarchy. If each thing follows its own nature (理 *lǐ*) it will harmonize with all other things following theirs, not by reason of rule imposed from above but by their mutual resonance (應 *yīng*) and interdependence.

> Thus wu-wei (无为 *wúwéi*) as “not forcing” is what we mean by going with the grain, rolling with the punch, swimming with the current, trimming sails to the wind, taking the tide at its flood, and stooping to conquer. It is perhaps best exemplified in the Japanese arts of *judo* and *aikido* where an opponent is defeated by the force of his own attack, and the latter art reaches such heights of skill that I have seen an attacker thrown to the floor without even being touched. —[[authors/alan watts|Alan Watts]], *[[books/tao the watercourse way|Tao: The Watercourse Way]]*

无为而无不为。(《道德经》) 
wúwéi ér wúbùwéi. ( «Dàodéjīng»)
Do nothing and everything is done.

(Or rather, do nothing and let things take their own course. Perhaps the closest translation is *no unnatural, forceful action* instead of no action at all.)

[[authors/ursula k le guin|Ursula K. Le Guin’s]] note for 17 in the *[[books/tao te ching|Tao Te Ching]]*:

> Again, it’s a matter of “doing without doing”: ==uncompetitive, unworried, trustful accomplishment, power that is not force.== An example or analogy might be a very good teacher, or the truest voice in a group of singers.
