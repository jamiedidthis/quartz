The German word vorfruede has no English equivalent. It comes from the words _vor_ (“before”) and _Freude_ (“joy”) and means something along the lines of “joyful anticipation.”

Often “vorfreude” is characterized as childish anticipation. It also includes the tension, impatience, and curiosity of anticipating an event. 

A common German saying is “_Vorfreude ist die schönste Freude_,” which means “anticipation is the greatest joy.”

Like [[mitfreude]], first encountered courtesy of [[ada palmer|Ada Palmer]]’s essay [on anime](http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/a-mitfreude-of-anime-and-mangas-relationship-with-anglophone-science-fiction-or-this-essay-will-not-try-to-get-you-into-anime-and-manga/): 

> Manga and anime are a deep plunge for the unfamiliar, since you need to consume dozens of series to learn the tropes before you can enjoy the best; but their SFF world is part of our SFF world, and hopefully now you can enjoy both the mitfreude of delighting in others’ joy, and the vorfreude of looking forward in future to hearing a friend say, “there’s a cool new SF manga that did X!” and welcoming it as a thread in the tapestry of global fandom.
