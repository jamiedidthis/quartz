Everything is a clue, or a key to unpick the lock. If you’re stuck, trapped, blocked, confused, *that* in itself means you’re already working on it. 

> Like so: the fact that you’ve even identified something as a block means movement is happening. When you hit a wall, that’s literally only happening because you’re trying to move energy in a different direction, walk through a new doorway, or dig a new tunnel. And sometimes you have to jiggle the handle a little or learn how to use a different tool because there’s something new in the way. ==Calling something a “block,” “limit,” or “challenge” is a protest in itself, a statement or declaration that you’re not okay with being constrained in this particular way, and you most certainly do not plan to shape a life around some limitation that really doesn’t need to be there.== —[[authors/jessica dore|Jessica Dore]], *[[books/tarot for change|Tarot for Change]]*

Avoidance and force ain’t gonna work… although that’s a clue too. A gentle, curious approach, like with everything, is a lot more effective. 

> With any kind of block, the first task is to be present enough to notice that it is there—whether it be physical, behavioral, energetic, emotional, or psychological—rather than either avoiding it altogether or trying to muscle through it. Avoidance and forcefulness both seem to have a tendency to make blocks worse, the former by reinforcing a belief that the block is dangerous to make contact with, and the latter by piling on more energy rather than patiently working to clear the existing backlog. Maybe we could remind ourselves that it isn’t dangerous to investigate blocks, but that we can always do so gently, giving ourselves full permission to back off anytime it gets to feel like too much.

> And I think noticing a block is in itself something to celebrate. You might not think so, those around you might not think so, but I think it is, because it’s when you know you’re ready to do the work. Identifying a block means you get to start poking around to find the malleable parts, the parts with some give, where transformation could happen, little by little. As you go, you’ll learn what qualities of mind are best when working with these things. Some that I’ve found helpful when engaging with blocks are ==gentleness, curiosity, humor, and patience.== You’ll see what works for you. ([[books/tarot for change|ibid.]])
