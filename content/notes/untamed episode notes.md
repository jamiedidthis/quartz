My raw notes for *The Untamed*, started when I was trying to make sense of the plot but now an indispensable resource for fic. Lots of shorthand (and emoji feels) so probably useless to anybody but me 🤷🏻‍♀️

## Ep 1
- WWX resurrecting in Jin color robes, lol—cannot fully appreciate the irony of this the first time around 
- Lan clan using the lure flags he made; already innovating 😭
- SZ recognizing Wuji from LWJ playing it in Gusu 😭 (==diegetic Wuji==, “flute”/grass)
	- (ALSO, he would be not realizing he recognizes it from WWX playing it in Burial Mounds)
	- Full moon
- Btw a-Yuan (愿) means “wishes” and Sizhui (思追) means “miss you and chase you,” so basically SZ is a love letter to WWX from LWJ 😭

---
## Ep 2
- Is WWX your dad? / No he’s my idol. 🤣🤣
- Per Jin Ling: Mo Xuanyu didn’t have enough spiritual power to cultivate 
	- “So now you’ve resorted to evil tricks”
	- (Also if JL was smart, here’s how to know it’s not MX—he doesn’t recognize JL or know what happened to his parents)
- LWJ already zapping ppl (JL) trying to hurt WWX
- JC to LWJ in front of WWX: you really are where the trouble is; are you looking for someone; you’ve been a lot of places the last 16 years 
	- (he asks are you looking for someone before he’s really spotted WWX/MX—so this is just a common occurrence / annoyance for him??)
- SZ best boy at diplomacy, doing all the talking for LWJ
- Silence spell for JL 😆 
- LWJ such a good dad: “Go do your work. Just try your best. Don’t force yourselves.” (Especially after JC) 
	- (Beautiful lingering face of [WWX listening to this](https://youtu.be/1tAKFgUXiXg?t=3068) in the special edition)
- LWJ knows it’s WWX, but all about making him feel safe?
- “I thought I could be indifferent to the world, but nobody can repress their feelings after all.” 
- SZ at the Wen graves, doesn’t know that’s his people or where he lived before 😭 
- Jingyi using one of the monster compasses that WWX invented 
	- (*did* he invent it, or did he steal it off that impersonator dude?? lol)
- JL super archery skills like WWX 😭 
- Dancing fairy an illusion to get WWX to summon WN
	- NHS did it; he knew, there when WWX and LWJ sealed her
- Summoning WN: ==diegetic Wuji== (flute)
- Start of flashback: Jiang Yanli says they have **10 days** before the ceremony starts

---
## Ep 3
- FIRST WUJI @ THE ROOFTOP
	- Full moon
- First sword fight, WWX never unsheathes Suibian! Only blocks Bichen

	- Yelling fuddy-duddy when the silence spell breaks 😂 
	- Translates second ‘fuddy-duddy’ as fool
- Snippet of Wuji as WWX realizing LWJ let the fam in
- WWX and LQ actually brainstorming about the puppets together; they’d make a good team 😂 
- LWJ already staring up at the rooftop having mad feels
- Wen Ruohan: “West of Dafan, east of Gusu, north of Yueyang—where is the last shard of Yin Iron?” 
	- (Xue Yang: I’ll tell you where after I get the one in Yueyang)
	- So WR doesn’t know there’s a fifth, and it’s in Xuanwu? But XY does

---
## Ep 4
- LWJ pretty feisty against the Wens—wanting to jump into the fight like WWX, but gets the no from LXC
- The presentation ceremony is the **first day**—WWX telling NHS about the fight with LWJ “last night”
	- WWX already writing lines, lol
	- his first batch is 300, then sentenced to 1000 more 
	- Did 40 copies the first night—but even reading them takes hours in class 
	- 1300/40 = **32.5 days to finish them all** (probably longer because of dawdling, mistakes, earning more punishment, etc.)
- One of the Lan principles: “don’t indulge in pleasure”
- Distracted by NHS’s canary during the “don’t take evil paths” part 😆 
- NHS being the matchmaker with LXC and JGY (still Meng Yao here) just like with WWX and LWJ 😂
- Orchid House = classroom 
	- Check the name of pavilion right after scene w NHS WWX and JC
- When two disciples pass JGY, it’s a Lan + Jiang pair
- Magic tricks for catching fish is no fun

	- Good WWX face @ 22:40ish

- Beautiful smile @ 13:14, not one of the usual ones
- LWJ calls him Wei Ying when talking to LXC
- “Fuddy duddy put me in confinement for **three days**”
	- so the show makes it look like a very short period of time but they’re actually in Cloud Recesses for six months soooo 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
- LWJ: no no no / LXC: so you wanted them to come

- Alllll up in his personal space while LXC smirks
- Wen Ning goes to save Su She, WWX goes to save Wen Ning, LWJ goes to save WWX… seems about right
	- Can’t you just hold me? Here, take my hand! / I don’t touch other people. / But we’re so intimate! / Not close at all. 
- WWX giving WQ the talisman to protect WN… so that’s what he sees on the body in [[notes/untamed episode notes#Ep 26|ep 26]] 😭
- Comb is an emblem of lovesickness
- LWJ: what WWX said is not unreasonable

	- (actually says hey, what’s wrong with me; mistranslation)
- In special edition ep 2, WWX says “to come early is not as good as to come in time” when LWJ comes in, referenced again in [[#Ep 37|ep 37]]
- We killed the aqua demon **today**—so library>Biling Lake>drinking>Yin Iron happens in like 3 days
- In [[#Ep 36|ep 36]] LWJ says he’s never tasted Emperor’s Smile, but he has—but under the spell so doesn’t really count?
	- “I bet no one thought someone high and mighty like you would one day follow my lead.”
	- WWX toast to LWJ: *May we never forget what is worth remembering, or remember what is best forgotten.*
- LXC says **a few days ago** I took some students to Biling Lake; WWX said **yesterday** so they were there a few days?
- You are one of the people I approve. And I wanna be friends… A lot of benefits come with being my friend.

- “Wangji has been diligent since he was a boy, he would never fool around with Wei Wuxian.” —LQ, famous last words, meet your future nephew in law 
	- (literally RIGHT THIS MOMENT LWJ is marrying him in a cave 🤣)
- Hundreds of years ago when the Yin Iron was whole, the **Burial Mounds was a celestial land**
- WWX: if the Yin Iron can absorb natural energy, turn it into a good use / LWJ scolds him but Lan Yi thought the same
	- She tried to break the rules and innovate
	- Lan Yi: I have always done things my way to have a clear conscience
	- Lan Yi: just because it hasn’t been done doesn’t mean it can’t be done

---
## Ep 7
- Saying ancestor in unison, 5:33

- JY and LWJ doing their first tag team to calm WWX the fuck down
	- LWJ calls him Wei Ying to break up the fight

- WWX so unhappy to hear they’re leaving

## Ep 9
- LWJ just lowkey reminding WWX of his insight, that the puppets aren’t dead
- WWX to JC: it was my idea, don’t blame LWJ

- A-Yuan!! Too young to remember WWX and LWJ showing up together 😭

	- How much time has passed??
	- **Dichroa Red liquor of Yueyang** (so this is what LWJ drinks in [[#Ep 35|ep 35]]/[[#Ep 36|36]])
- Big shift in LWJ through here; done playing it cool, done even trying to say boring and keep distant 
	- (until the broken leg part, haha, but arguably that’s about sparing WWX more notice/punishment from WC)

---

	- WWX wanting to take the punishment from Jiang Fengmian (different story when LWJ did it tho)

- Big shift in WWX through here too, just totally concerned about/constantly alert to LWJ or Cloud Recesses in danger
	- Kept sending LWJ messages on the way home (communication talisman, or old fashioned way?)
- “To attempt the impossible, do nothing until you achieve something.”

- “Uncle, it is here that predecessor Lan Yi told me we should keep **our** conscience clear.”

---
## Ep 12
- First time LWJ pulls the sword block move to protect WWX??
- His distance now is totally protecting WWX from danger/Wen Chao, not protecting himself from WWX
- NHS faints so he doesn’t make it to Muxi Mountain 😆 

---
## Ep 13

	- Wang Lingjiao = Jiaojiao

- LWJ blocks Mianmian from Wen Chao first; JC holding WWX back

---
## Ep 14

- Xuanwu digests spiritual cognition as well as human flesh
	- It’s LWJ who says it’s just like Yin Iron
	- Flashback to Xue Chonghui; Lan Yi first told them about Xuanwu
- Is this a flashback within a flashback now? (The song?) It’s WWX memories as LWJ hums, right? Or no…it’s just LWJ emotions/memories via the song??
	- ==First diegetic Wuji, right??== (Except for [[#Ep 1|ep 1]]–[[#Ep 2|2]] of course, but that’s out of order)
	- Also “his memory is bad” but he is remembering allll of this
	- Can remember Wuji note by note from hearing it *once* while he was half conscious

- Wen Chao and Wen Xu
- Madam Yu = Yu Ziyuan (aka Purple Spider)
- TOTALLY a kiss, look at that drawing on the bed

## Ep 16
- JC to WWX: why couldn’t you just let LWJ and JZ die?
- Over 2400 spiritual tools at Lotus Pier
- Fight w/ JC at dawn, wake up ~noon, find JL, WWX rows them down the river, JC goes back that night or next night? So still close to Lotus Pier? Where are they hiding?
	- JC doesn’t lose his golden core until he goes back and is tortured, right? (per his mom, who checks his pulse and says he’ll recover from the first blow)

	- Who is watching when JC comes off the mountain? Just a Wen soldier?
- **Three months later** 
- Thought he went to find you **in Lanling**
- LWJ takes Suibian instead of JC; only a lover allowed to do that, it would have caused rumors?

- Raided the Indoctrination Bureau at Nightless City (aka Nevernight)
	- So this is the same as Qishan bureau, right?? Nightless City is in Qishan?

- LWJ doesn’t know the difference in WWX is trauma not evil 
	- Wei Ying, don’t joke (so he gets at least some of it is put on) 
- Ancestral shrine w/ JC, tells Madam Yu he’s kept his promise to protect JY and JC 😭

---
## Ep 21

	- This is how long it takes WWX with WN? And how he knows it can be done?
- LWJ + JY tag team to calm WWX the fuck down (Mianmian standing up for JY too 😭)
- LXC: we’re fighting with our backs against the wall, no way back
	- “Qishan is as hard as an iron cask, but can be penetrated with water.”
	- Jin Guangyao is who hides LXC after Cloud Recesses burns 😭

	- LXC still best brother 😭 
	- LXC: if you trust us, we can help you pick up your sword arts again / WWX: I trust you, but I don’t want to pick it up
	- Maybe I am the prodigy (echoing Lan Yi frpm [[#Ep 6|ep 6]])
- WWX and JY—tear running down his face resting on her knee, when he starts joking about being hungry, but then asking about liking someone so much

- Heal from the stab wound in seven days; JC’s broken arm in plaster **for over a month** (WWX: it’s usually three months for injuring bones, one month isn’t that long)
- When reminiscing, replays the lantern vow w/ only WWX angle
	- In the special edition, his reminiscing is almost all LWJ-oriented; the only real clue here is musing on the name Rulan
	- Full moon

- WQ calls him Wei Ying during last convo in the cave 😭

- WWX: Explain how I manipulated WN to kill in Jinlintai when I was a **thousand miles away**
	- More than 30 innocent people died on Qiongqi road / More than 10 innocent Wen cultivators died in Burial Mounds
- Do you really consider yourself such a great man for disregarding universal condemnation?
- Different flute song when it’s against LWJ??
	- Full moon

---
## Ep 33
- ==Diegetic Wuji as WWX wakes up== (qin)
- JC (says he) searched for WWX’s body, LWJ couldn’t for **three more years** 😭 
	- (According to the [LWJ character song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FukKOKBlzvk), he keeps searching by playing “Inquiring for the Soul” with no answer 😭😭😭)
- Echoing the “16 years ago” line (Netflix captions get it wrong)
- Bruised lip in resurrection/bed scene—can see it in the flashback on Jinlintai steps in [[#Ep 42|ep 42]]
- Memories from [[#Ep 7|ep 7]]—“I desire equivalence, he is my match”

- JL actually saves him; he’ll be a good kid away from his uncles

---
## Ep 35
- Beginning is even more poignant after JC’s accusation in previous ep. *Knows* LWJ would *never* 😭 
- Full moon, LWJ watching it before piggyback ride
	- Full moon at Mo Manor too, when WWX resurrects—so it’s only been 1-3 days, when moon could still look full. Or a month? (Implausible.) Or just artistic licence, lol
- It’s called a sword ghost before the scene w/ NHS in the tomb where he corrects them that the Nie practice blades not swords; called blade spirit after that 
- WWX thinks someone might have brought him back to frame him
	- So JC wasn’t wrong, only wrong about it being LWJ, haha
- **Yueyang, Qiting wine house** (same as [[#Ep 9|ep 9]])
- Xue Yang appearing 16 years ago, but pardoned by JGS (“it was only 50 people”) 
	- Right after killing WWX for “only 50 people”
	- LWJ having to endure this while in isolation with WWX dead—the injustice

---
## Ep 36
- WN calls the new flute Chenqing—he’s the only one though? A slip? It’s not supposed to be Chenqing until JC gives it back in [[#Ep 49|ep 49]], right?
- Ok, so they go from in town to the woods because they’re combining like three drunk scenes from the book together, and have to do the marriage proposal chickens—otherwise it makes no sense how they “get lost” from standing right in front of the inn 😆

- Fairy bit Apple, Apple kicked Fairy—now neither of them can move lolll
	- Jingyi very much Team Apple

- XY confessing that he has the last Yin Iron piece (but not from Chang clan); knows WWX got the fifth one from Xuanwu
	- WWX says congrats for being smart enough to set him up so everybody thought he had the missing piece
- “Wen Ning is not a thing”
- To LWJ: “Should I call this, ‘to come in time is better than to come early?’” (see note for [[#Ep 6|ep 6]])
- All the little ducklings surrounding him @ 37:00 ☺️
	- When they ask WWX, Low-key, right?
	- Waving, it’s up to you now! @ 38:58
- WWX is the one saying “there’s no need”
- “Empathy” is the “wicked trick”… irony

---

	- WWX bopping the rabbit lantern with his flute while they walk into the frame 😂
- WWX looking at LWJ when LXC describing NMJ—he was gone, I prepared myself for the worst
- LXC: All of these events happened within the past month, when he was with me every night 👀 
- SZ to JL: a person of demonic cultivation doesn’t necessarily use the power to do evil (LWJ’s influence?)

---
## Ep 40
- Ooyang saying JL returns to Jinlintai **tomorrow**
- Jingyi calling JL Young Mistress Jin 
	- (wasn’t there to hear WWX in [[#Ep 37|ep 37]], so who picks it up from the other?)
- In the novel, Jingyi dropping the chicken wing isn’t because LWJ is carrying liquor, but because drunk LWJ ties up WWX with his forehead ribbon and hauls him upstairs 
- SZ has a finger tattoo! 😆
- The conference @ Jinlintai **next month**
- Per JC: LWJ has never been to a conference in Jinlintai, “what’s different now?” 😭 LWJ showing his undying loyalty (and picking up WWX’s grudges)
- LWJ saying suibian, “whatever,” when WWX is worried about how he’ll have to bluff 
	- In youtube version: “I’m just afraid of losing you face.”
	- WWX already in the food before JGY can make his speech
- Is that Bacao, the maid from [[#Ep 45|eps 45]]–[[#Ep 46|46]] with Qin Su?

- LWJ is *so soft* toward WWX, definitely some boning down happened over those drinks and during that month
- Staying in the same room where LQ lectured him about WWX being evil like his mother

---
## Ep 41
- WWX knows JGY swapped the music, he confesses in the Empathy with NMJ. So when WWX plays it, he’s giving LX the evidence to “discover” on his own instead of just telling him?
- LWJ (and WWX) bitchy greeting to Su She

---
## Ep 42
- LXC: Gusu disciples were on a night hunt **in Yiling** when they passed Mo’s Manor…
- LWJ: Hands off. / Su She: *You* should keep your hands off. 😂 
- Su She not back on his bullshit—he stays on his bullshit
- Sacrificial curse: a trick for healing those who are severely wounded at the cost of one’s entire spiritual cognition (special edition captions)
	- So sacrifice summon was a Yiling-laozhu idea? Or maybe with his manuscripts, bc something obscure he found? In Wen manuscripts? Collab w WQ? Or actually a Jin document but trying to pin it on him?
- Good memory: immediately remembers what LWJ asked him in Cloud Recesses
	- In special edition it’s “trust” instead of “believe in”
- “Lan Zhan, you fuddy-duddy,” with great affection when LWJ won’t leave his side
- According to the book, curse mark on WWX’s leg is lifted by the time he’s stabbed
- NHS has the body, so this is when he puts it in the temple coffin??

---

	- “You are not privileged to talk to me.”
	- JGY coming from *inside* the cave
	- JGY: even if WWX happens to survive… so they’re not sure he’s dead 
- LXC not there while he’s punished—doesn’t agree, or simply not in Cloud Recesses??
	- The ends of LWJ forehead ribbon bloody from the beating (has been bloody before, after Xuanwu)
- Still secretly took her to Cloud Recesses, married her quietly
- Snow when his mother dies; when punished after Yiling
- In special edition, WWX says “I wouldn’t have asked him to do that” after LXC story
- “Surely it’s too flirtatious to say out loud…” in youtube edition, that’s the line when WWX is trying to say thank you the first time 
- If I were him… but trails off, looking at LWJ 
- You didn’t tell him? On Qiongqi Way, the second flute? / You know? / I asked Wen Ning.
- Lip bruised @ porch scene
- ==Diegetic Wuji== (qin)
- Special edition captions: 
	- “Even if I run out now and scream ‘I was wronged!’ for 100 times, no one would believe me.”
	- LWJ: “Nothing matters. I’ll do what my heart tells me.” / WWX: “Let them slander me and defame me. I’ll do what my heart tells me.”
- Little Apple not wanting to leave Cloud Recesses 😆

	- So right after WWX has heard LWJ play it on the qin (which he heard before in [[#Ep 33|ep 33]], too)

	- JL tells him to shut up when he’s attacking WWX 
	- JL and SZ tied together

	- Blame the silence spell as WWX wicked trick, but no it’s Lan—more of the gray area 
- WWX asks LQ a question, LQ tells him to ask LWJ
	- LWJ watching LQ listen to WWX
	- Jingyi talking back to LQ?? During Su She interrogation 
- At second siege—they can tell their spiritual power is weak (pulse) but looks like only the doctor can say if golden core still intact 
- Since the qin can subdue the evil, why can’t it summon the evil?

---
## Ep 45
- Jingyi wanting to draw the lure flag on himself too 
- JL and SZ fighting puppets together 
- **Lotus Pier nearest to Burial Mounds**
- He’s like a brother and a father to me, taught me how to play qin 😭

## Translation notes
]- Cloud Recesses also translated “Where the Clouds Retreat”
- Hanguang Jun, also *one who possesses the light*
- Bichen, also “Eluding the Dust of the Mortal World”
- Liebing is the name of Lan Xichen’s flute. The name means Cracked Ice
- Btw Lan Yuan (愿) means “wishes” and Lan Si Zhui (思追) means “miss you and chase you”, so basically Si Zhui is a love letter to Wei Ying from Lan Zhan
- *chenqingling*, anything from “a song to explain myself” or “a song of past relationships” or “a song to command the world”
- *chenqing*… to lay out my feelings, *to reveal myself fully*, to express the song of my heart …
