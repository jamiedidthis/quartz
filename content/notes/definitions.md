> “Definitions are vital starting points for the imagination. What we cannot imagine cannot come into being. A good definition marks our starting point and lets us know where we want to end up.” *(bell hooks, All About Love)*

There is no way to get rid of your emotional power of anger. **Anger** is self-preserving and self-protective energy. Without this energy you become a doormat and a people-pleaser. (John Bradshaw, Healing the Shame that Binds You)

**Anger** is the deepest form of compassion, for another, for the world, for the self, for a life, for the body, for a family, and for all our ideals, all vulnerable and all, possibly about to be hurt. (David Whyte, Consolations)

I think of the **sacred** as being an interruption in scheduled programming. It’s like an inconvenience. It’s a category violation. ([Sophie Strand](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcXsXFOOd2X/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=))

**True love** allows, honors, and appreciates; attachment grasps, demands, needs, and aims to possess. (Jack Kornfield via [[books/atlas of the heart]])

This is one way of speaking about **mindfulness**, or being present: *coming home to ourselves.* (Kaira Jewel Lingo, We Were Made for These Times)

**Privacy:** the right people know the right info
**Secrecy:** the right people don’t know the right info

**Despair** is a necessary and seasonal state of repair, a temporary healing absence, an internal physiological and psychological winter when our previous forms of participation in the world take a rest; it is a loss of horizon, it is the place we go when we do not want to be found in the same way anymore. (David Whyte, Consolations)

I mean what is **witchcraft** but just saying things out loud and hoping something happens (via [dar.kacademia](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdioTkgoCmC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==))

**Virginity** is the quality of belonging to oneself. ([Jeanna Kadlec](https://jeannakadlec.substack.com/p/the-new-moon-in-virgo-for-writers))

**Abuse** = someone treats you as an object they are willing to harm for their own benefit. (Wade Mullen, Something’s Not Right)

**Pain** is the doorway to the here and now. (David Whyte, Consolations)

“For ordinary **self-control** is the domination of one’s behavior by the selfish self: its love is assumed, pretensive, and dutiful; its righteousness is hypocritical; its chastity issues in cruelty; its spiritual ideals are highbrow ways of inflating the ego; its profuse confessions of sin are subtle ways of one-upping more ordinary people; and its beneficence has an odd way of arousing resentment in its recipients.” (Alan Watts, Cloud-Hidden, Whereabouts Unknown)

**Suffering** is just the refusal to accept what is. That’s it. Etymologically, it comes from the Latin word to “from below to bear.” Or, to “resist, endure, put under.” So **healing** is really just letting yourself feel. (Brianna Wiest, 101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think)

**Integrity**: ensuring that my inner self and outer self are integrated. Integrity means having only one self. Dividing into two selves—the shown self and the hidden self—that is brokenness, so I do whatever it takes to stay whole. I do not adjust myself to please the world. I am myself wherever I am, and I let the world adjust. (Glennon Doyle, Untamed)

**Morality** isn’t “out there” in the world; it’s a *way of seeing*, and it’s constantly evolving. (Jesse Bering, Perv)

I define **spirituality** as the deeply held belief that we are inextricably connected to each other by something greater than ourselves. I have friends who are atheists who every day practice inextricable connection—they hurt when others hurt and they know that none of us are free until all of us are free. I have friends who talk endlessly about their religion and wear scripture on their T-shirts, yet demonstrate no connection to anyone’s suffering but their own and maybe that of the people in their immediate circle. I make this point because we’re not talking about religion here. We’re talking about the irrepressible human spirit. (Brene Brown, [[books/atlas of the heart|Atlas of the Heart]])
