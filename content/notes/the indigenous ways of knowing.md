> Native scholar Greg Cajete has written that in indigenous ways of knowing, ==we understand a thing only when we understand it with all four aspects of our being: mind, body, emotion, and spirit.== I came to understand quite sharply when I began my training as a scientist that science privileges only one, possibly two, of those ways of knowing: mind and body. As a young person wanting to know everything about plants, I did not question this. But it is a whole human being who finds the beautiful path.

> There was a time when I teetered precariously with an awkward foot in each of two worlds—the scientific and the indigenous. But then I learned to fly. Or at least try. It was the bees that showed me how to move between different flowers—to drink the nectar and gather pollen from both. ==It is this dance of cross-pollination that can produce a new species of knowledge, a new way of being in the world.== After all, there aren’t two worlds, there is just this one good green earth. —[[authors/robin wall kimmerer|Robin Wall Kimmerer]], *[[books/braiding sweetgrass|Braiding Sweetgrass]]*
