One of the most valuable things I learned in therapy is how to define my own core values and principles. Get very clear on what drives you, and what you believe in as a set of *principles*, not ideology, and then use that as your guide to navigate the world. 

*Every* ideology, even the good ones, can lead you astray or make you betray yourself. Clearly defining and navigating by those values makes it so much harder to get trapped in ideology or swept off with the herd. Or for abusers or manipulators to muddle your mind.
