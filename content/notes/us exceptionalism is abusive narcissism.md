Exceptionalism has come to represent *superiority* in the minds and hearts of Americans, and belief in their economic, military and ideological supremacy is what has motivated successive US governments to shape the world in their “superior” image with no regard for the destruction left in the wake of their _exceptional_ hegemony.

And hey, what’s that by any other name? Pathological abuse. 

> We are currently seeing the transformation of US exceptionalism into an abusive narcissism.
> 
> The gargantuan apparatus of mind bending and controlling is being put into hyper drive by the ruling elite. We are inundated with propaganda that challenges our sense of reality but only after being “tenderized” by the fear factor. Fear of “terror”, fear of war, fear of financial insecurity, fear of gun violence, fear of our own shadow. Once we are suitably quaking in our boots, in comes the rendition of reality that relieves our anxiety. If we challenge this version of events we are labelled a conspiracy theorist, a threat to security. We are hounded, discredited, slandered and ridiculed. We are isolated and *threatened*. —Vanessa Beeley, [Gaslighting: State Mind Control and Abusive Narcissism](https://21stcenturywire.com/2016/05/26/gaslighting-state-mind-control-and-abusive-narcissism/)

Beeley connects it directly to the [[notes/the three stages of gaslighting|gaslighting]] necessary to [[books/manufacturing consent|manufacture consent]] for war. No one in their right mind would agree to maiming, killing, and starving people the world over, so the following story unfolds: 

1. a ubiquitous evil dictator threatens all the US claims to represent, which is of course freedom, equality and civil liberty all wrapped up in the Democracy shiny paper and tied with the exceptionalist ribbon
2. a false flag engenders fear, terror, and foments sectarian strife, all of which is sold in the name of freedom and democracy to a public that is already in a state of anxiety and insecurity, lacking in judgement or insight into any other reality beyond what they’re told by their government and the media
3. the “good guys” are deployed — in come the saviors, the troops, the NGOs, the humanitarians. Now the public can leave their doubts and fears in trustworthy hands and assuage their deep sense of guilt, not realizing that NGOs are the integral part of the apparatus, operating on the leash of neo-colonialist financing and influence

> In this state of oppressed consciousness the victim accepts what they are told. They accept that the US can sell cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia that obliterate human beings and lay waste to essential civilian infrastructure in Yemen. They accept that the US financially, ideologically & militarily supports the illegal state of Israel and provides the arsenal of experimental weapons that maim and mutilate children and civilians on a scale that is unimaginable. They accept that a crippling blockade of the already impoverished and starving nation of Yemen is “necessary” to resolve the issues of sectarian divisions that only exist in the minds of their Congressional abusers.
> 
> The majority of Americans accept mass murder under the pretext of the _right to protect_, because their ability to form rational and reasoned opinions has been engineered out of them. This is now the definition of US exceptionalism. It is their ability to manipulate the world into accepting their lawlessness and global hegemony agenda. In seeking to impose its own image upon our world the US has drifted so far from its founding principles, one wonders how they will ever return to them. They have employed a recognised form of torture to ensure capitulation to their mission of world domination which entails the mental, physical and spiritual torture of target civilian populations. —[ibid.](https://21stcenturywire.com/2016/05/26/gaslighting-state-mind-control-and-abusive-narcissism/)

The US has indeed achieved exceptionalism—an exceptional level of global and domestic abuse. But breaking the cycle of that abuse is just like breaking any other cycle: bring as much awareness to it as possible. Get clear on what’s happening, take back your will, and refuse to be complicit. [[notes/how to beat a manipulator|Beat the manipulators at their game]] by opening your eyes.
