We are not the result of evolution, or the big bang, or a consequence of the physical universe, we are the process of it. That we are separate is an illusion we’ve invented ourselves.

> If there was a big bang at the beginning of time, you are not something that is the *result* of that explosion at the end of the process. You *are* the process.
> 
> You are the big bang. You are the original force of the universe manifesting as whoever you are in the moment. You define yourself as Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. So-and-So, but you’re actually the primordial energy of the universe that’s still in process. It’s just that you learned to define yourself as something separate. —[[authors/alan watts|Alan Watts]], *[[books/out of your mind|Out of Your Mind]]
