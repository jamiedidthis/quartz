The Greeks had two different conceptions of time: chronos (quantitative, linear) and kairos (qualitative, nonlinear). 

Ancient Indians had a similar conception of time: kala (quantitative) and ritu (qualitative). 

[[notes/deep time|Deep time]] (also called geological time, cosmological time, or radiological time) involves the time scale of geologic events, which is incomparably vast compared to the time scale of human history.

[[notes/seasonal time|Seasonal time]] belongs more to the qualitative sense of time, where things are allowed to ebb and flow with their seasons instead of hewing to the abstraction of hours, minutes, or a 7-day week.
