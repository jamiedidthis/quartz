Play gives meaning to life, wrote the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga back in 1938. He christened us [[books/homo ludens|homo ludens]]—‘playing man.’ Everything we call ‘culture,’ said Huizinga, originates in play.[^1]

Almost all mammals play, and many other animals can’t resist. It’s the most intelligent animals that exhibit the most playful behavior. Domesticated animals play their whole lives.

> The opposite of play is not work. The opposite of play is depression. —psychologist Brian Sutton-Smith

Fear destroys curiosity and playfulness. In order to have a healthy society we must raise children who can safely play and learn. [^2]
