Mitfreude is feeling joy in another’s joy. The opposite of schadenfreude, where pleasure is derived from another’s misfortune.

Coined by Nietzsche in 1878,[^1] it originates in the German language, mit (“with”) + Freude (“joy”).

First encountered in [[ada palmer|Ada Palmer]]’s essay on anime, [A Mitfreude of Anime and Manga’s Relationship with Anglophone Science Fiction)](http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/a-mitfreude-of-anime-and-mangas-relationship-with-anglophone-science-fiction-or-this-essay-will-not-try-to-get-you-into-anime-and-manga/), where she defines it as the joy of sharing joy with friends.

> The aim is mitfreude, to share the niftiness of this media world, and hopefully some [[vorfreude]], the joy of anticipating future joy, for example, looking forward to a party or a holiday, preparing for a convention, savoring the smell of something in the oven, or, in this case, knowing that, forever after reading this, you’ll get more richness out of every time somebody mentions anime and manga, because you’ll smile thinking of your lizard-loving friend.

Basically the same concept as [[compersion]], right? Just more broadly applied?
