More women tend to be bisexual, or fluid with how they label their sexuality. Some of the conflict between saying sexuality is a choice might be this erotic plasticity.

> In fact, women in general are far more likely than men to report being bisexual. Tellingly, they’re also more likely to change their self-identification as straight or gay during their adult lives. Furthermore, lesbians are more likely than gay men to say that their sexual orientation is a “choice,” a term that really only makes sense, of course, if the individual is in fact bisexual and decides to commit to one label or another. (Incidentally, if an antigay bigot genuinely believes homosexuality is an intentional choice or a “lifestyle,” then it stands to reason that person’s frequent use of such words could very well be a linguistic reflection of his or her own bisexual desires.) —[[authors/jesse bering|Jesse Bering]], *[[books/perv|Perv: The Sexual Deviant in All of Us]]*
