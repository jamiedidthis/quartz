Instead, he spoke for an alternative school of Darwinism that emerged in Russia, emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change.</description></item><item><title>Sensoria</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sensoria/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sensoria/</guid><description>The tragic side of life is never far away. The least we can do is listen to the pain of others and speak in measured tones of one another’s small achievements of wit, grace, and insight.

Sade the philosopher is in force, and his treatises — like his other novels delivered by key characters — are interspersed with the sex and violence one expects.</description></item><item><title>Justine, Philosophy in the Bedroom, and Other Writings</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justine-philosophy-in-the-bedroom-and-other-writings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justine-philosophy-in-the-bedroom-and-other-writings/</guid><description>Thank you, [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]]. I had my suspicions about Sade, that more was going on than just some shock and awe erotica, and in [[books/too like the lightning|Too Like The Lightning]], when he becomes part of the dialogue in a key way, she makes it clear that to read Sade as sadism is too narrow a view.</description></item><item><title>Six Memos for the Next Millennium</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/six-memos-for-the-next-millennium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/six-memos-for-the-next-millennium/</guid><description>At this rate, this is the year of [[authors/ursula k le guin|Ursula]] and Italo rearranging my thoughts, not to mention my reading and writing.</description></item><item><title>The Prince</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-prince/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-prince/</guid><description>Non-negotiable: read [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer’s]] five-part (plus?) series on Machiavelli. I’ll wait. She makes sense of the enigma, the real Machiavelli, neither lionized nor maligned. The brave thinker; the frightened statesman. Charismatic, unorthodox, forming a response to the Borgia tyranny, trying to save his beloved Florence, playing pranks on the monks, centuries ahead of his time.</description></item><item><title>The Cyclist and His Shadow</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-cyclist-and-his-shadow/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jul 2024 12:40:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-cyclist-and-his-shadow/</guid><description>I like how right away, in the forward, Thomazeau François is pitting this book against [[books/the rider|The Rider]] as the seminal classic of cycling literature. I arched a skeptical eyebrow, and… was in total agreement by like, chapter 3.
Brilliant. Insane. Philosophical. Spiritual. Erotic. I read it during the nearly-hallucinatory six hours of Milan—San Remo and feel like bits of it have embedded in my brain like gravel, because I think of it every time I watch a race.</description></item><item><title>Meditations</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/meditations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:15:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/meditations/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Emergent Strategy</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/emergent-strategy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/emergent-strategy/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Origins of Totalitarianism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 15:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Consolations</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/consolations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 14:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/consolations/</guid><description>Profound devotional.
