I arched a skeptical eyebrow, and… was in total agreement by like, chapter 3.
Brilliant. Insane. Philosophical. Spiritual. Erotic. I read it during the nearly-hallucinatory six hours of Milan—San Remo and feel like bits of it have embedded in my brain like gravel, because I think of it every time I watch a race.</description></item><item><title>What is Tao?</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/what-is-tao/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/what-is-tao/</guid><description/></item><item><title>When Things Fall Apart</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/when-things-fall-apart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/when-things-fall-apart/</guid><description/></item><item><title>On Palestine</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-palestine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-palestine/</guid><description>Many of the world’s problems are so intractable that it’s hard to think of ways even to take steps toward mitigating them.
The Israel-Palestine conflict is not one of these.
I admit I’ve fallen prey to the line, re: the occupation of Palestine, “it’s too complex to understand.</description></item><item><title>Gothic Tales</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gothic-tales/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gothic-tales/</guid><description>Turns out I’ve read most of these stories before, but it makes sense to repackage them here for their gothic themes and add a pleasing cover. My hope springs eternal, with each new edition, that Sade gets placed in his rightful political context, his radical philosophy that’s more dangerous than any pornography.</description></item><item><title>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-vindication-of-the-rights-of-woman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-vindication-of-the-rights-of-woman/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/compulsory-heterosexuality-and-lesbian-existence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/compulsory-heterosexuality-and-lesbian-existence/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Leviathan</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/leviathan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/leviathan/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Metaphors We Live By</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/metaphors-we-live-by/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/metaphors-we-live-by/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mutual Aid</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mutual-aid/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mutual-aid/</guid><description>In an explicit riposte to social Darwinists, Kropotkin argues against the theories that emphasize competition and survival of the fittest, and against the romantic depictions by writers such as [[authors/jean-jacques rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who thought that cooperation was motivated by universal love. Instead, he spoke for an alternative school of Darwinism that emerged in Russia, emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change.</description></item><item><title>Sensoria</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sensoria/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sensoria/</guid><description>The tragic side of life is never far away.

Sade the philosopher is in force, and his treatises — like his other novels delivered by key characters — are interspersed with the sex and violence one expects.</description></item><item><title>Justine, Philosophy in the Bedroom, and Other Writings</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justine-philosophy-in-the-bedroom-and-other-writings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justine-philosophy-in-the-bedroom-and-other-writings/</guid><description>Thank you, [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]]. I had my suspicions about Sade, that more was going on than just some shock and awe erotica, and in [[books/too like the lightning|Too Like The Lightning]], when he becomes part of the dialogue in a key way, she makes it clear that to read Sade as sadism is too narrow a view.</description></item><item><title>Six Memos for the Next Millennium</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/six-memos-for-the-next-millennium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/six-memos-for-the-next-millennium/</guid><description>At this rate, this is the year of [[authors/ursula k le guin|Ursula]] and Italo rearranging my thoughts, not to mention my reading and writing.</description></item><item><title>The Prince</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-prince/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-prince/</guid><description>Non-negotiable: read [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer’s]] five-part (plus?) series on Machiavelli. I’ll wait. She makes sense of the enigma, the real Machiavelli, neither lionized nor maligned. The brave thinker; the frightened statesman. Charismatic, unorthodox, forming a response to the Borgia tyranny, trying to save his beloved Florence, playing pranks on the monks, centuries ahead of his time.</description></item><item><title>Meditations</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/meditations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 15:15:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/meditations/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Emergent Strategy</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/emergent-strategy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/emergent-strategy/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Origins of Totalitarianism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 15:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Consolations</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/consolations/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 14:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/consolations/</guid><description>Re-read 11/24 – 12/24.
I picked this up last month after [[books/forest of noise|Forest of Noise]], when a full year of ongoing genocide seemed to pass without fanfare. Despair is a necessary and seasonal state of repair, Whyte writes. It takes us in when we have nowhere else to go; when we feel the heart cannot break anymore.</description></item><item><title>Out of Your Mind</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/out-of-your-mind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/out-of-your-mind/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
