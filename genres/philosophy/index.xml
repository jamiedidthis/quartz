Le Guin translation (and footnotes!) is everything. Nobody listens to language the way Ursula does. If [[books/kalpa imperial|Kalpa Imperial]] was an ideal pairing between text and translator, this is even more so.
From her introduction:
“It is the most lovable of all the great religious texts, funny, keen, kind, modest, indestructibly outrageous, and inexhaustibly refreshing.</description></item><item><title>Taoism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/taoism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 22:48:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/taoism/</guid><description>As of 1997, [[authors/ursula k le guin|Le Guin]] could claim that the best, soundest, clearest introduction and guide to taoism is still Holmes Welch’s Taoism: The Parting of the Way. (per her translation of the [[books/tao te ching|Tao Te Ching]])
Even where the text is dated, I find it hard to disagree.</description></item><item><title>Cloud-Hidden, Whereabouts Unknown</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/cloud-hidden-whereabouts-unknown/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/cloud-hidden-whereabouts-unknown/</guid><description>And of course the title is an alt phrasing of the line that gets translated as Cloud Recesses in [[series/mo dao zu shi novel|Mó Dào Zǔ Shī]] ☺️

My hope springs eternal, with each new edition, that Sade gets placed in his rightful political context, his radical philosophy that’s more dangerous than any pornography.</description></item><item><title>Juliette</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/juliette/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/juliette/</guid><description>I rarely do this, but there’s another review that says it so well, I’m going to quote it instead of trying to sum up my own thoughts:
Sade the philosopher is in force, and his treatises — like his other novels delivered by key characters — are interspersed with the sex and violence one expects.</description></item><item><title>Justine, Philosophy in the Bedroom, and Other Writings</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justine-philosophy-in-the-bedroom-and-other-writings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justine-philosophy-in-the-bedroom-and-other-writings/</guid><description>Thank you, [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer]]. I had my suspicions about Sade, that more was going on than just some shock and awe erotica, and in [[books/too like the lightning|Too Like The Lightning]], when he becomes part of the dialogue in a key way, she makes it clear that to read Sade as sadism is too narrow a view.</description></item><item><title>Leviathan</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/leviathan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/leviathan/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Minima Moralia</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/minima-moralia/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/minima-moralia/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mutual Aid</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mutual-aid/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mutual-aid/</guid><description>In an explicit riposte to social Darwinists, Kropotkin argues against the theories that emphasize competition and survival of the fittest, and against the romantic depictions by writers such as [[authors/jean-jacques rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who thought that cooperation was motivated by universal love. Instead, he spoke for an alternative school of Darwinism that emerged in Russia, emphasizing cooperation, not competition, as the driver of evolutionary change.</description></item><item><title>No Straight Road Takes You There</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/no-straight-road-takes-you-there/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/no-straight-road-takes-you-there/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Notes from the Edge of the Narrative Matrix</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/notes-from-the-edge-of-the-narrative-matrix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/notes-from-the-edge-of-the-narrative-matrix/</guid><description/></item><item><title>On Palestine</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-palestine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-palestine/</guid><description>Many of the world’s problems are so intractable that it’s hard to think of ways even to take steps toward mitigating them.

I’ll wait. She makes sense of the enigma, the real Machiavelli, neither lionized nor maligned. The brave thinker; the frightened statesman.
