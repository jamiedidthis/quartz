These are real people and real places, not just an abstract Lewis-esque allegory. Now I wish I knew Italian to read his terza rima original, especially since I’ve had to dig through the Longfellow to see what’s underneath.</description></item><item><title>Purgatorio</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/purgatorio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/purgatorio/</guid><description>Reading this alongside Guido Ruggiero’s [[books/the renaissance in italy|The Renaissance in Italy]] is A+ recommended. Once again, vastly more interesting than my first exposure, where school curriculum wanted it read like it was Pilgrim’s Progress. I needed the Bondanella introduction back then to dispense with the nonsense: “Such allegorical abstractions are simply not what Dante’s great poem is all about.</description></item><item><title>Paradiso</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paradiso/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paradiso/</guid><description>My dilemma since the early years of Sunday school: hell is more interesting than paradise. Thus, true to form, though I wanted to be contrary, [[books/inferno|Inferno]] is more interesting than any amount of heavenly light (so bright! so much dancing!), but get to that last line and you can’t help but feel the awe and poetry of it:</description></item><item><title>Taoism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/taoism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 22:48:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/taoism/</guid><description>As of 1997, [[authors/ursula k le guin|Le Guin]] could claim that the best, soundest, clearest introduction and guide to taoism is still Holmes Welch’s Taoism: The Parting of the Way. (per her translation of the [[books/tao te ching|Tao Te Ching]])
Even where the text is dated, I find it hard to disagree.</description></item><item><title>Debt</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/debt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/debt/</guid><description>Here, let me sum it up for you:
Money is pure narrative construct. Debt is pure narrative construct. These things only exist to the extent that we all collectively agree to pretend that the stories about them are true. We are free to collectively end that agreement and create a whole new system at any time.</description></item><item><title>Inventing the Renaissance</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/inventing-the-renaissance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 02:01:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/inventing-the-renaissance/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Woman and Nature</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/woman-and-nature/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 02:01:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/woman-and-nature/</guid><description>If I only remember one thing from this book: the pages and pages of historical milestones interspersed with the timeline of witch trials is a devastatingly powerful thing.</description></item><item><title>A Natural History of Homosexuality</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-natural-history-of-homosexuality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-natural-history-of-homosexuality/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Direct Action</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/direct-action/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/direct-action/</guid><description/></item><item><title>From the River to the Sea</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/from-the-river-to-the-sea/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/from-the-river-to-the-sea/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gathering Moss</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gathering-moss/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gathering-moss/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Justice for Some</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justice-for-some/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/justice-for-some/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mother Night</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mother-night/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mother-night/</guid><description/></item><item><title>On Genocide</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-genocide/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-genocide/</guid><description>Sartre in 1967:
When a peasant falls in his rice paddy, mowed down by a machine gun, every one of us is hit. The Vietnamese fight for all men and the American forces against all. Neither figuratively nor abstractly. And not only because genocide would be a crime universally condemned by international law, but because little by little the whole human race is being subjected to this genocidal blackmail piled on top of atomic blackmail, that is, to absolute, total war.</description></item><item><title>On Palestine</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-palestine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/on-palestine/</guid><description>Many of the world’s problems are so intractable that it’s hard to think of ways even to take steps toward mitigating them.
The Israel-Palestine conflict is not one of these.
I admit I’ve fallen prey to the line, re: the occupation of Palestine, “it’s too complex to understand.</description></item><item><title>Our History Is the Future</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/our-history-is-the-future/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/our-history-is-the-future/</guid><description>An excellent re-issue of a book that&amp;rsquo;s been on my to-read list since it first published in 2019. I&amp;rsquo;m glad it finally prompted me to get to it. It’s the history of two centuries of indigenous activism in the context of even broader indigenous exploitation and resistance, and it needs to be more widely known.</description></item><item><title>Pirate Enlightenment, or the Real Libertalia</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pirate-enlightenment-or-the-real-libertalia/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pirate-enlightenment-or-the-real-libertalia/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sacred Economics</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sacred-economics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sacred-economics/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Slaughterhouse-Five</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/slaughterhouse-five/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/slaughterhouse-five/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Ten Myths About Israel</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ten-myths-about-israel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/ten-myths-about-israel/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Democracy Project</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-democracy-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-democracy-project/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Palestine Laboratory</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-palestine-laboratory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-palestine-laboratory/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dirty Wars</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/dirty-wars/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/dirty-wars/</guid><description>[Insert string of obscenities] at the things the United States has done. The best thing this book does is make it perfectly clear there isn’t right-wing or left-wing. It spans two crucial presidencies (Bush II and Obama), and the substantive difference is that the former worried how far they could push things and the latter did not care.</description></item><item><title>Amazing Asia</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/amazing-asia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/amazing-asia/</guid><description>The “explain it like I’m 5” primer that more people beyond the age of 5 could appreciate.

For example: in trying to locate the so-called “agricultural revolution,” we look only for the traits we expect and overlook anything that doesn’t conform.</description></item><item><title>A History of Gay Literature</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-history-of-gay-literature/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-history-of-gay-literature/</guid><description/></item><item><title>I Ching, the Oracle</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/i-ching-the-oracle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/i-ching-the-oracle/</guid><description>I now understand the I Ching a fraction more than I did before!

Come for the adventure, stay for the fascinating glimpse into Renaissance life and art. I read because [[authors/lois mcmaster bujold|Bujold]] based part of [[books/the spirit ring|The Spirit Ring]] on Cellini and said fact was stranger than fiction… she was not wrong.</description></item><item><title>Machiavelli in Love</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/machiavelli-in-love/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/machiavelli-in-love/</guid><description>Ruggiero does it again: a great companion piece to months of Renaissance reading, including [[authors/niccolo machiavelli|Machiavelli]].</description></item><item><title>The Prince</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-prince/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-prince/</guid><description>Non-negotiable: read [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer’s]] five-part (plus?) series on Machiavelli. I’ll wait. She makes sense of the enigma, the real Machiavelli, neither lionized nor maligned. The brave thinker; the frightened statesman. Charismatic, unorthodox, forming a response to the Borgia tyranny, trying to save his beloved Florence, playing pranks on the monks, centuries ahead of his time.</description></item><item><title>The Renaissance in Italy</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-renaissance-in-italy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-renaissance-in-italy/</guid><description>One of the most accessible yet in-depth histories I’ve read. Lively and engaging. It’s been my tour guide through the past month of [[authors/dante alighieri|Dante]], [[authors/benvenuto cellini|Cellini]], [[authors/niccolo machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[authors/ludovico ariosto|Ariosto]], et. al.

Fabulous stuff. Some fav lines:
—Augustus revived a thing that had barely been invented in his own time: “old-time religion,” rather like the nearly postmodern version of Christianity invented in nineteenth-century America and called “fundamentalism.</description></item><item><title>The Origins of Totalitarianism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 15:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Humankind</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</guid><description>On [[authors/thomas hobbes|Hobbes]] v. [[authors/jean-jacques rousseau|Rousseau]], Bregman sides clearly with Rousseau. I’m more of a mind with [[books/the dawn of everything|The Dawn of Everything]], wondering what we’re excluding by limiting ourselves to that binary. But I also think a little Rousseau-ism is a necessary and overdue corrective.</description></item></channel></rss>
