These are real people and real places, not just an abstract Lewis-esque allegory. Now I wish I knew Italian to read his terza rima original, especially since I’ve had to dig through the Longfellow to see what’s underneath.</description></item><item><title>Purgatorio</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/purgatorio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/purgatorio/</guid><description>Reading this alongside Guido Ruggiero’s [[books/the renaissance in italy|The Renaissance in Italy]] is A+ recommended. Once again, vastly more interesting than my first exposure, where school curriculum wanted it read like it was Pilgrim’s Progress. I needed the Bondanella introduction back then to dispense with the nonsense: “Such allegorical abstractions are simply not what Dante’s great poem is all about.</description></item><item><title>Paradiso</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paradiso/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paradiso/</guid><description>My dilemma since the early years of Sunday school: hell is more interesting than paradise. Thus, true to form, though I wanted to be contrary, [[books/inferno|Inferno]] is more interesting than any amount of heavenly light (so bright! so much dancing!), but get to that last line and you can’t help but feel the awe and poetry of it:</description></item><item><title>The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-autobiography-of-benvenuto-cellini/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 22:28:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-autobiography-of-benvenuto-cellini/</guid><description>Necromancy, assassinations, prison breaks, poisonings, stabbings (so many stabbings!!), pranks on Michelangelo… dude lived a life. Come for the adventure, stay for the fascinating glimpse into Renaissance life and art. I read because [[authors/lois mcmaster bujold|Bujold]] based part of [[books/the spirit ring|The Spirit Ring]] on Cellini and said fact was stranger than fiction… she was not wrong.</description></item><item><title>Machiavelli in Love</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/machiavelli-in-love/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/machiavelli-in-love/</guid><description>Ruggiero does it again: a great companion piece to months of Renaissance reading, including [[authors/niccolo machiavelli|Machiavelli]].</description></item><item><title>The Prince</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-prince/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-prince/</guid><description>Non-negotiable: read [[authors/ada palmer|Ada Palmer’s]] five-part (plus?) series on Machiavelli. I’ll wait. She makes sense of the enigma, the real Machiavelli, neither lionized nor maligned. The brave thinker; the frightened statesman. Charismatic, unorthodox, forming a response to the Borgia tyranny, trying to save his beloved Florence, playing pranks on the monks, centuries ahead of his time.</description></item><item><title>The Renaissance in Italy</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-renaissance-in-italy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-renaissance-in-italy/</guid><description>One of the most accessible yet in-depth histories I’ve read. Lively and engaging. It’s been my tour guide through the past month of [[authors/dante alighieri|Dante]], [[authors/benvenuto cellini|Cellini]], [[authors/niccolo machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[authors/ludovico ariosto|Ariosto]], et. al. Highly recommended.</description></item><item><title>Our History Is the Future</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/our-history-is-the-future/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 22:54:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/our-history-is-the-future/</guid><description>An excellent re-issue of a book that&amp;rsquo;s been on my to-read list since it first published in 2019. I&amp;rsquo;m glad it finally prompted me to get to it. It’s the history of two centuries of indigenous activism in the context of even broader indigenous exploitation and resistance, and it needs to be more widely known.</description></item><item><title>Pagans</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pagans/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 12:34:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pagans/</guid><description>About as beautifully (and concisely) written as you can get for a history book. Fabulous stuff. Some fav lines:
—Augustus revived a thing that had barely been invented in his own time: “old-time religion,” rather like the nearly postmodern version of Christianity invented in nineteenth-century America and called “fundamentalism.</description></item><item><title>The Dawn of Everything</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</guid><description>One would do well to read up on Graeber’s [[notes/what&amp;rsquo;s the point if we can&amp;rsquo;t have fun|theory of playfulness]]. I’d add C. Thi Nguyen’s [[notes/playfulness vs epistemic traps|playfulness vs epistemic traps]] too.
A concept I am utterly on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says vastly more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question.</description></item><item><title>The Origins of Totalitarianism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 15:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-origins-of-totalitarianism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Humankind</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</guid><description>On Hobbes v. Rousseau, Bregman sides clearly with Rousseau. I’m more of a mind with [[books/the dawn of everything|The Dawn of Everything]], wondering what we’re excluding by limiting ourselves to that binary. But I also think a little Rousseau-ism is a necessary and overdue corrective. It’s like when there’s a virus, so an antibiotic is needed, but then a return to healthy gut flora is this other third thing.</description></item></channel></rss>
