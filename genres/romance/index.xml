(Read them out of order, oops!) Lots of promise, but I think the difference in POV—floating omniscient instead of tight third—didn’t work quite as well for me, possibly because it’s such a high bar of difficulty, possibly because it’s much closer to Jane Austen’s voice, which means the differences in quality are glaring.</description></item><item><title>Delilah Green Doesn’t Care</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/delilah-green-doesnt-care/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:43:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/delilah-green-doesnt-care/</guid><description>One of those books where the friendships ALMOST outshine the romance. ALMOST. Everybody has arcs and character growth, even the exes; everybody contributes their piece of misunderstanding and conflict resolution to the plot.

I want to write something long and complex about the concept of family in this book (the Tarletons enfolding Valentine and Sir Horley and Periwinkle and practically every other stray into their own little world; the stitched-together warmth of the Delanceys’ parenting, wrapped around Peggy like a quilt; that spectacular ending of creating a new family when convention says it’s impossible).</description></item><item><title>Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation Vol 2</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 22:10:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/grandmaster-of-demonic-cultivation-vol-2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Restless Truth</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-restless-truth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 15:47:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-restless-truth/</guid><description>This was so close to being great. SO CLOSE. But overall, the book felt kind of like the menagerie on board the ship, let loose in all directions, refusing to be corralled. There were some structure/plot/writing choices that left me more stumped than dazzled.

What [[books/band sinister|Band Sinister]] was to 2018, Any Old Diamonds is to 2019. It’s SO good. An instant favorite.

There was so much I liked—mainly CLARA—but it’s so unnecessarily long. Like at least a hundred pages too long because there’s so much repetition and angst and constant unresolved horniness.

Together they embark on the worst elopement kidnapping elopement in history (per Belle, it’s not vainglorious to claim that when it’s true), and what ensues is a meditation on friendship, love, sexuality, identity, self-discovery, society, and home in a way that only Alexis Hall can do it.</description></item><item><title>The Duke at Hazard</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-duke-at-hazard/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-duke-at-hazard/</guid><description>I have a few auto-buy (auto-preorder) authors, but KJ Charles is the only one where I drop everything to start reading the day a new book comes out.

And let me tell you, just when I thought one of my favorite romances could not get better, the annotations add a new layer. Dare I say, much as I enjoyed them, the annotations in [[books/glitterland|Glitterland]] felt… superfluous?

Drastic measures were needed after so many historical romance duds lately, especially with duke in the title. I wanted something full of sweeping romance on a foggy moor, angst and glory and tenderness. This was the safest bet possible.
I liked it the first time, but I loved it this time.</description></item><item><title>Cash Delgado Is Living the Dream</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/cash-delgado-is-living-the-dream/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/cash-delgado-is-living-the-dream/</guid><description>This is so good.

Mike is middle-aged, gay, single, and lost, with no cultural script for how someone like him can find connection and happiness. He believes the best he can hope for is hookup apps and casual flings, until he meets the capricious Matteo and the enigmatic Dave, who each challenge him in different ways.</description></item><item><title>In Perpetuity</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/in-perpetuity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/in-perpetuity/</guid><description>Melancholy little novella about vampires stuck out of time in our modern world, besieged by the violent noises and smells as civilization encroaches upon them.

This was the latter, and not in a fun way.

The widowed Feyi hooks up with a stranger, then dates his best friend Nasir, then falls in love with Nasir’s father, and none of that sentence captures the raw transcendence of this novel.

I thought I had finally found the holy grail, cycling fiction (nay, romance!) that gets the cycling facts correct.

Which seems absurd to complain about, given how I just read and loved [[books/something extraordinary|Something Extraordinary]]—surely if anything is dialed up to 11 it’s the Tarletons.

Spoilery: %%it’s an f/f romance, and one half of the pair is affianced, to an amazing man, who’s gay, and they are going to use their marriage to give themselves and their true partners a safe harbor from society, and they go through with their marriage, and it’s just beautifully done, and… sniff I have a lot of feelings about friendships and healthy communication and unconventional choices and that kind of love.</description></item><item><title>Gwen &amp; Art Are Not in Love</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gwen-and-art-are-not-in-love/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 22:43:37 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gwen-and-art-are-not-in-love/</guid><description>I think it wobbled a smiiiidge on the landing, a few things felt abrupt and/or undercooked, not to mention the jarring tonal shift into violence, but the ride to get there was super fun.

Weirdly, the only character I was meh on was the love interest, just because he’s too perfect.
