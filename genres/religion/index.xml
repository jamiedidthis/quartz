Fabulous stuff. Some fav lines:
—Augustus revived a thing that had barely been invented in his own time: “old-time religion,” rather like the nearly postmodern version of Christianity invented in nineteenth-century America and called “fundamentalism.</description></item><item><title>Tao Te Ching: A New English Version</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tao-te-ching-a-new-english-version/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 15:55:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/tao-te-ching-a-new-english-version/</guid><description>Since I had [[books/tao te ching|Ursula K.

Pull quotes Nowhere is any such thing written: not in the Law of Moses, not in the prophets, not in the Psalms.
