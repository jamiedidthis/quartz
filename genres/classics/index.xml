These are real people and real places, not just an abstract Lewis-esque allegory. Now I wish I knew Italian to read his terza rima original, especially since I’ve had to dig through the Longfellow to see what’s underneath.</description></item><item><title>Purgatorio</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/purgatorio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/purgatorio/</guid><description>Reading this alongside Guido Ruggiero’s [[books/the renaissance in italy|The Renaissance in Italy]] is A+ recommended. Once again, vastly more interesting than my first exposure, where school curriculum wanted it read like it was Pilgrim’s Progress. I needed the Bondanella introduction back then to dispense with the nonsense: “Such allegorical abstractions are simply not what Dante’s great poem is all about.</description></item><item><title>Paradiso</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paradiso/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/paradiso/</guid><description>My dilemma since the early years of Sunday school: hell is more interesting than paradise. Thus, true to form, though I wanted to be contrary, [[books/inferno|Inferno]] is more interesting than any amount of heavenly light (so bright! so much dancing!), but get to that last line and you can’t help but feel the awe and poetry of it:</description></item><item><title>A Room with a View</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-room-with-a-view/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-room-with-a-view/</guid><description>It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
Wow. Re-read in one sitting. I was only going to read the Florence bits, but then I just didn’t stop. This is why I’m a fan of coming back to books at different ages with different eyes and different contexts, because it makes them different books.</description></item><item><title>Emma</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/emma/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/emma/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Howards End</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/howards-end/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/howards-end/</guid><description>At least this one holds up to my initial perception; it’s still my least favorite of the Forster novels.* The energy and wit are a feast for the senses, especially in the dialogue, but it’s so much about England and Empire, it gets, dare I say… tiresome?</description></item><item><title>Mansfield Park</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mansfield-park/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/mansfield-park/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Maurice</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/maurice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/maurice/</guid><description>I love this book because the characters are awful and snobby and wrong about so many things. Just like we’re awful and snobby and wrong in our own times. No historical revisionism, and still a happy ending. There’s great beauty within.
Not far from the lodge there was a nasty little climb, and the road, always in bad condition, was edged with dog roses that scratched the paint.</description></item><item><title>Northanger Abbey</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/northanger-abbey/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/northanger-abbey/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Persuasion</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/persuasion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/persuasion/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pride and Prejudice</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pride-and-prejudice/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pride-and-prejudice/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sanditon and Other Stories</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sanditon-and-other-stories/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sanditon-and-other-stories/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sense and Sensibility</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sense-and-sensibility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sense-and-sensibility/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Complete Novels</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-complete-novels/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:33:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-complete-novels/</guid><description>My aunt Brenda gave me this edition in 2007, and it’s the copy I use for all my annotations, so I can flip back and forth between books easily. The introduction by Karen Joy Fowler favors the Hollywood Jane much more than [[books/jane austen the secret radical|the political Jane]], and she gets some things flat out wrong (like claiming the quote about Emma, “a heroine no one by myself will much like,” is from Austen herself, when we have no record she said it).</description></item><item><title>The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-autobiography-of-benvenuto-cellini/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 22:28:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-autobiography-of-benvenuto-cellini/</guid><description>Necromancy, assassinations, prison breaks, poisonings, stabbings (so many stabbings!!), pranks on Michelangelo… dude lived a life. Come for the adventure, stay for the fascinating glimpse into Renaissance life and art. I read because [[authors/lois mcmaster bujold|Bujold]] based part of [[books/the spirit ring|The Spirit Ring]] on Cellini and said fact was stranger than fiction… she was not wrong.</description></item><item><title>Decameron</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/decameron/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 23:34:34 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/decameron/</guid><description>Hey, remember way back when there was this pandemic happening?

Slavitt takes liberties, and Reynolds has merit, but I’ve got to say, for compulsive readability, and cheeky irreverence that feels like it honors the spirit of the original, Slavitt it is.</description></item><item><title>The Great Gatsby</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-great-gatsby/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-great-gatsby/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Songs of Innocence and Experience</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/songs-of-innocence-and-experience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Dec 2023 16:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/songs-of-innocence-and-experience/</guid><description/></item><item><title>William Blake: The Complete Illuminated Books</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/william-blake-the-complete-illuminated-books/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 15:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/william-blake-the-complete-illuminated-books/</guid><description>Reading Blake, I always get the sense he’s working in a fever, trying to translate an ecstatic vision for us mortals. I saw someone call him the original troll—that too, the radical printmaker in the time when printmaking was a real threat to the established order.</description></item></channel></rss>
