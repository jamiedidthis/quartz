Highlights and takeaways, an incomplete list:
It’s not just that we make patterns; humans are basically incapable of doing things without patterns Young women are the language disrupters Twitter, where you’re encouraged to follow people you don’t already know, has more linguistic innovation (not to mention [[notes/memes and social movements|memes and social movements]]) than Facebook, where you primarily friend people you already know offline [[notes/the curse of latin-y grammar|The curse of Latin-y grammar]] Grammar and spelling are collective agreements, not eternal truths; collective agreements can change What teens are doing is sophisticated [[notes/linguistic play as a writing exercise|Linguistic play as a writing exercise]] Reshaping informal writing into something that could more deeply convey the full range of human emotions Incoherence is the invitation to create Our language about emotion is embodied; you believe their body, not their words Japanese (eastern) anime and emoticons emphasize the eyes; western emphasizes the mouth Illustrative emoji (the birthday cake; it means what it means) vs.</description></item><item><title>Annals of the Former World</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2023 14:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/annals-of-the-former-world/</guid><description>I’m glad I’m not beyond the age where books I read can change the way I see the world.

So many inaccuracies though! [[books/jesus apocalyptic prophet of the new millennium|Ehrman’s was better]].
Pull quotes Nowhere is any such thing written: not in the Law of Moses, not in the prophets, not in the Psalms. In the entire history of Jewish thought there is not a single line of scripture that says the messiah is to suffer, die, and rise again on the third day, which may explain why Jesus does not bother to cite any scripture to back up his incredible claim.</description></item><item><title>Entangled Life</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/entangled-life/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/entangled-life/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Hidden Life of Trees</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-hidden-life-of-trees/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-hidden-life-of-trees/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Health Communism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/health-communism/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 15:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/health-communism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A History of the Bible</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-history-of-the-bible/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-history-of-the-bible/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Out of Your Mind</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/out-of-your-mind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/out-of-your-mind/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Humankind</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</guid><description>On [[authors/thomas hobbes|Hobbes]] v. [[authors/jean-jacques rousseau|Rousseau]], Bregman sides clearly with Rousseau. I’m more of a mind with [[books/the dawn of everything|The Dawn of Everything]], wondering what we’re excluding by limiting ourselves to that binary. But I also think a little Rousseau-ism is a necessary and overdue corrective.</description></item><item><title>The Flowering Wand</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-flowering-wand/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 13:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-flowering-wand/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Room of One’s Own</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-room-of-ones-own/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-room-of-ones-own/</guid><description/></item><item><title>One Day I’ll Grow Up and Be a Beautiful Woman</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/one-day-ill-grow-up-and-be-a-beautiful-woman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/one-day-ill-grow-up-and-be-a-beautiful-woman/</guid><description>Nonfiction memoir about a mother raising her autistic, transgender daughter and the New Hampshire town that puts their family through hell. It’s harrowing and heartbreaking, a survival guide (barely? hopefully?) about weathering the eye of the current political storm.a I’m always looking for books I can recommend to well-meaning people who want to see past the transphobic headlines, and this one goes on the list.</description></item></channel></rss>
