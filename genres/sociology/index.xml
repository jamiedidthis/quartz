Lively and engaging. It’s been my tour guide through the past month of [[authors/dante alighieri|Dante]], [[authors/benvenuto cellini|Cellini]], [[authors/niccolo machiavelli|Machiavelli]], [[authors/ludovico ariosto|Ariosto]], et. al. Highly recommended.</description></item><item><title>Our History Is the Future</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/our-history-is-the-future/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 22:54:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/our-history-is-the-future/</guid><description>An excellent re-issue of a book that&amp;rsquo;s been on my to-read list since it first published in 2019. I&amp;rsquo;m glad it finally prompted me to get to it. It’s the history of two centuries of indigenous activism in the context of even broader indigenous exploitation and resistance, and it needs to be more widely known.</description></item><item><title>All About Love</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/all-about-love/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/all-about-love/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Pleasure Activism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pleasure-activism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pleasure-activism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Regretting Motherhood</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/regretting-motherhood/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/regretting-motherhood/</guid><description>“Thus, if we see motherhood as impervious to regret – even though regret may accompany all types of human relationships and decisions that we make – ==then we are not taking into account how feeling rules and culturally acceptable ideas about time are used to sustain social orders that are of most benefit to those who already have power in society – at the expense of many others.</description></item><item><title>The Dawn of Everything</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 12:00:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</guid><description>One would do well to read up on Graeber’s [[notes/what&amp;rsquo;s the point if we can&amp;rsquo;t have fun|theory of playfulness]]. I’d add C. Thi Nguyen’s [[notes/playfulness vs epistemic traps|playfulness vs epistemic traps]] too.
A concept I am utterly on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says vastly more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question.</description></item><item><title>The Right to Maim</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-right-to-maim/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 14:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-right-to-maim/</guid><description>In The Right to Maim Jasbir K. Puar brings her pathbreaking work on the liberal state, sexuality, and biopolitics to bear on our understanding of disability. Drawing on a stunning array of theoretical and methodological frameworks, Puar uses the concept of “debility”—bodily injury and social exclusion brought on by economic and political factors—to disrupt the category of disability.</description></item><item><title>Health Communism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/health-communism/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 15:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/health-communism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Humankind</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</guid><description>On Hobbes v. Rousseau, Bregman sides clearly with Rousseau. I’m more of a mind with [[books/the dawn of everything|The Dawn of Everything]], wondering what we’re excluding by limiting ourselves to that binary. But I also think a little Rousseau-ism is a necessary and overdue corrective. It’s like when there’s a virus, so an antibiotic is needed, but then a return to healthy gut flora is this other third thing.</description></item></channel></rss>
