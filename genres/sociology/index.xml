It’s encouraging to see such robust organizing among tenants across the country, and the practical template for how to expand it. The authors rightly quote [[authors/ursula k le guin|Ursula Le Guin]]: our housing system is a human power—produced by people, not God or nature.</description></item><item><title>Gender and Our Brains</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gender-and-our-brains/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:24:50 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/gender-and-our-brains/</guid><description>The takeaway: 19th century biological essentialism is bunk (duh), and the majority of crappy research in neurology and biology has been undertaken to prove that women are inferior (yay!). We don’t even know what we don’t know, because the pseudoscience myths we’ve inherited will NOT die; but it’s a gendered world that produces a gendered brain, not our biology.</description></item><item><title>Propaganda Blitz</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/propaganda-blitz/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 22:36:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/propaganda-blitz/</guid><description>For years I’ve wanted a successor to [[books/manufacturing consent|Manufacturing Consent]] that is a bit more current and accessible — this might not exactly fill those shoes, but it comes pretty damn close.

I&amp;rsquo;m glad it finally prompted me to get to it. It’s the history of two centuries of indigenous activism in the context of even broader indigenous exploitation and resistance, and it needs to be more widely known.</description></item><item><title>Pleasure Activism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pleasure-activism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/pleasure-activism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sister Outsider</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sister-outsider/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sister-outsider/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Democracy Project</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-democracy-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-democracy-project/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Internet Con</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-internet-con/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-internet-con/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-ultimate-hidden-truth-of-the-world/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Utopia of Rules</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-utopia-of-rules/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 01:39:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-utopia-of-rules/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Deviant Matter</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/deviant-matter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 23:29:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/deviant-matter/</guid><description>It’s a bummer that I am so very interested in the premise of this, but the dense academic writing, chock full of jargon, makes it nearly inaccessible.

Garringer crisscrosses the Bible Belt, collecting a scrapbook and oral history of various LGBTQ+ people living in the rural margins. The older interviewees—the elders who survived the AIDS crisis and more—are the best and most emotional part. It’s easy to get miffed when people act like the Brooklyn or San Francisco subcultures are the only ones that matter, or like gay and trans people don’t exist in the south except to be persecuted.</description></item><item><title>Manufacturing Consent</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/manufacturing-consent/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/manufacturing-consent/</guid><description>Infuriatingly and terrifyingly relevant. Like, up to this very day, where you couldn’t even update the book with current examples because there are too many to choose from. Venezuela, Syria, Iran. Ad infinitum. It’s all following the same script. Where you could argue the book is dated, that actually further proves its point, such as the west’s support and glorification of Putin thirty years ago when he fit their needs in a different way.</description></item><item><title>Refusing Compulsory Sexuality</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/refusing-compulsory-sexuality/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/refusing-compulsory-sexuality/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Dawn of Everything</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 12:44:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/the-dawn-of-everything/</guid><description>A concept I am on board with: that the assumptions we make about archeological finds or the historical record says more about our own mindset (unexamined prejudices) than the period in question.
For example: in trying to locate the so-called “agricultural revolution,” we look only for the traits we expect and overlook anything that doesn’t conform.</description></item><item><title>A History of Gay Literature</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-history-of-gay-literature/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 22:26:41 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/a-history-of-gay-literature/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Metaphors We Live By</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/metaphors-we-live-by/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/metaphors-we-live-by/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sensoria</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sensoria/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 21:41:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/sensoria/</guid><description>The tragic side of life is never far away.

Puar brings her pathbreaking work on the liberal state, sexuality, and biopolitics to bear on our understanding of disability. Drawing on a stunning array of theoretical and methodological frameworks, Puar uses the concept of “debility”—bodily injury and social exclusion brought on by economic and political factors—to disrupt the category of disability.</description></item><item><title>Health Communism</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/health-communism/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 15:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/health-communism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Humankind</title><link>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 15:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notebook.jamieharris.co/books/humankind/</guid><description>On [[authors/thomas hobbes|Hobbes]] v. [[authors/jean-jacques rousseau|Rousseau]], Bregman sides clearly with Rousseau.

Recommended to absolutely anyone, with or without a uterus, with or without the intention to procreate. It’s ostensibly about pregnancy loss and miscarriage/stillbirth awareness, but that overlaps with many things—abortion, grief, medical misogyny, racial injustice, human rights.</description></item></channel></rss>
